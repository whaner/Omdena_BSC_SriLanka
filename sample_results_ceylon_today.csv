ONLY FOUR CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS FOR OVER 6M CHILDREN,"BY Paneetha Ameresekere Rupee or domestic credit by the banking and monetary sectors to the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and public corporations continued to overshadow credit to the private sector for the seventh consecutive month to February 2022, a phenomenon last seen nearly 33 years ago in 1989, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data of Friday’s (8 April) showed. For instance, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,331 billion in February 2022, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 7,051 billion in that month, the former being more by Rs 280 billion over the latter. And in the previous month January 2022, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,236 billion, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 7,017 billion that month, the former being more by Rs 219 billion over the latter. Meanwhile, in December 2021, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,467.9 billion, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 6,981.4 billion, the former being more by Rs 486.5 billion over the latter. In November 2021, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,259 billion and credit to the private sector Rs 6,920.1 billion, an increase of Rs 338.9 billion. Similarly, in the months of October, September and August 2021 these respective figures were Rs 7,116.8 billion and Rs 6,859.6 billion, Rs 6,915.2 billion and Rs 6,824.6 billion and Rs 6,819 billion and Rs 6,795.5 billion, increases of Rs 257.2 billion, Rs 90.6 billion and Rs 23.5 billion, respectively.   Previously, such a phenomenon occurred for 10 consecutive months, from January 1989 to October 1989, CBSL data showed. Three matters of political interest, coinciding with those developments took place during that earlier period. They were President Ranasinghe Premadasa being elected to power at the Presidential Poll of 19 December 1988 and taking over from President J.R. Jayewardene who went into retirement on 31 December 1988, the IPKF fighting the LTTE in the North and East of the country and the JVP fighting the GoSL in the rest of the country. However, coinciding with the killing of JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera by the Army on 13 November 1989, private sector credit once more overtook credit to both the GoSL and public corporations together beginning from that month, before its collapse nearly 32 years later  in August 2021 and continuing to play second fiddle to the GoSL and public corporations till February 2022, according to latest CBSL data. By Dilanthi Jayamanne In a startling revelation, Prof. Miyuru Chandradasa, a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at the Colombo North Teaching Hospital (CNTH) in Ragama, said there are only four Consultant Child Psychiatrists within the entire State health sector at the moment, despite a population of 6 million children in the country. This alarming scarcity underscores a pressing need for more child psychiatrists to meet the growing need for mental health services among children. Speaking to Ceylon Today on Friday (9), Prof. Chandradasa highlighted the lack of both sufficient numbers and resources to adequately support them. Expressing concern, he explained that the shortage persists as qualified psychiatric experts often migrate abroad due to inadequate compensation for their specialised skills, within the country. Prof. Chandradasa underscored the urgent need for at least 25 child psychiatrists to serve the 25 districts of Sri Lanka, emphasising the critical gap in mental health services for children. In parallel, Dr. Deepal Perera, a Consultant Paediatrician at Lady Ridgeway Hospital, highlighted a concerning trend of children being brought in with stress-related conditions, attributed to academic pressures and schoolwork. Dr. Perera observed an increase in children reporting symptoms such as wheezing, abdominal pain, headaches and sleep disturbances, despite medical investigations revealing no physiological issues. He emphasised that these symptoms primarily stem from psychosocial challenges, indicating a growing need for comprehensive attention to address mental health issues among children and adolescents.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe delivered a speech at the 7th Indian Ocean Conference in Perth, focusing on the theme ‘Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean’. He highlighted the critical need for enhanced connectivity infrastructure to accommodate the projected eight-fold increase in the GDP of countries like India and Indonesia by 2050. Existing channels like the Suez Canal may not be adequate, necessitating new initiatives. India’s proposed Mumbai-Iran-Russia and Mumbai-Middle East-Europe corridors, along with projects in the Bay of Bengal and the Chongqing-Kyaukphyu corridor, aim to address this demand. Additionally, plans for the Kra land bridge by Thailand and feasibility studies for land connectivity between India and Sri Lanka underscore efforts to establish Sri Lanka as a Regional Logistics Hub, facilitating trade with South India. President Wickremesinghe highlighted the historical significance of Perth in Sri Lanka-Australia relations, particularly during World War II when Royal Canadian Air Force Catalina Flying Boats established a crucial air link between Perth and Koggala Air Base in Ceylon, facilitating vital communication for the Allies. He emphasised the importance of the Indian Ocean, especially in light of historical events such as the Japanese attacks on Ceylon in 1942, which Winston Churchill described as a critical moment in the war. He discussed the multipolarity of the Indian Ocean region, shaped by events like the Bandung Conference in 1955 and the subsequent Non-Aligned Movement, which opposed big power rivalry. The speech outlined various diplomatic frameworks and groupings that have emerged in the Indian Ocean region, including IORA, Indo-Pacific, BRI, QUAD, and BRICS, along with increased militarization by several countries, leading to a complex geopolitical landscape. Wickremesinghe also highlighted the growing strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean, particularly in light of geopolitical shifts and the influence of major powers like Russia, China and Iran. He addressed challenges such as attacks on commercial vessels by Houthi rebels, piracy, and threats to freedom of navigation, emphasising the need for collective action to address these issues. Furthermore, Wickremesinghe emphasised the urgency of addressing the climate crisis, noting the Indian Ocean’s vulnerability to warming and rising sea levels. He proposed initiatives such as the Tropical Belt Initiative and the International Climate Change University to mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure climate justice for vulnerable countries. In conclusion, Wickremesinghe called for unity among Indian Ocean Rim countries to address shared challenges and create a safer, more sustainable ocean environment. He advocated for the development of an overarching regional architecture for the Indian Ocean, emphasizing the responsibility of IORA leaders in achieving this goal. The event, themed ‘Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean’, aims to foster cooperation among 40 participating nations. This conference was organised by the India Foundation in collaboration with India’s Ministry of External Affairs and the Australian Government, along with support from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore and Perth-US Asia Centre. Singapore’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan and India’s Minister of External Affairs, Dr. Subramanian Jaishankar, also attended the event.

By Mithun Jayawardhana The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) have so far failed to start any investigation into the Sri Lankans mentioned in the Pandora Papers, Ceylon Today reliably learns. The Pandora Papers are 11.9 million leaked documents with 2.9 terabytes of data that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) published, beginning on 3 October 2021. The leak exposed the secret offshore accounts of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers, and heads of State as well as more than 100 billionaires, celebrities and business leaders. The documents revealed how Nirupama Rajapaksa and her husband, businessman Thirukumar Nadesan, had used secretive shell companies and trusts to accumulate more than USD 18 million in tax havens and own artworks and luxury properties in London and Sydney. Both, the IRD and the CIABOC have started preliminary investigations in this regard, but no person has been questioned so far. On 13 October 2021, it was stated to the media that a special investigation was initiated in accordance with the powers assigned to the Inland Revenue Department regarding the matter. Also, in September 2021, the CIABOC had also started several investigations in this connection. When JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake questioned the government on 8 March 2022, in Parliament under the Standing Order 27/2, as to whether there was any investigation launched to into the Sri Lankans mentioned in Pandora Papers, then Chief Government Whip Johnston Fernando said that an investigation has been started and the report will be submitted to the parliament within a week. However, no such report has been received by Parliament so far as well. Accordingly, it has been over two years, but the IRD or the CIABOC have failed to initiate investigations into the matter and no one has been questioned either. Ceylon Today also learns that the IRD needs to collect a lot of information such as checking the files related to the tax payments of the people mentioned in the Pandora papers, information regarding tax evasion and information required by the Court, but the work has not been done properly. Accordingly, the IRD should look into tax evasion, illegal accumulation of wealth and money laundering by individuals including businessmen and politicians. He also stated that IRD has not fulfilled its responsibilities properly according to the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 and the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 45 of 2022. In this regard, IRD Commissioner General W.A.S. Chandrasekara, when queried, said “You can find out about this from the media officer of the IRD. I will tell him to contact you. He will give you information about this. I will give him your phone number.”. However, no response was received even though 85 phone calls were made to the phone number 0112135300. On 6 September 2021, former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa instructed the CIABOC to conduct an immediate investigation into the facts revealed about Sri Lanka by the Pandora papers and provide the report within a month. Meanwhile, writing to the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Thirukumar Nadesan claimed that he guarantees that he and his wife are completely innocent and not guilty of any crime. He has further requested the President to appoint an independent investigator, such as a retired Court of Appeal Judge to investigate the matter as he and his wife have been affected by this incident. However, when the CIABOC was contacted to inquire about this, Commissioner K.B. Rajapaksa said to inquire about the matter from the CIABOC secretary. Accordingly, the CIABOC secretary was contacted after 22 calls through telephone numbers 0112596363 and 0112563713, but she stated that she could not comment on the matter to the media and that the media department should be contacted for that. More than 100 calls were made to the CIABOC’s media unit’s phone number 0112550062 provided by the secretary, but no response was received.

Corrupt officials pose major hurdle – Aluthgamage,"BY Paneetha Ameresekere Rupee or domestic credit by the banking and monetary sectors to the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and public corporations continued to overshadow credit to the private sector for the seventh consecutive month to February 2022, a phenomenon last seen nearly 33 years ago in 1989, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data of Friday’s (8 April) showed.

By Mithun Jayawardhana The intervention of the Inland Revenue Department and the Ministry of Finance is insufficient to amend the Inland Revenue Act and the corrupt practices of officials within these departments would not support the proposed amendments, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage told Ceylon Today. Aluthgamage, who was the Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Economic and Physical Plans before the proroguing of the Fourth Session of the Ninth Parliament, highlighted an issue regarding alcohol manufacturers who have failed to pay taxes. Despite recommendations from a Sectoral Oversight Committee suggesting that licences given to such alcohol manufacturers should not be renewed by the Excise Department, he noted that their licences were nevertheless renewed, citing a lack of recommendation from the Finance Ministry Secretary. Moreover, he criticised the current alignment of the Excise Department, suggesting that it should prioritise State interests rather than advocating for alcohol manufacturers and liquor shop owners. Speaking further, Aluthgamage emphasised that the existing Inland Revenue Act is geared towards tax evasion rather than tax payment, calling for reforms to address this issue. He noted the absence of specific criminal laws in Sri Lanka to punish tax evasion, advocating for negotiations to rectify this situation. Additionally, Aluthgamage raised concerns about the lack of proper inspection of goods by Sri Lanka Customs, estimating that 5 per cent of received goods go uninspected daily, potentially hindering the Government’s revenue collection efforts.

Muttiah Muralitharan: In a league of his own,"BY Paneetha Ameresekere Rupee or domestic credit by the banking and monetary sectors to the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and public corporations continued to overshadow credit to the private sector for the seventh consecutive month to February 2022, a phenomenon last seen nearly 33 years ago in 1989, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data of Friday’s (8 April) showed.

R. Ashwin is one away from 500 Test wickets. James Anderson needs five more victims to reach 700 Test wickets. Both bowlers, in the twilight of their decorated careers (yes, we’ve been expecting Anderson to hang his boots for at least five years now), are expected to touch these significant milestones next week when the riveting action resumes with the third Test between India and England in Rajkot next week. Impressive as the numbers of these contemporary greats are, this is perhaps an appropriate moment to marvel at the man at the top of this exalted list of highest wicket-takers in Test cricket: Muttiah Muralitharan. Because Anderson has been at it for 21 years and Ashwin for 13, and yet they are a considerable distance away from the magical mark of 800 that the legendary off-spinner breached in the last of his 133 Tests in 2010. While Muralitharan stands on his own having set this statistical benchmark, he is also the fastest to 400, 500, 600 and 700 Test wickets. The magnitude of Muralitharan’s feat has perhaps not been celebrated as much as it ought to be. The fact that he didn’t eloquently articulate his craft and talk up his achievements to the wider world may have played a part, but 800 Test wickets is just as otherworldly and out of reach as Don Bradman’s Test average of 99.94. Unlike his famed spin rival Shane Warne, whose first steps to greatness came in his second year as an international cricketer with the ‘ball of the century’ to Mike Gatting, Muralitharan took his time finding his feet. He needed 27 Tests to get to 100 wickets, which as many as 12 players have achieved in less than 20 matches. He was also battling the insecurity of plying his trade with a bowling action that was under incessant scrutiny, with bitter experiences of being called for chucking by umpires in Australia dominating his early career. The turning point arrived in 1998 when Muralitharan returned figures of 7/155 and 9/65 in a one-off Test against England at The Oval in London that Sri Lanka won by 10 wickets. It was Sri Lanka’s first victory on English soil and told us that Muralitharan, who had taken most of his scalps at home till then, could be just as much of a force in unfamiliar territory. He claimed 68 wickets in eight Tests that year, showing first glimpses of the bowler who would go on to become Sri Lanka’s greatest match-winner. Years later, Muralitharan termed his match haul of 16 wickets at The Oval as a career highlight. “Everyone thought I was a good bowler then and I didn’t look back from there,” Muralitharan was quoted as saying by BBC in 2007. If Warne had a languid approach to the bowling crease before casting a spell on the batter at the other end, Muralitharan’s flapping arms, diagonal run-up and bulging eyes at the point of delivery provided no less of a spectacle. Where Muralitharan was unique as an off-spinner was in his propensity to turn the ball a mile, using a congenitally bent right arm to his advantage to bamboozle batters around the world. Sample Muralitharan’s dismissal of former England left-hand batter Mark Butcher at Edgbaston in 2002, the ball pitching probably a metre outside his leg stump before exploding and hitting the top of off stump. That a genial smile followed these deadly deliveries added to the theatre. Muralitharan produced these moments ever so often, leaving batters perennially confused by the sharp spin and fizz on the ball. The only way they could counter Muralitharan in his early years was by using their front pad rather than bat and remember this was a time when they could get away because technology wasn’t equipped to show the projected path of the ball for leg-before dismissals. Muralitharan mastered the doosra — invented by Pakistan’s Saqlain Mushtaq — in response, causing further problems by spinning the ball prodigiously either way now. It added another dimension to Muralitharan’s armoury, as the second half of his career clearly illustrates. After reaching 300 scalps in 58 Tests, he zoomed to subsequent century milestones at a rapid rate — he took just 14 Tests to go to 400, 15 for 500, 14 for 600, 12 for 700 and 20 for 800. When Muralitharan announced his retirement ahead of the first Test against India in Galle in 2010, he needed eight more to reach 800 scalps. It was as if he had thrown himself a challenge one final time, and he didn’t disappoint, with figures of 5/63 and 3/128 across the two innings ensuring that his incredible tally was rounded off at exactly 800. Another staggering number from Muralitharan’s illustrious Test career is his five-wicket hauls — 67, which is 30 more than Warne who is second on the list. That ‘records are meant to be broken’ is a common expression in competitive sport. But there are some numbers, like Muralitharan’s 800, that are likely to stand the test of time and keep reminding us of the Sri Lankan’s genius.

By Dilanthi Jayamanne Consultant Paediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Borella Dr. Deepal Perera said that dry weather conditions and up- coming sports meets and big matches could rouse dust enough to cause respiratory tract issues in children. Dr. Perera said on Friday (8) observed that Lady Ridgeway Hospital was currently seeing a sizable number of patients with respiratory tract infections. Children sometimes show symptoms like cough and difficulty in breathing. Some children do not understand what to say, so their stomach hurts, they say their chest hurts. But prevailing conditions could trigger asthma in children who have had the condition for a long period. Dusty conditions during school sports events and cricket matches could even add new cases of child asthma, he noted. The Consultant Paediatrician also warned that there was a high risk for children to developed asthma if they were exposed to tobacco smoke emanating from cigarettes smoked by their fathers or grandfathers, he lamented. Smoking was not good for the person who smokes, but it is also not good for passive smokers who were highly vulnerable to wheezing and cancers as a result. He urged parents and relatives to be more conscious of young children when smoking. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Additionally, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, along with Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, are also part of this delegation. Meanwhile, UNP General Secretary Palitha Rangebandara observed that the SJB had begun to splinter, signalling the beginning of its demise. He noted that SJB MPs are gradually aligning themselves with the President, accompanying him on foreign trips to gain political exposure. Rangebandara pointed out that MPs Kins Nelson, Vadivel Suresh and Ajith aMannapperuma have already joined the President on recent State visits to Uganda, the US and Cuba, respectively. Further, Rangebandara suggested that influential figures from the main opposition, such as SJB Chairman and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, are also rallying behind the UNP Leader. He predicted that the Opposition Leader would struggle to prevent his party from being swept away in a political storm in the near future.

BY T.K.G. Kapila – Katunayake A group of 66 Sri Lankans, previously employed at two apparel factories in Jordan, faced adversity when the factories abruptly closed down. The factories, operated by Indian investors under the names ‘Aseel’ and ‘High Apparel’, ceased operations without warning, leaving the workers in distress. In a positive turn of events, these Sri Lankan workers have now returned to their homeland. They arrived at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake on Friday (9) morning after ensuring they received their owed salaries and other benefits. The Sri Lankan Embassy in Jordan has announced that additional workers from these factories will be repatriated within the next two days. This follows a similar effort in January, where 41 Sri Lankans were successfully repatriated after settling their salary and social security claims. Furthermore, the Embassy has disclosed that 30 workers from the affected factories had previously secured employment at other garment factories in Jordan with their consent. This ongoing support demonstrates the collaborative efforts between the eEmbassy, factory management and Jordanian authorities to assist these workers during this challenging time.

By Buwanaka S. Perera The main Opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), will join hands with minority parties and some Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) members, who have clean hands, to form the biggest political alliance, SJB Secretary General Ranjith Maddumabandara said. Speaking to Ceylon Today, Maddumbandara said that they have held discussions with more than 20 parties and political factions and some have shown interest in joining SJB directly as a member of the party while others would form an alliance with the opposition party. He further said that the new alliance will consist of members of minority parties and members of SLPP who do not have any allegations. When questioned about how allowing career politicians, especially MPs from SLPP into the party could conflict with the Opposition Leader’s aspirations for a “system change”, Maddumabandara said that once these individuals join the party, they will not be able to follow the old system but rather adapt and adhere to the SJB party’s system.

BY Methmalie Dissanayake Minister of Urban Development Prasanna Ranatunga assured Parliament on Friday (9) that the historic Visumpaya would not be sold below the price estimated by the Valuation Department. In response to a question raised by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, regarding the iconic building, Minister Ranatunga said the government has no intention of deviating from the price recommended by the Valuation Department for Visumpaya and the building will not be sold below the assessment of the Valuation Department. He elaborated, “However, in response to the investor’s request, we have agreed to commission another valuation through a chartered valuer. The investor has requested a six-month period to complete this updated valuation.” Ranatunga reiterated the government’s commitment to ensuring maximum transparency throughout the transaction process. Nonetheless, he acknowledged the government’s limitations in independently developing the property. According to reports, the government has valued the property at nine billion rupees, while the investor has made an offer of four billion rupees. The government’s vision is to repurpose Visumpaya into a heritage hotel. Constructed 190 years ago during the colonial era and originally named ‘Ackland House’, Visumpaya served as the Mess House for Officers of the Ceylon Rifles Regiment. Over time, it evolved into the Manager’s Quarters and Office for the Colombo Commercial Company, a prominent entity in commercial trade of that era. In 1971, the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Government acquired the building under the Business (Acquisition) Act No. 35 of 1971 as part of its nationalisation initiative. Subsequently, it became the official residence of D. M. Jayaratne, the 14th Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. Anura Bandaranaike, the former Minister and Speaker, passed away within its premises. Now recognised as a heritage site, Visumpaya is slated for conversion into a boutique hotel. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

BY Methmalie Dissanayake During the recent visit to India, the primary focus of discussions with the Indian Government revolved around regional security, said NPP MP Vijitha Herath in a media debriefing at Party Headquarters in Pelawatta. The delegation concluded its five-day visit to India and held a media briefing at the JVP Headquarters in Pelawatta yesterday (11). Responding to a query, Herath explained, “The main focus of our discussions centred on regional security, particularly in South Asia. We deliberated on various geopolitical threats that could potentially undermine regional stability. We assured our Indian counterparts that we are committed to safeguarding regional security while upholding our nation’s sovereignty. It’s imperative to note that our national security measures inherently contribute to regional security.” Regarding diplomatic relations with China, Herath clarified that India did not impose any restrictions or directives on maintaining ties with China. He emphasised that such matters are not pertinent to the NPP’s stance. When asked if the discussions with India would impact the NPP’s relations with China, Herath underscored that the party has a history of engaging with both India and China. He reaffirmed the NPP’s consistent stance on maintaining connections with various countries while safeguarding the national interest. For instance, he highlighted the NPP’s opposition to the previous government’s decision to lease the Hambantota Port to China, emphasising that their political stance remains unwavering regardless of discussions held with India or China. Herath said the trip was not an impromptu one but had in response to an invitation received last December. However, due to their tight, they had postponed it until February, ultimately reducing the visit from the initially planned ten days to five. He explained that India had initially extended a ten-day invitation, but the NPP opted to curtail it due to their prior commitments and internal party activities. He highlighted that this wasn’t the NPP’s maiden diplomatic invitation, citing a previous visit by NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and a delegation to China, albeit with less publicity compared to the latest India visit. Herath speculated that the significance accorded to the Indian visit stems from the party’s prior stances on Indian affairs. “There has been much speculation surrounding this visit. However, it’s important to emphasise that we, as a political faction, possess a comprehensive understanding of the present geopolitics. Therefore, we do not pay heed to such speculations. Our visit to India is aimed at serving the interests of the public. The geopolitical landscape has evolved significantly since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Today, there exist various influential factions such as the United States, China, India, the European Union, and Latin America, among others. In the 1980s, Sri Lanka experienced direct interference from India. Many are aware of the attempted Indian military intervention and the Indo-Lanka Agreement. We vehemently opposed such efforts to safeguard our sovereignty. However, the political landscape has undergone significant change since then. Presently, our country faces economic challenges, and it is imperative that we rebuild both economically and politically with a clear vision.” Responding to queries regarding any assurances or support from India for future elections, Herath categorically stated that no such discussions had taken place, emphasising that countries endorse democratically elected governments rather than political parties vying for power. Regarding the NPP’s stance on Indian investors like Adani and Amul, Herath said their protest centered around the selection of investors through unsolicited proposals. He reiterated that an NPP administration would welcome investors from any nation but stressed the importance of transparent investment processes and adherence to due tender procedures. Reflecting on the visit’s outcomes, Herath deemed it successful and hinted at implementing several lessons learnt from the trip should an NPP government come to power.
