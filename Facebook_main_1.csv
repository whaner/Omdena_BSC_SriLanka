2,"As Sri Lanka's economic and political crisis deepens, the government has proposed a new Employment Act that would reform 13 existing labor laws. This means extending working hours, eliminating unfair dismissal protections, and limiting union and collective bargaining rights. There are also concerns that the process of reforming labor laws is community-centered and democratic. Specially avoiding the labor advisory council established by the government and resorting to these reforms raises questions about the democratic nature of the process. This reform will further worsen the plight of workers, worsened by the pandemic and the economic crisis. These are some of the ideas presented in this regard.

5,"On 2nd February, HRD Oleg Orlov was labeled a foreign agent by the Ministry of Justice for opposing Russia’s war in Ukraine. This occured at the same time as an ongoing investigation, where he and his lawyer were given a severely limited time-frame to study the case file with several investigation documents. The renewed investigation follows Orlov's alleged “public actions aimed at discrediting the use of Russian Federation armed forces to protect the interests of the Russian Federation.”

Orlov is a prominent human rights defender and council member of HRDC ""Memorial,"" and has a long history of advocating for human rights. He  was awarded the Sakharov Prize in 2009.  His recent legal challenges and foreign agent designation raise concerns about the targeting of human rights defenders in Russia.

Front Line Defenders strongly condemns his persecution and calls for the dismissal of all charges against him. We are seriously concerned with the Russian Government's continued use of foreign agents laws to suppress human rights work in the country.

These accusations followed his investigation and documentation of the pollution of Lake Izabal and the coverage of a protest by Maya Q'eqchi' communities and artisanal fishermen, where fisherman Carlos Maaz was killed in 2017.

While Front Line Defenders welcomes the conclusion, it condemns Carlos Ernesto Choc’s prosecution and Guatemala’s context of criminalisation and harassment against community journalists and HRDs.

As Sri Lanka's economic and political crisis deepens, the government has proposed a new Employment Act that would reform 13 existing labor laws. This means extending working hours, eliminating unfair dismissal protections, and limiting union and collective bargaining rights. There are also concerns that the process of reforming labor laws is community-centered and democratic. Specially avoiding the labor advisory council established by the government and resorting to these reforms raises questions about the democratic nature of the process. This reform will further worsen the plight of workers, worsened by the pandemic and the economic crisis. These are some of the ideas presented in this regard.",1706865079,0,Law & Society Trust,2024-02-02T09:11:19.000Z

11 August 2023
Colombo, Sri Lanka

𝗪𝗘 𝗗𝗢𝗡'𝗧 𝗢𝗪𝗘! 𝗪𝗘 𝗪𝗢𝗡'𝗧 𝗣𝗔𝗬! 
𝗪𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗦𝗿𝗶 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗸𝗮 𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗲𝗯𝘁 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘀

Women’s rights groups in Sri Lanka reject the current debt restructuring solutions that place the burden of repayment on Sri Lanka’s working classes, particularly its women. They are demanding urgent and sustainable solutions to the ongoing debt crisis in Sri Lanka, that respond to the actual lived experiences, struggles and needs of the people. 

At the ‘National Convening on Debt and Women’s Human Rights’ held in Colombo on 9-10 August 2023, women’s rights groups from Sri Lanka and other Asian countries discussed the ways the ongoing crisis has impacted their lives and the inadequacy of government solutions to respond in meaningful ways. They also severely criticised the historical and current roles played by international financial institutions mainly the World Bank and IMF in imposing unjust austerity measures and their lack of accountability in worsening economic crises in the region. 

Sri Lanka is currently going through a crippling economic crisis because of an unsustainable debt burden of 103.8% of GDP as of March 2023. This crisis hit households at a time when many had not yet recovered from the shocks of COVID-19. The government response of austerity measures to secure an International Monetary Fund bailout are being hurriedly rolled out, with no public consultation. This has included cuts in public spending, steep increases in utility tariffs, food and energy costs, indirect and regressive taxation, limited cash handouts as social security. 

This has particularly impacted low to middle income families, and labour laws that threaten to rollback gains in wage and job security, especially for women. Critically, the Government of Sri Lanka has decided to use the earnings of the Employee Provident Funds to repay Sri Lanka’s debt - forcing Sri Lanka’s working class to bear the burden of repaying the wealthiest creditors - and has blocked resistance and legal challenges to the same. 

“The social security funds of workers are being compromised to pay the debt for the richest income earners in the world. The government has decided to trade off the savings - for many of them this is the only savings - of some of the most hardworking people in Sri Lanka,” said lawyer and activist, Lakmali Hemachandra. “There are severe violations going on with the domestic debt restructuring. The restructuring process is due to finish in September and by that time, workers will lose the security of their savings. We need the international community to hear and condemn the fact that creditors are being paid with workers' savings and the Government and IMF is continuing to hold the position that there is people’s buy-in for this. There is no people's buy-in, people just don’t have a way to communicate that,” Hemachandra said.

The Convening reaffirmed that women are disproportionately affected by both the economic crisis and current state solutions to restructure the debt. Due to their unpaid caregiving roles at household level, women often shoulder responsibilities of ensuring families are fed, looked after and educated, even as they face falling wages, rising food, electricity and water bills, precarious and informal employment and lack of access to meaningful social security. “Households can only meet their basic food needs by taking daily loans, weekly loans and other borrowing at very high interest rates. We cannot manage basic needs with our income anymore. How is this fair?” said Suganya Kandeepan, Feminist Collective for Economic Justice.     

Social security is not charity but a human right of all people. Women’s groups are demanding that universal social security in this time of crisis be made binding and enforceable by law. Without meaningful expansion of social safety nets and increasing fiscal allocation, targeted schemes like Aswesuma will not benefit the millions of families hit hard by the crisis. “In order to fund universal social security, we demand the government start taxing the rich, taxing corporations and reduce regressive consumer taxes like VAT with immediate effect, and expand budgetary allocation for social security beyond the current limit of 0.6% of GDP. We need to also expand social security to include other forms of support to relieve stress on household debt: guaranteed days of work, weekly nutritional food basket, health and education support, and transport support.” - Sarala Emmanuel, Feminist Collective for Economic Justice. 

Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, Former UN Independent Expert on Debt and Human Rights said, “We also need to question why only domestic creditors have been asked by the government to make a sacrifice and accept, to some extent, a haircut in their credit. External debt holders should also be asked to make a similar contribution to bring sovereign debt to a sustainable level. According to international law, in the Sri Lankan context, prohibition of discrimination means inter-creditor equity in sovereign debt restructuring.”

Sri Lanka is one of several countries in Asia and the Pacific currently grappling with the impacts of a debt crisis. Women’s rights groups across Asia Pacific have expressed solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka, with Regional Coordinator of APWLD Misun Woo saying, “It is outrageous to hear countless similar stories of violence women go through in a debt crisis.  Women’s stories across Asia and the Pacific confirm that there is a ‘debt formula’ which is a clear manifestation of neo colonialism and imperialism that takes away peoples’ life, dignity and sovereign power.  APWLD stands in solidarity with women and peoples of Sri Lanka and joins your struggles for justice and freedom. “

The national convening was co-organised by the Law & Society Trust (LST), NAFSO Sri Lanka, Women and Media Collective (WMC), Colombo Urban Lab, The Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD). Participants included representatives from groups of labour activists, trade unions, rural and urban women, academia, and civil society from Sri Lanka and Asia.

In collaboration with esteemed partner organizations Rajarata Praja Kendraya (RPK), Community Strength Development Foundation (CSDF), Federation of Social Development Organizations (FOSDOO), Centre for Women’s Research (CENWOR) and Sri Lanka College of Journalism (SLCJ), we organized an incredible symposium at Waters Edge on 16th of June 2023.

Over 150 amazing individuals participated in this inspiring event, including Ms. Sewwandi Yapa and Ms. Dharshani Premaratne from the European Union, Ms. Chamila Jayasundara, Chief Inspector of Police of the Women and Child Abuse Prevention Unit, and Dr. Janaki Vidanapathirana, Director of Policy Analysis and Development, Ministry of Health. We were honoured to have representatives from donor organizations Dr. Ramya Jirasinghe (Kindernothilfe) and Ms. Dharshani Abeykoon and Ms Anuradhi Perera (The Asia Foundation), along with many other passionate individuals representing NGOs/INGOs.

This event created an opportunity to showcase the remarkable achievements of our project, which focuses on mobilizing, organizing, and empowering marginalized groups of women, particularly Single Women (SW), Deserted Women (DW), and Female Sex Workers (FSW) in eight districts of Sri Lanka. We emphasized the positive transformations in their lives, including advancements in Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) and efforts to combat discrimination and violence. 

A highlight of this Symposium was the presentation of the Policy briefs by Dr. Ramani Jayatilaka, based on the three action researches conducted on Single Women, Deserted Women and Female Sex workers by Centre for Women’s Research (CENWOR).

Our project aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Target 16.2, Target 5.2, and Target 16.1. Together, we are working towards ending abuse, violence, exploitation, trafficking and discrimination against children, women and girls on a global scale.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all the participants, partners, and supporters who made this symposium a resounding success! Let's continue to empower women and create a brighter, more equal future for all.

Today, we gathered to remember his legacy and honor his contributions by offering flowers at the memorial statue. 

Dr. Tiruchelvam was a legal visionary and a committed advocate of human rights and the rule of law. He believed that the law could and should be an instrument to secure civil rights, social and economic justice and that development should prioritise uplifting people’s lives.

He believed that ethno-religious pluralism and diversity should be celebrated rather than be suppressed. He studied political and other arrangements across the world, seeking inspiration and examples that provided for unity in diversity.

Law and Society Trust was founded by Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam in June of 1982. He was a director of both the Law & Society Trust (LST) and the International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES), and a Senior Partner of Tiruchelvam Associates — a leading law firm in Sri Lanka.

Dr Tiruchelvam was assassinated by a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) suicide bomber in July 1999.

Media Release

A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN THE NEW YEAR

Addressing a gathering of religious leaders by Religions for Peace International and its Sri Lankan chapter on December 19, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said that the majority of people do not want another conflict even though politicians cannot resist using the ethnic card.  She insisted the Sri Lankan people were not racist but were provoked by politicians.   She said that public opinion had turned favourable for a political solution based on inter-ethnic power sharing and devolution of power to the provincial level from 23 percent to 68 percent in a matter of two years.  The National Peace Council believes that the present time is opportune for a breakthrough to a political solution.  We recall President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s pledge a year ago that he would ensure a political solution in Sri Lanka’s 75th year of Independence, which is now in its 11th month.  We are pleased that the cabinet has approved two major pieces of legislation to establish a Commission for Truth, Harmony and Reconciliation of Sri Lanka and also to legally establish an Office for National Unity and Reconciliation. These are to be published as government gazette notifications to enable the general public and all interested parties to further submit opinions and proposals in this regard.

The civil society initiative undertaken by the Association of War Affected Women in bringing together an active section of the Tamil Diaspora along with a section of senior Buddhist monks is another positive development that can lay the groundwork for a political solution.  NPC sees this civil society initiative as a first step in bridging the divide between its extremes which can give rise to wider dialogue and deeper understanding.  We are pleased that the Diaspora members and Buddhist monks were able to agree on a joint set of principles necessary to resolve the conflict in an equitable and sustainable manner.  This set of principles was also shared with politicians in parliament and with all major religious clergy and met with their general consent which was also welcomed by members of the diplomatic community as they are universal values demonstrating equality and equity among communities.  There are some who oppose this initiative.  The National Peace Council calls on those holding opposing viewpoints to find ways and means of consolidating it for the common good of the country rather than focusing on their parochial and narrow political interests.

However, we note that on the ground, the large military presence in the North and East even nearly 15 years after the end of the war, and associated surveillance of the security arms of the state, cause unease among the people.   We also note issues of land being claimed for religious and farming reasons by those from outside the Northern and Eastern provinces, which is to the detriment of the people at the ground level.  As a priority the people need a government they can trust, one that will safeguard their land and ensure their personal safety and provide for them a government administration where they could use their language, freely. The provincial councils were meant to do this, and we call on the government to hold those elections without further delay so that people at the provincial level will be governed by those they voted for. As another year ends, a new one begins, we call on the government to address these problems on the ground and instill confidence in the people of the north and east that their economic and justice concerns will be met as an equal people of Sri Lanka.

The Law and Society Trust press briefing to discuss ‘The Budget and Education during the Time of Covid’

LST invited three academics to share their perspectives to inform the public. 

The pandemic has devastated Sri Lanka’s society and the economy. The Budget for 2022 drafted in the context of the pandemic finally recognizes the severity of the economic crisis as one of the worst in the history of the country and the Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech identified the systemic character of this crisis and the structural problems of the economy reaching back over the decades. While the diagnosis of the crisis is correct, the solutions put forward in the Budget are flawed and the priorities misplaced. 

The Government’s revenues in 2020 and 2021 are abysmally low and on the order of 9% of GDP mainly due to the tax cuts introduced soon after President Rajapaksa came to power. 

Indeed, Sri Lanka has comparatively spent very little on Covid-19 relief for the marginalised sections of society in 2020 compared to most countries; Sri Lanka’s COVID relief is lower than 0.5% of GDP. 

Dr. Ahilan Kadirgamar claims the Budget plans to raise revenue to 12.3% of GDP but the measures proposed are unconvincing, and it is uncertain if the proposed Budget proposals will be implemented at all. He was of the view that Sri Lanka should eventually target revenues above 25% of GDP and he advised that measures such as a wealth tax are needed to raise Government revenue during a time when incomes are falling.

Much of the Government spending is focused on infrastructure and populist measures of hand outs to rural constituencies. Neither are going to get the country out of the crisis. A country like Sri Lanka cannot stimulate itself out of the economic crisis through infrastructure spending. 

In the budget there are no measures to mobilise the rural economy with appropriate investment and programmes. For example, the crucial sectors of fisheries and livestock important for milk production have only been allocated Rs. 1 billion each.  In past years the imports for these sectors have been on the order of Rs. 40 billion (USD 200 million) and Rs. 60 billion (USD 200 million) respectively. These are foreign exchange expenditures that the country cannot afford today.

When it comes to the education sector both the diagnosis of the problem and the solutions are flawed. The Government is repeating past programs of trying to extract revenue through education by for example inviting foreign students and fee levying institutions. 

Dr. Kaushalya Perera noted that a large part of the government’s plan for the future seems to be based on current and expected loans and grants from the “bilateral and multilateral agencies”.

The Minister of Finance states in his maiden budget speech stated that the government works “closely” with these agencies. Primary to tertiary education is funded by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID), the Kuwait Fund, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), India, Saudi Arabia, the European Union through ERASMUS funds, Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) through primarily the Ministry of Education and indirectly through the State Ministry of Skills Development, Vocational Education, Research & Innovations as well as State Ministry of Women and Child Development, Pre-Schools & Primary Education, School Infrastructure & Education Services.

These are ongoing projects, lasting approximately 2-3 years more, and the total value is USD 250 million. Due to various issues both country internal and related to matters between donor agencies, the World Bank remains the main lender and is the driving force of policy in education in Sri Lanka. Therefore, our education policies have been and will continue to have an emphasis on what the World Bank considers important: technological advances, infrastructure development which is interpreted as what a better learning environment is, and on training to be a tech-savvy workforce. This is apparent in the budget documents, and the budget speech as well. When the government decides to fund education mainly through foreign investments, when the larger portion of it is in the form of loans, where the conditions are already set, there is no space to suddenly shift away and start thinking of the needs of the country at this point. 

Dr Sharmala Kumar noted considering the multiple crises that we face generally as well as with respect to education, these plans should then provide an answer or response to addressing these crises. 

A primary concern for local communities and families was that the state should provide education during the Covid period that is responsive to their daily concerns and provides them with a semblance of safety and security. As a result of the pandemic, families were faced with mounting financial worries and even the midday meals that some children relied on were no longer available. The social network that protected students when their home environment was less than ideal through teachers and schools was lost during the pandemic. Finally, the strain of the pandemic and the isolation caused by social distancing is associated with a range of mental health concerns for students and their families. 

The Pandemic also revealed the problems that chronic underfunding and disinvestment of education had created for students, families, and teachers. The momentum that was built and the wide support that the teachers’ trade union action garnered is evidence of this.  The pandemic highlighted the vast disparities in education and, more broadly, society. A majority of the students and many teachers were completely disengaged from the online delivery of teaching that had become the only national policy on education. UNICEF reports that we have over 75% of our population without access to the internet. It also revealed that the system was unable to respond to the needs of a society ravaged by a pandemic. The budget appears to suggest no significant or systematic response at all. What would have been appropriate is a transformation of education, drawing of the issues that have been highlighted by teachers, farmers, and the public in general, that integrates education to a national solution to the problems that face us in 2022.

ආචාර්ය අහිලන් කදිරගාමර් පවසන්නේ අයවැය මඟින් දළ දේශීය නිෂ්පාදිතයෙන් 12.3% දක්වා ආදායම ඉහළ නැංවීමට සැලසුම් කර ඇති නමුත් යෝජිත ක්‍රියාමාර්ග ඒත්තු ගැන්විය නොහැකි බවත්, යෝජිත අයවැය යෝජනා කිසිසේත් ක්‍රියාත්මක වන්නේද යන්න අවිනිශ්චිත බවත්ය. ශ්‍රී ලංකාව අවසානයේ දළ දේශීය නිෂ්පාදිතයෙන් 25%ට වැඩි ආදායමක් ඉලක්‌ක කළ යුතු බව ඔහුගේ අදහස වූ අතර ආදායම් පහත වැටෙන කාලයකදී රජයේ ආදායම ඉහළ නැංවීම සඳහා ධන බද්දක් වැනි ක්‍රියාමාර්ග අවශ්‍ය බව ඔහු උපදෙස් දුන්නේය.

රජයේ වියදම්වලින් වැඩි ප්‍රමාණයක් ග්‍රාමීය මැතිවරණ කොට්ඨාසවලට යටිතල පහසුකම් සහ ජනතාවාදී ක්‍රියාමාර්ග කෙරෙහි අවධානය යොමු කර ඇත.
ශ්‍රී ලංකාව වැනි රටකට යටිතල පහසුකම් වියදම් හරහා ආර්ථික අර්බුදයෙන් මිදිය නොහැක. ග්‍රාමීය ආර්ථිකය නිසි ආයෝජන සහ වැඩසටහන් සමඟ ඒකරාශී කිරීමේ ක්‍රියාමාර්ග අයවැයේ දක්නට නැත. උදාහරණයක් ලෙස කිරි නිෂ්පාදනය සඳහා වැදගත් වන ධීවර හා පශු සම්පත් යන තීරණාත්මක අංශ සඳහා වෙන් කර ඇත්තේ රු. බිලියන 1 බැගිනි. පසුගිය වසරවල මෙම අංශ සඳහා ආනයනය පිළිවෙලින් රු. බිලියන 40 (ඇමරිකානු ඩොලර් මිලියන 200) සහ රු. 60 බිලියන (ඇමරිකානු ඩොලර් මිලියන 200) ලෙස විය.

මේවා අද රටට දරාගත නොහැකි වියදම් බවට පත්ව ඇත. අධ්‍යාපන ක්‍ෂේත්‍රය සම්බන්ධයෙන් ගත් කල, ගැටලුව හඳුනා ගැනීම සහ විසඳුම් යන දෙපක්ෂයම දෝෂ සහිතය. උදාහරණයක් ලෙස විදේශීය සිසුන්ට ආරාධනා කිරීම සහ ගාස්තු අය කරන ආයතන මගින් අධ්‍යාපනය හරහා ආදායම් ලබා ගැනීමට උත්සාහ කිරීමේ අතීත වැඩසටහන් රජය නැවත නැවතත් කරමින් සිටී.

ආචාර්ය කෞෂල්‍ය පෙරේරා සඳහන් කළේ රජයේ අනාගත සැලැස්මේ විශාල කොටසක් දැනට පවතින සහ අපේක්ෂිත ණය සහ “ද්විපාර්ශ්වික සහ බහුපාර්ශ්වික නියෝජිතායතනවලින්” ලැබෙන ප්‍රදාන මත බව පෙනෙන බවයි. මුදල් අමාත්‍යවරයා සිය මංගල අයවැය කතාවේදී ප්‍රකාශ කළේ රජය මෙම ආයතන සමඟ සමීපව කටයුතු කරන බවයි.

ප්‍රාථමිකයේ සිට තෘතීයික අධ්‍යාපනය සඳහා අරමුදල් සපයනු ලබන්නේ ලෝක බැංකුව, ආසියානු සංවර්ධන බැංකුව, ජාත්‍යන්තර සංවර්ධනය සඳහා වන ඔපෙක් අරමුදල (OFID), කුවේට් අරමුදල, ජපාන ජාත්‍යන්තර සහයෝගිතා නියෝජිතායතනය (JICA), ජාත්‍යන්තර සංවර්ධනය සඳහා වූ එක්සත් ජනපද නියෝජිතායතනය (USAID), ඉන්දියාව, සෞදි අරාබිය, ERASMUS අරමුදල් හරහා යුරෝපා සංගමය, කොරියානු ජාත්‍යන්තර සහයෝගිතා නියෝජිතායතනය (KOICA) ප්‍රධාන වශයෙන් අධ්‍යාපන අමාත්‍යාංශය හරහා සහ වක්‍රව නිපුණතා සංවර්ධන, වෘත්තීය අධ්‍යාපන, පර්යේෂණ සහ නවෝත්පාදන රාජ්‍ය අමාත්‍යාංශය මෙන්ම කාන්තා හා ළමා සංවර්ධන රාජ්‍ය අමාත්‍යාංශය, පූර්ව -පාසල් සහ ප්‍රාථමික අධ්‍යාපනය, පාසල් යටිතල පහසුකම් සහ අධ්‍යාපන සේවා යන ආයතන මඟිනි.

මේවා දැනට ක්‍රියාත්මක ව්‍යාපෘති වන අතර, මේවා ආසන්න වශයෙන් වසර 2-3ක් පමණ පවතින අතර, මුළු වටිනාකම ඇමෙරිකානු ඩොලර් මිලියන 250 කි. රට අභ්‍යන්තර සහ පරිත්‍යාගශීලී ආයතන අතර ඇති විවිධ ගැටලු හේතුවෙන් ලෝක බැංකුව ප්‍රධාන ණය දෙන්නා ලෙස පවතින අතර ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ අධ්‍යාපනයේ ප්‍රතිපත්තිවල ගාමක බලවේගය වේ.

එබැවින්, අපගේ අධ්‍යාපන ප්‍රතිපත්ති ලෝක බැංකුව වැදගත් ලෙස සලකන දේ කෙරෙහි අවධාරණය කර ඇති අතර ඉදිරියටත් පවතිනු ඇත: තාක්‍ෂණික දියුණුව, වඩා හොඳ ඉගෙනුම් පරිසරයක් ලෙස අර්ථකථනය කරන යටිතල පහසුකම් සංවර්ධනය සහ තාක්‍ෂණික දැනුමැති ශ්‍රම බලකායක් වීමට පුහුණු කිරීම. අයවැය ලේඛනවල මෙන්ම අයවැය කතාවේ ද ඒ බව පෙනේ. අධ්‍යාපනයට ප්‍රධාන වශයෙන් විදේශ ආයෝජන හරහා අරමුදල් සැපයීමට රජය තීරණය කරන විට, එයින් වැඩි කොටසක් ණය වශයෙන් වන විට, දැනටමත් කොන්දේසි සකස් කර ඇති විට, හදිසියේම ඉවත් වී රටේ අවශ්‍යතා ගැන සිතීමට ඉඩක් නැත. මෙම කරුණ.

ආචාර්ය ෂර්මලා කුමාර් සඳහන් කළේ අප පොදුවේ මුහුණ දෙන බහුවිධ අර්බුද මෙන්ම අධ්‍යාපනය සම්බන්ධයෙන්ද සලකා බලන විට, මෙම සැලසුම් මෙම අර්බුදවලට විසඳුම් සෙවීමට පිළිතුරක් හෝ ප්‍රතිචාරයක් සැපයිය යුතු බවයි.

ප්‍රාදේශීය ප්‍රජාවන් සහ පවුල් සඳහා මූලික සැලකිල්ලක් වූයේ ඔවුන්ගේ දෛනික අවශ්‍යතාවලට ප්‍රතිචාර දක්වන සහ ඔවුන්ට ආරක්ෂාව සහ ආරක්ෂාව පිළිබඳ සමානත්වයක් ලබා දෙන අධ්‍යාපනය කොවිඩ් කාල සීමාව තුළ රජය විසින් ලබා දිය යුතු බවයි. වසංගතයේ ප්‍රතිඵලයක් වශයෙන්, පවුල් වැඩි වන මූල්‍ය කරදරවලට මුහුණ දුන් අතර සමහර දරුවන් යැපෙන දහවල් ආහාරය පවා තවදුරටත් ලබා ගත නොහැකි විය. සිසුන්ගේ නිවෙස් පරිසරය පරමාදර්ශයට වඩා අඩු වූ විට ගුරුවරුන් සහ පාසල් හරහා සිසුන් ආරක්ෂා කළ සමාජ ජාලය වසංගතය තුළ අහිමි විය.

අවසාන වශයෙන්, වසංගතය සහ සමාජ දුරස්ථභාවය නිසා ඇති වන හුදකලාව සිසුන්ට සහ ඔවුන්ගේ පවුල්වලට මානසික සෞඛ්‍ය ගැටලු රාශියක් සමඟ සම්බන්ධ වේ. මෙම වසංගතය මගින් සිසුන්, පවුල් සහ ගුරුවරුන් සඳහා අඩු අරමුදල් සැපයීම සහ අධ්‍යාපනය සඳහා ආයෝජනයේ ගැටළු ද අනාවරණය විය. ගොඩනැගුණු ගම්‍යතාව සහ ගුරු වෘත්තීය සමිති ක්‍රියාමාර්ගයට ලැබුණු පුළුල් සහයෝගය ඊට සාක්ෂියකි.

වසංගතය අධ්‍යාපනයේ සහ වඩාත් පුළුල් ලෙස සමාජයේ විශාල විෂමතා ඉස්මතු කළේය. සිසුන්ගෙන් බහුතරයක් සහ බොහෝ ගුරුවරු අධ්‍යාපනය පිළිබඳ එකම ජාතික ප්‍රතිපත්තිය බවට පත්ව තිබූ මාර්ගගත ඉගැන්වීම් බෙදා හැරීමෙන් සම්පූර්ණයෙන්ම විසන්ධි විය. UNICEF වාර්තා කරන්නේ අපේ ජනගහනයෙන් 75% කට වැඩි ප්‍රමාණයක් අන්තර්ජාල ප්‍රවේශය නොමැතිව සිටින බවයි.

වසංගතයකින් විනාශ වූ සමාජයක අවශ්‍යතාවලට ප්‍රතිචාර දැක්වීමට පද්ධතියට නොහැකි වූ බව ද එයින් හෙළි විය. අයවැය කිසිසේත් සැලකිය යුතු හෝ ක්‍රමානුකූල ප්‍රතිචාරයක් යෝජනා නොකරන බව පෙනේ. යෝග්‍ය වනුයේ 2022 දී අප මුහුණ දෙන ගැටලුවලට ජාතික විසඳුමක් සඳහා අධ්‍යාපනය ඒකාබද්ධ කරන ගුරුවරුන්, ගොවීන් සහ පොදුවේ මහජනතාව විසින් උද්දීපනය කරන ලද ප්‍රශ්න ඇඳීම, අධ්‍යාපනය පරිවර්තනය කිරීමකි.",1637381376,0,CSO Collective,2021-11-20T04:09:36.000Z

**************************************************************
முன் மொழியப்பட்ட “பயங்கரவாத எதிர்ப்பு சட்ட மூலத்தின் குறிப்பிட்ட சில விதிகள் அரசியல் அமைப்பை மீறுகின்றன என்றும், இது நடைமுறைப்படுத்தப் பட்டால்  அது மக்களிற்கு கடுமையான மற்றும் சீர் படுத்த முடியாத ரணங்களை ஏற்படுத்தும் என்றும் தீர்ப்பளிக்குமாறு கோரி ஜனவரி 22, 2024 அன்று சட்டம் மற்றும் சமூக நம்பிக்கை உச்ச நீதிமன்றத்தில் மனு ஒன்றைத் தாக்கல் செய்தது. 

இந்த சட்ட மூலம் பொதுவாக ஒரு தனி நபரின் மாற்ற முடியாத உரிமைகள் மற்றும் மக்களின் குறிப்பிட்ட சில உரிமைகளை மீறுகின்றது என்ற எண்ணத்தைக் கொண்டுள்ளது.

அரசியல் அமைப்பு மக்களின் இறையாண்மையையும் (சட்டப்பிரிவுக் கூறு 3), மக்களின் சட்டம் இயற்றும் அதிகாரங்களையும்  (சட்டப்பிரிவுக் கூறு 4 (அ)), மக்களின் நீதிமன்றம் சார்ந்த அதிகாரங்களையும் (சட்டப்பிரிவுக் கூறு (இ)) மற்றும் பல்வேறு அடிப்படை உரிமைகளையும் இந்த சட்ட மூலம் மீறுகின்றது.

இந்த சட்ட மூலம் பல உரிமைகளை மீறுகின்றது. குறிப்பாக, மக்களின் சிந்தனைக்கான உரிமை (சட்டப் பிரிவுக் கூறு 10), சித்திரவதைகளில் இருந்து விடுபடுவதற்கான உரிமை (சட்டப்பிரிவுக் கூறு 11) சமத்துவத்திற்கான உரிமை (சட்டப்பிரிவுக் கூறு 12 (1)),  எழுந்தமானமான / தன்னிச்சையான கைதுகளில் இருந்து விடுதலை (சட்டப்பிரிவுக் கூறு 13 (1)), கைது செய்யப்படுகின்ற சந்தர்ப்பத்தில் உரிய நடவடிக்கைக்கான உரிமை (சட்டப்பிரிவுக் கூறு 13 (2)), நியாயமான விசாரணைக்கான உரிமை (சட்டப்பிரிவுக் கூறு 13 (3)), மற்றும் நிரபராதி என கருதப்படுவதற்கான உரிமை (சட்டப்பிரிவுக் கூறு 13 (5)).

இந்த சட்ட மூலம் மக்களின் பேச்சு சுதந்திரம், ஒன்று கூடல்,  சங்கம் மற்றும் இயக்கத்திற்கான உரிமை, நம்பிக்கைகள் மற்றும் வழிபாட்டிற்கான சுதந்திரம், கலாச்சார சுதந்திரம், தொழில் மற்றும் வியாபாரம் மற்றும் உலாவுவதற்கும் வாழ்விடத்தை தெரிவு செய்வதற்குமான சுதந்தரம் ஆகியவற்றை குறை மதிப்பீடு செய்கின்றது. 

இந்த மனு “பாராளுமன்றம் அதன் சட்டமியற்றும் அதிகாரத்தை கைவிடவோ அல்லது அன்னியப் படுத்தவோ கூடாது” (சட்டப்பிரிவுக் கூறு 76 (1). மற்றும் அரசியலமைப்பிற்கு அமைய சட்டங்களை இயற்றப்பட  வேண்டும் என்று பாராளுமன்றத்திற்கு நினைவூட்டுகின்றது.

இந்த மனு பயங்கரவாதம் என்றால் என்ன என்பதனை தெளிவாக வரையறை செய்கின்றது. இதற்குள் பயங்கரவாதத்துடன் பெரியளவில் தொடர்புகள் அற்ற  சட்டத்திற்கு முரணான   பல்வேறு நடவடிக்கைகள் மற்றும் புறக்கணிப்புகளை உள்ளடக்குகின்றது. இது நிர்வாக தடுப்புக் காவல் மற்றும் நீதித் துறை குறை மதிப்பினை மேற்பார்வை செய்கின்றது. இது மிகையான பரந்த விசாரணை அதிகாரங்களையும் மற்றும் சந்தேக நபர்களிற்கு அபராதம் விதிக்க சட்டமா அதிபரிற்கு நியாயம் அற்ற அதிகாரத்தையும் வழங்குகின்றது. இது பயங்கரவாத அமைப்பு மற்றும் தடை செய்யப்பட்ட பிரதேசங்கள் என இடங்களை தடை செய்யவும் ஜனாதிபதிக்கு அதி விசேட அதிகாரத்தை வழங்குகின்றது. இந்த சட்ட மூலம் மனித உரிமைகள் பலவற்றை மீறுவதுடன் இது சர்வதேச தரத்திற்கு இணங்கவில்லை.

இந்த சட்ட மூலம் நடைமுறைப்படுத்தப் பட்டால் அது மக்கள் மற்றும் எதிர் கால சந்ததியினரின் அடிப்படை உரிமை மீறல்களிற்கும் மற்றும் இலங்கையின் ஜனநாயக கட்டமைப்பிற்கும் “கடுமையான மற்றும் சீர் படுத்த முடியாத” ரணங்களை ஏற்படுத்தும் என்பதை நாங்கள் மீண்டும் வலியுறுத்துகின்றோம்.",1706329214,0,Law & Society Trust,2024-01-27T04:20:14.000Z

Over the years they have built regional networks and like-minded women's circles spanning thousands of people and families. This is a beautiful network of impact and change.

On 22nd January 2024 the Law and Society Trust (LST) petitioned the Supreme Court to determine that specific provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Bill violate the constitution and if enacted will do “grave and irreparable injury” to the people.
LST maintains that provisions of the Bill violate in general the inalienable rights of persons as well as specific rights of citizens.
The Bill violates the sovereignty of the People (Article 3); the legislative powers of the People (Article 4 (a)); the judicial powers of the People (Article 4 (c)); and a range of fundamental rights protected by the Constitution. 

Specifically, the Bill violates the people’s rights to the freedom of thought (Article 10), freedom from torture (Article 11); the right to equality (Article 12(1)); freedom from arbitrary arrest (Article 13 (1), the right to due process when arrested (Article 13(2), the right to be heard at a fair trial (Article 13 (3)), and the right to the presumption of innocence (Article 13 (5)).

The Bill also undermines the rights of citizens to freedom of speech, assembly, association and movement, freedom of belief and worship, freedom of culture, of occupation and business and freedom to move and choose residence. 

The petition reminds Parliament that “it shall not abdicate or alienate its legislative powers “ (Article 76(1) and must pass laws that are aligned to the constitution.

This Bill has overbroad definitions of what constitutes terrorism. It includes a range of illegal acts and omissions which may have little to do with terrorism. It provides for administrative detentions and undermines judicial oversight.  It provides overly broad powers of investigative powers and empowers the Attorney General to unfairly cause suspects to bear penalties. It gives the President extraordinary powers to proscribe organisations as terrorist organisations, designate places as prohibited places. The Bill violates many human rights and  is not aligned with international standards. 

We reiterate that this Bill if enacted will do “grave and irreparable injury” to the fundamental rights of the people and future generations, and to the fabric of democracy in Sri Lanka.

3,"At the meeting between members of the Tamil Diaspora group, the Global Tamil Forum and the president, he had assured the group of his support to their efforts to promote peacebuilding and reconciliation. This assurance would give reassurance to those who are like-minded that their work has the blessings of the country’s highest political authority. However, there is no getting away from the need for the political leadership to put its shoulder to the wheel rather than leave it to others to perform the Sisyphean task of pushing the boulder up the mountain. The government needs to give the political leadership to set up the institutions of state power and construct methods of ensuring justice which are embedded in the law.

For the past three years the Tamil farmers and herdsmen in Batticaloa have been complaining that the grazing land on which their cattle find fodder are being taken over for cultivating corn by Sinhala settlers. It is said that the grazing land was allocated by the government in a cabinet decision in 2011. However, since 2020, Sinhala settlers from Polonnaruwa have been annexing the pasture for corn cultivation. The conflicting permissions have caused tensions. Former Vice Chancellor of Eastern University, Prof Thangamuthu Jayasingam who now practices a lawyer for the Tamil farmers has confirmed that more than 80 cattle have been stolen, slaughtered or electrocuted on the ground since the visit of the president to Batticaloa two months ago. The total loss is said to be around 160 cattle. He has stated that “This unjust situation runs amidst and despite the establishment of two police posts, around October 7, 2023, just before the visit by the Honorable President to Batticaloa, and his declaration on 8th October 2023, to provide justice to these people at Chenkaladi.”

A similar unsettled situation on the ground exists in the north as well where the president ordered an end to the takeover of land on the basis that ancient Buddhist archaeological remains have been discovered in various places. When the words of the President, the highest executive, are not met with deeds on the ground the people will invariably lose faith in the system. Further when the orders of the court of law also are not implemented, and the police fail to act, they lose faith entirely. It is in such situations that violence emerges. Words need to be followed by deeds, or the spirit of goodwill and reconciliation that is in the air will not bring a solution to the problems on Ground Zero. The gazetting of the grazing areas by a presidential directive as per the 2011 cabinet paper may be a start to reconcile.

This collaborative initiative with JA was spearheaded by IESC’s Diversity, Equity, Inclusivity, and Accessibility (DEIA) committee. 

The 3DE program transforms high school education into a dynamic, competency-based experience, fostering critical thinking and project-based learning by connecting students to real-life opportunities. The spirit of this program aligns with IESC DEIA initiatives by empowering diverse communities and imparting skills for success in the private sector. IESC volunteers provided support in two ways: 1. Volunteer business coaches helped teams of sophomore-year students think through real-world business cases by listening to and refining solution ideas, planning presentation content, and providing tips to enhance delivery skills; and 2. Volunteer business coaches observed the best presentations, critically evaluated solutions, offered constructive feedback, and selected the winning team. 

This initiative not only embodies IESC's commitment to community well-being through workforce development and growth but also contributes to inclusivity in education. IESC anticipates more opportunities to contribute to the DC-Maryland-Virginia community in 2024.",1705593675,0,IESC,2024-01-18T16:01:15.000Z

During his first visit to the Province, UN Resident Coordinator Marc-André Franche met with civil society partners, local authorities and UN field colleagues to discuss challenges facing the region, including matters pertaining to land, livelihoods, gender-based violence, accountability, and civic space for engagement.

Mr. Franche visited several UN-supported development initiatives aimed at improving the livelihoods of local communities. These initiatives, supported by the 🇱🇰 Sri Lanka SDG Fund, encompass efforts such as supporting local handloom production, housing development, enhancing local government service delivery, and supporting civil society organizations in addressing local challenges and human rights issues.

As challenges related to land, economic conditions, social cohesion and violence against women persist, highlighting the need for sustainable and inclusive solutions to foster trust and reconciliation in the region is crucial.

The United Nations in Sri Lanka remains committed to working alongside communities and partners in the region to forge these solutions to ensure a peaceful and prosperous future where no one is left behind.

An elementary and secondary school teacher by profession, Hajrija Čobo fights against corruption and the destruction of the environment as a representative of NGG Park prirode Trstionica i Boriva, an informal grassroots group of local activists. The defamation lawsuit directly targets her for speaking out against the mining company's activities. She has spoken out about water contamination, health problems posed by the polluted water, deforestation, habitat loss and unethical conduct. Despite receiving threats and attempts to silence her, Hajrija has kept carrying her peaceful defense of human rights.

📢Front Line Defenders calls on the Adriatic Metals BH d.o.o to cease their targeting of Hajrija, and immediately withdraw the lawsuit. We urge the authorities to dismiss the court proceedings, ensuring a safe environment for all human rights defenders.

8,"On 15 January, 2023 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Narges Mohammadi, was sentenced by Branch 26 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court to an extra fifteen-months in prison for “propaganda activities against the state” because of her human rights activities while incarcerated at Evin prison. 

The verdict (which was issued in her absence during a trial on 19 December 2023 and communicated to her two days ago) also imposes a two-year ban on residing in Tehran province, a two-year travel ban, a two-year prohibition on membership in social-political groups, and a two-year restriction on using a smartphone. These charges are the latest addition to a total of five convictions that she has faced since March 2021, which amount to over a decade in prison and 154 lashes, among other reprisals.

Front Line Defenders strongly condemns the continuous sentencing of Iranian WHRD Narges Mohammadi, who has long been unjustly imprisoned for her peaceful work in defense of justice and freedom for women in Iran. She has been arrested a total of 13 times, and her sentences amount to more than 30 years in prison and 154 lashes.  We urge Iranian authorities to quash the convictions and release her, as well as respect the basic rights of detained WHRDs in Iran.

Facing unjust charges for voicing concerns about women's human rights and the total abortion ban, Vanessa has endured a three-year-long legal battle, impacting her vital work defending human rights.

🌐 This landmark decision upholds Vanessa's freedom of expression and affirms the legitimacy of the efforts of all those defending women's rights, sexual and reproductive rights. While acknowledging this victory, we stand firm in demanding the Andorran authorities recognize the legitimacy of human rights work to ensure Vanessa and other defenders can advocate for safe and legal abortion without intimidation or fear of reprisals.

We urge the Andorran authorities to stop using defamation laws with the purpose of inhibiting criticism of public officials, to align with international human rights standards, and to ensure access to safe and legal abortion in Andorra, the only country in Europe with a total ban on abortion.

The agents chained the gate to his house with a padlock, detained him, and raided his residence without a court order, and then brought him to the police station where he was held for 6 hours. He was freed only after the trial of activist Laurinda Gouveia, which he was due to attend, had started, preventing him from acting as her legal representative. 

Zola is a well-known human rights lawyer based in Luanda, Angola, who works on assisting human rights defenders as well as communities whose rights have been violated. He has been documenting abuse and legal harassment in Luanda since the early 2000s.  He is the president of Angola's Observatory of Social Cohesion and Justice. 

This incident is not an isolated event. He has previously faced a number of incidents involving threats, harassment, physical assault, detention, and surveillance. Front Line Defenders is gravely concerned by the situation and calls on authorities to cease all forms of intimidation against him.

8,"Mohammad Habibi, human rights defender and spokesperson of the Teacher’s Trade Union of Tehran, is facing serious charges by the Shahryar Revolutionary Court in Iran for advocating for justice and protesting against the poisoning of school girls across the country.

Arrested multiple times since 2018, Mohammad has been a relentless advocate for human rights, leading to his termination as a teacher and continued harassment including physical violence, house raids and arbitrary detention. The latest charges of ""gathering and colluding against national security"" stem from his social media posts condemning the poisoning of school girls. The poisonings are believed to be in reprisal against women and young girls vindicating their rights not to conform to Iran’s discriminatory veiling rules and participation in protests.

Front Line Defenders urges Iranian authorities to drop all charges against him, conduct impartial investigations towards the allegations of physical assaults against him, and cease targeting him for his peaceful involvement in trade union activities and the defense of human rights.

In 2023, SRMW established the first pilot Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) Information Center, which will help facilitate skilled migration. The center is already serving as a pivotal space for conducting National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) assessments, strengthening opportunities for prospective or returned migrant workers to receive formal certification for technical skills.

He was detained since August 2021, when he was arrested and sentenced to prison in multiple cases for his human rights work. The cases relate to gathering to commemorate the victims of the downing of the Ukrainian airliner PS752 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corpse (which killed 176 civil passengers on board), for defending the right to health in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and for his advocacy against the death penalty.

These visits should have independent, safe and unfettered access standards that also guarantee confidential and unsupervised meetings with independent HRDs without reprisals.

➡️China should initiate a transparent and consultative legal reform process to review existing laws and regulations and align them to international human rights norms and standards.

➡️China should release all HRDs detained for their legitimate human rights work and cease all forms of intimidation, harassment, and undue restrictions against HRDs and their families, ensuring impartial investigations that hold perpetrators accountable.

As a means of getting men involved in a holistic empowerment effort for women, we have launched one of our strategic programs called the ‘’Dear Father Program’’ in partnership with the Rotary Club of Colombo Uptown and Department of Samurdhi Development. 

This is a national-level initiative launched to convert men as allies and to help men better integrate into the family fabric to fight against the emerging ‘’Fatherlessness (Noninvolvement of Fathers)’’ in our society.  This took us over 18 months of preparation time and the invaluable guidance provided by many government and UN organizations. A tri-party MOU signed on 8th November 2023 at the Department of Samurdhi Development, Battaramulla Head Office, marked the launching of this strategically important program. This is expected to make a positive impact on bridging the inequality index and to make a positive impact on Sri Lanka’s socio-economic development efforts.

It was truly an honor to witness the potential of so many young girls who are destined to become future leaders. I had the privilege of speaking with their parents who serve as their mentors and pillars of strength. 

I want to express my gratitude to the Visionary Chairman of Harcourts International School and to Hajara, another strong woman breaking many barriers. I also want to give a shoutout to the Old Girls Association and the dedicated teachers of the school. 

Empowering young girls is crucial to building a better world, and it was amazing to see so many people working towards this goal. Kudos to all those who are making a difference in the lives of these young girls.

2,"Violence against women is a crime. It’s a human rights violation. Given the current socio-economic situation, we see a rise in the numbers and incidents. We need to create awareness in society. 

Dependencies create vulnerabilities for women. The most common form of reported violence is controlling behavior (19.1%). This indicates less power for women in making decisions and putting them into action. The second most common is physical violence (18.9%). 

The Women’s Wellbeing survey (2019) also revealed that 1 in 5 women in Sri Lanka have experienced sexual and/or physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime; and 1 in 4 women have experienced sexual and/or physical violence since the age of 15 by a partner or non-partner.  Also, a study conducted by UNFPA in 2019, revealed that over 90% of SL women and girls have faced sexual harassment in public buses and trains at least once in their lifetime.  

In a society where women and girls are not safe, society itself will deteriorate. Therefore don’t look away. You must create awareness, say no, and take action to prevent this pandemic from destroying our society.

48,"The Women and Media Collective held a Policy Dialogue on Unpaid Care Work on 31st March 2023 at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo from 9 am to 1.00 pm.

The Women and Media Collective together with the Social Scientists’ Association carried out a research study on Unpaid Care Work in six districts in Sri Lanka during the period 2018 and 2020. Two research objectives informed this research. 

One was to assess, through a Time Use Survey, the time that is dedicated to activities that are carried out for the well-being of household members. The second research objective was to attempt to input an economic value to the time that is expended on these household care activities. 

The importance of valuing unpaid care work is key to recognizing the economic contribution of this work to the household and to the national economy on the one hand, and the need to review and expand the definitions used for what constitutes ‘work’ on the other.

The Policy Dialogue was conducted by Dr Sepali Kottegoda of the WMC, Dr. Pradeep Pieris of the Social Scientists’ Association and Prof. Dileni Gunewardena of the University of Peradeniya sharing the key findings of the research. Following which a lively discussion took place, moderated by Ms Sarala Emmanuel, with the assembled policy makers, government officials, Ministers and Researchers as to how to move forward in bringing forth actionable policy to recognise, reduse and redistribute Unpaid Care Work.

මේ අතර 2050 දක්වා වසරකට, 2050 වන විට ශුද්ධ ශුන්‍ය විමෝචනය කරා ළඟා වීමට හැකි වීම සඳහා, සංවර්ධනය වෙමින් පවතින රටවල අනුවර්තන මූල්‍ය අවශ්‍යතා  2030 දක්වා වාර්ෂිකව USD බිලියන 215-387 ලෙස ඇස්තමේන්තු කර ඇති බවත්, 2030 දක්වා වසරකට USD ට්‍රිලියන 4.3ක් පමණ පිරිසිදු බලශක්තිය සඳහා ආයෝජනය කිරීමට අවශ්‍ය බවත්,  ඉන්පසුව එය USD ට්‍රිලියන 5 දක්වා වැඩි කළ යුතු බවත් මෙම ලියවිල්ල අවධාරණය කරයි.

එහෙත් ලංකාව වැනි රටකට මෙලෙස බදු අයකිරීම වැන්නක් බරපතල කතිකාවතක් නිර්මානය කරනු ඇත. පොසිල ඉන්ධනවලින් ඉවත්වීම මෙහි ධනාත්මකභාවයක්  පෙන්නුම් කලත් වෙනත් එලෙස හුමාරුවීමේ බලශක්ති ප්‍රබවයන් තවමත්  ගෝලීය උශ්නත්වය වැඩි කිරීමට හා පරිසර දූශනයට හේතුකාරක වන ඒවාය. තවද අරමුදල් සැපයීම ලඟාකරගන්නට අසමත්ව ඇති බැවින් තවදුරටත් වැරදි විසදුම් මත හා සමාගම් තරකරන ඒවා බවට පත්වීම මෙයින් වලක්වනු නොහැකිය.  ලංකාව වැනි  ආර්තික ගැටලුවේ ගිලී ඇති රටවල් තවදුරටත් දේශගුන අරමුදල් සෙවීමේදී උගුල්වලට හසුවීම දිගින් දිගටම සිදුවනු ඇත.",1702908881,0,Centre For Environmental Justice,2023-12-18T14:14:41.000Z

2,"The Pekoe Trail, a long-distance walking trail in Sri Lanka, established under the Tourism Resilience Project, was recently featured in a National Geographic article. The article invites travelers to explore the Pekoe Trail – an existing network of footpaths created when the tea-growing industry began.  The trail passes through picturesque landscapes, remote villages, and tea estates, which will encourage travel into Sri Lanka’s less-visited interior. The Pekoe Trail grants hikers the chance to delve into Sri Lanka's tea estates located in the central highlands. The Tourism Resilience Project is funded by the European Union in collaboration with USAID and implemented by IESC.  

Ramli Raban, a trail guide featured in the article, explains that while the trail seems popular with foreign visitors, its impact could stretch further: “On the Pekoe Trail, you’re given the chance to understand people who live and look differently to you.

This exchange of knowledge and skills took place through national networks established between women activists and women farmers. At the first there was a discussion on the food security, nutrition food and organic food production while training was given on methods of preparing organic fertilizer, preparing organic pesticide, land preparation and methods of using traditional seeds. A small piece of land was provided from the plantation administration for collective farming by this women's organization headed by Jothi. The next stage of the event, seeding activities, was held on October 07. Currently, 20 women have planted traditional seeds together. The first harvest is to obtain seeds. While 09 types of traditional seeds have been provided, every woman will plant them in their gardens.

AYUBOWAN
GREETINGS FROM SLCDF

We believe you have stayed safe at home, a new experience. Coming back to “NORMAL” is going to be another experience. COVID-19 has made a distinct impact on all of US. While we slowly recover to the so called “normal” state, it will be good to recall what existed before the COVID breakdown, and what we experienced during the last two months of “lockdown”.

What is this “normal state” that we are seeking to achieve? COVID affected us directly and indirectly in many ways.

For many of us the normal activity that sustained our livelihood was affected. This would have been a great blow to our sustenance and survival, but despite the disruption we have managed the situation for two months. It is of no benefit to blame anybody or COVID, for the situation, as that will not rectify the situation. Instead it would be much more profitable to recall how we survived through the two months to ensure that we will not suffer again in the future.

If you managed through the donations of “well-wishers”, it would not continue after “normalization”. Could you go back to what you were doing before? Would that source be available? Many questions will be in your mind. Whatever it may be, the end result is definitely going to be different from what it was. It is this realization and how we will cope with this new situation that will be the most important aspect for the future.

COVID provided us direct experiences that are related to the environment, health and social concerns.

In the environment area, COVID showed us how bad our air quality had been. Across the world, including Sri Lanka, the air quality improved immensely. According to the National Building Research Authority in Sri Lanka, the quality change was 70% reduction in pollution. We have been breathing dirt, no wonder we were sick!!! The question is do we want to go back to that situation again, to breath poison???

It would have made you realize how “consumptive” you were. All the stuff that was consumed before the lock down was not available in quantity and in some situations totally. But we have survived. We have learnt through experience the whole concept of “SUSTAINABILITY” – living within the means of availability. If you recall seriously, you will realize that we did have all our NEEDS, but not many or any of our WANTS. The production levels decreased, the demands changed, it is true the producers would have been affected in term of their income, but that would have proportionately affected their consumptive life too. The bottom line every body survived at a LOWER LEVEL of PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION. Within the so called “foot print” of the planet, much healthier and with less future worries!

COVID has clearly taught us that we cannot continue to destroy nature or mess with it. Since 1940, there have been over 335 Emerging Infections of this nature, but fortunately they were not as devastating as COVID-19. All of these have been shown to have been because of our interference with nature. If we continue with the interference, along with the increasing human numbers, there definitely will be more “covids” to come. DO WE WANT THAT?

The global impact of the COVID, has shown us very clearly how even all the best hospital facilities cannot prevent death on entering a hospital, the stark social inequalities among the rich and poor. The poor, unemployed in the developed world came in vehicles for their free food rations. We provided it to the house hold, despite the numbers developing countries have shown a great resilience in comparison to the developed world. What is the secret???

There are many more similar experiences of the environment, while the social concerns are no different. The COVID has resurfaced our family, social obligations and country commitments. We have come to realize the importance of self-sustenance. We have come to recognize the need to grow our own food in the backyard. To share what we all have. These great practices were slowly fading off from our society, COVID has resurfaced them and their values recognized. We have to keep them and develop them further to ensure that we use them for the benefit of the society at large. We at SLCDF value these principles, as our future will be based on these principles.

The impact of the COVID-19 will not leave us for some time. It will hound us for a long time and affect our activities. This is the stark reality, the bitter truth. SLCDF will however, be with you, our efforts will treble, and continue. Our present response though meagre is done with good faith and within the present capacity. We hope to follow up with more in the future.

Follow all health advice and commit to be more environmentally friendly in the future. Stay safe, be safe.

13,"Nasim Soltanbeygi, a women's rights defender and journalist in Iran, has started serving a three-year and seven-month prison sentence, facing charges of ""gathering and colluding against national security"" and ""propaganda against the state."" This unjust verdict includes a two-year travel ban and a two-year ban on political or social group membership. Nasim's appeal, submitted in August, is now with Branch 36 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court.

Nasim has been a steadfast advocate for women's rights and freedom of expression, facing arrests and imprisonment for her activism since 2006. Despite being arbitrarily detained in the context of the “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests and released on bail earlier this year, the harassment continued, culminating in this severe sentence. 

Front Line Defenders strongly condemns this judicial harassment and believes her case is illustrative of Iran’s treatment of human rights defenders, where hundreds of human rights defenders have been arrested, charged and subjected to hefty prison sentences without adherence to due process or fair trials and excluded from general public amnesty.

1,"Senator Christopher Van Hollen, representing Maryland, embarked on a memorable journey to Sri Lanka, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the United States and Sri Lanka. During his visit to the Central Province, Senator Van Hollen, alongside the distinguished company of US Ambassador Julie Chung and USAID Mission Director Gabriel Grau, experienced first-hand the potential of The Pekoe Trail to activate new opportunities in sustainable tourism and economic development for upcountry communities. They walked stage one of the trail in Hantana Kandy, immersing themselves in the rich natural beauty and cultural heritage of Sri Lanka.  

The Pekoe Trail is made possible through funding from the European Union with additional support from USAID and is implemented by IESC’s Tourism Resilience in Sri Lanka Project.

காதல் என்பது, மானுட அனுபவத்தை வழிநடாத்துகின்ற அனைத்தையும் உள்ளடக்கிய ஓர் உணர்ச்சியாகும். இவ்வுலகில் பிறக்கின்ற நாம், ஏலவே பல ஆத்மாக்களுடன் பிணைக்கப்பட்டிருக்கின்றோம். எமது தொடக்கப் புள்ளியிலிருந்து நாம் எமது வாழ்வைப் பகிர்ந்துகொள்கின்றோம். ஆதலால், அன்பும் அக்கறையும் இயல்பாகவே அமையப்பெற்றவை. பிரதியுபகாரமாக எதுவும் கொடுக்கப்படாத நிலையிலும், எம்மை மிக அன்பாகக் கவனித்துக்கொள்பவர்களிடம் எமது அன்பை வெளிப்படுத்துவதற்காக இந்த காதலர் தினத்தில் நேரம் ஒதுக்குவோம். 

ஊதியமற்ற பராமரிப்புப் பணி என்பது, அன்பின் நிமித்தம் ஊற்றெடுக்கும் உழைப்பு; அதற்கான பெறுமானம் அளிக்கப்பட்டு, அது பாராட்டப்பட வேண்டும்.

European Union has approved budget allocation for 2,713 families to be provided with dry rations @ Rs.1,500 each (Total Rs.4,069,500) for Delthota and Kandawalai DSDs and Kandy and Kilinochchi districts respectively.

EU funded OCEAN project location, Kandawalai DSD was identified as one such area badly affected by the pandemic. SLCDF through the generous funding of the Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives provided 1,200 families belonging to 16 GNDs of the Kandawalai DSD with dry rations sufficient for two weeks at the cost of Rs.1500 (1200 families x Rs.1500/- = Rs.1.8 Million). These families earning 90% of their income from daily labour and agriculture and members of their families include persons with disabilities, Women headed households and some with many children, have now become helpless and dwindling in need.

We are grateful to the European Union for this generous contribution of Rs. 4.7 Million and thank the Kandawalai Divisional Secretary and staff, Civil Society Forum and SLCDF staff for their tireless support. We would also like to render our gratitude towards the entire of staff of the Kandawalai DS office for their hard work in identifying respective needy families, packing the goods and distributing them at this crucial time of need.

8,"We call for the immediate and unconditional release of Khurram Parvez, an HRD that has documented human rights abuses in Indian-administered Kashmir for years, and independent journalist, Irfan Mehraj, who are currently being detained in Rohini jail in India. Khurram has been in pre-trial detention for two years now, on politically motivated charges under an Indian counter-terror law (UAPA) that violates international human rights standards, while Irfan has been in pre-trial detention since March 2023, similarly on politically motivated charges. 

Indian authorities’ persecution of Khurram and Irfan is an emblematic part of their ongoing, systematic criminalization of civil society, and the defense of human rights, in Indian-administered Kashmir. These reprisals and judicial harassment that target them for their human rights work are occurring within a larger context of systematic, longstanding, grave human rights violations by Indian authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir and impunity for those violations.

We call for Indian authorities to adhere to international human rights laws and standards, end the criminalisation of human rights defenders and journalists; and ensure accountability for human rights violations committed by Indian forces in Indian-administered Kashmir.

-Civil Society Collective spends Rs. 18 million in July to provide relief:
Civil Society Collective urges the Government to implement the vaccination plan methodically-

 
Civil Society Collective for Covid-19 Response is a collective of civil society organizations that have come together to contribute to the national Covid-19 response efforts in Sri Lanka.

Relief Operation

In response to the Covid 19 pandemic, the Sri Lanka Civil Society Collective has launched an island-wide relief operation targeting people in need of relief throughout Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Civil Society Collective has already organized a large number of programs for the benefit of people in need throughout the island.  
 
During the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, the Civil Society Collective provided food and sanitary supplies to over 500 institutions such as children's homes, elders' homes, women's shelters, centers for persons with disabilities and rehabilitation centers. Therefore, the Collective arranged to distribute aid worth over Rs. 50 million island-wide during the first wave.

Current activities of the Civil Society Collective include providing food and sanitary supplies to poor families vulnerable to health risks in addition to providing the same to care centers and shelters; providing relief by means of telephone hotlines and support centers to women who have been victims of gender-based violence during the pandemic, and who are unable to access other assistance; and raising awareness of the impact of Covid-19 and safety precautions among vulnerable populations. 

Accordingly, the Civil Society Collective has implemented relief operations to support 9551 persons in 330 children's homes, elders' homes, women's shelters, centers for persons with disabilities and rehabilitation centers in 14 districts island-wide in the month of July. Rs. 5 million (Rs.5,200,488.00) was spent on dry rations and Rs. 13 million (Rs. 13,088,802.00) was spent on non-food assistance. Furthermore, we intend to increase the total amount spent on relief to Rs. 40 million by the end of this month. 

In addition to these direct interventions by us, other Civil Society Organizations operating at District level too have continued to provide relief and we have started to collect information regarding these efforts as well. Already, it has been confirmed that assistance exceeding Rs. two hundred and twenty one million (Rs. 221,464,760.00) was distributed last month by Civil Society Organizations operating at national and district levels at present. This still does not portray a complete picture of all their contributions and we intend to provide a more comprehensive image of these contributions in our next update.  

All relief efforts of the Collective are carried out in collaboration with the Government. 

Equality in vaccination: support sought from the international community.

Furthermore, in June, the Collective requested support from diplomatic missions in Sri Lanka to establish equality in vaccination and to provide humanitarian aid for vulnerable families.

This appeal from the CSO Collective has been delivered to Australian, Canadian, Indian, Bangladesh, Malaysian, Netherlands, Pakistan, Romanian, Chinese, Switzerland and British High Commissions and French, German, Italian, Japanese, Norway, Russian, USA Embassies as well as the Country office of the European Union, UN Resident Mission and WHO Country Office.

Health is a fundamental human right. It should not be decided on the basis of power or wealth. Since this disaster takes the form of a global pandemic, we must all unite to overcome this pandemic. Therefore, the Civil Society Collective has pointed out to the international community that vaccines must be distributed among all countries, and that all nations must stand united and collaborate on a long term basis in order to triumph over this pandemic. 

Scientific framework necessary for vaccination drive 

Furthermore, the CSO Collective remains vigilant about the vaccination drive implemented in Sri Lanka.

From time to time, news stories about irregularities in the vaccination programme can be heard. Political interventions too can be seen in the vaccination process. However, the vaccination drive appears to be running a bit more systematically in the past two weeks. The Civil Society Collective expects that vaccination will continue in a systematic and scientific manner. 

Furthermore, the Collective calls upon the Government;
to provide sufficient vaccination for people and to keep the people constantly updated regarding its plans;
to publicize the plan submitted by the government to WHO to receive and administer vaccines donated through the global vaccination donation programme;
to update the current vaccination plan and develop a comprehensive vaccination strategy with the leadership of relevant medical and public health experts;
to ensure that the plan is transparent regarding criteria used for prioritizing districts, divisions and villages and that the public is made aware of it;
to ensure that a scientific consensus is available regarding how people are prioritised when there is a scarcity of vaccines, and to pay particular attention to the at-risk groups;
to ensure that accessibility issues are taken into consideration and special vaccination schemes are put in place for the elderly, pregnant women and persons with special needs (disability);
to formulate a comprehensive communication strategy to ensure that vaccine-related information reaches the public evenly. Utilize television channels, radio channels, newspapers, sms services in Sinhala and Tamil to ensure that comprehensive information on the place and time of vaccination reaches the public;
to conduct public awareness programmes on the importance of vaccination and promptly respond to any misinformation and/or disinformation; 
to increase the number of PCR tests carried out daily as this is instrumental in stemming the spread of the virus, and also to expedite the results of PCR tests as this is useful to control the number of new patients and to minimize the community from being exposed to patients; and
to take leadership in eradicating Covid-19 from Sri Lanka while protecting the most vulnerable groups in society.

Civil Society Collective for Covid-19 Response  
076 807 96 99

The Civil Society Collective for COVID Response has been in operation since mid-May 2021
The Civil Society Collective has received 546 requests from 276 Children’s Homes, 208 Elder’s Homes, 4 Women’s Shelters, 6 Probation Homes, 32 Care Homes for People Living With Disability (PLWD), 9 groups of Vulnerable/low-income families and 11 other requests from plantation pre-school teachers, sex workers, transgender persons, COVID-19 intermediate care centres, rehabilitation centres, kidney patients etc., across 22 districts, as at 07th July, 2021. 

These requests include 2,871 men and 4,107 women in care homes and 2,753 boys and 4,139 girls in childrens’ care facilities. All together the requests for assistance we have received to date will cover 13,870 people.

Of these 546 requests, we have responded to 173 food related requests to date and are well into the process of responding to the rest. We have in our response so far, covered 60 children’s homes 58 Elders Homes, 7 care homes for PLWD, 5 probation centers and 1 women’s shelter across 14 districts. In addition, we have also responded to requests from 164 vulnerable families from Galle, Gampaha and Kandy. Dry rations have been provided to 3,243 individuals across 10 districts, amounting to Rs. 5,200,488.01.
There has also been several requests for basic hygiene items and safety products from the centers including for masks, sanitizers, thermometers. In response, to date Non Food Relief Items (NFRIs) have been provided to 9,551 individuals from 330 centres (includes Children’s Homes, Elder’s Homes, Women’s Shelters, Probation Homes) across 14 districts, amounting to Rs. 13,088,802.
We are in the process of responding to the balance requests and hope to complete them within this month.
All put together we have so far responded to 537 centers in 22 districts and other vulnerable groups covering 164 people. We hope to have delivered assistance worth of at least 40 million rupees by the end of this intervention.
In addition to our direct intervention we also would like to highlight the work of other civil society organisations - particularly those operating at the district level. We have begun collecting that information as well, and have found that a number of civil society organisations (CSOs), working at both the district and national levels, have stepped up to respond to this crisis. We have so far collected information from across the districts which indicate that around Rs. 221,464,760.22 million worth of assistance has been delivered in the last month by civil society groups. This is only a partial figure, and we hope to collate the contribution by NGOs and other civil society groups more fully and present in our next update.",1625759427,0,CSO Collective,2021-07-08T15:50:27.000Z

At a seminar held last month, IESC shared the financial viability and profitability of production models promoted by MOD based on farm output levels (i.e.., 45 to 100-plus liters of milk per day). The 100L model is recommended as the ideal commercial model for sustainable dairy businesses, as farmers who produce 100L or more per day are more likely to be able to generate sufficient income and make their farms a sustainable commercial model. This will also reduce their dependence on other incomes and subsidies. The financial analysis also suggested methods to make farms more cost effective to improve productivity, focusing on feed quality, herd composition, management of cows, maintenance and monitoring of accounts, energy efficiency (e.g., investing in bio-gas units and solar power), and procurement of feed in bulk, often shared between a group of farmers to save on costs.",1694700088,0,IESC,2023-09-14T14:01:28.000Z

1933 වසරේදී බලපිටිය වැල්ලබඩ ග‍්‍රාමයේ දරුවන් සය දෙනෙකුගෙන් යුත් පවුලක තුන්වෙනි දරුවා ලෙස වික‍්‍රම ඩල්සි ද සිල්වා උපත ලැබීය. ගාල්ල රේවත මහ විදුහලෙන් අධ්‍යාපනය හැදෑරූ ඇය පසුව මහරගම ගුරු අභ්‍යාස විද්‍යාලයට ඇතුල් විය. 1953 වසරේදී ඉංග‍්‍රීසි උප ගුරුවරියක් ලෙස කෑගල්ල අරන්දර බෞද්ධ මිශ‍්‍ර පාසලට මුල්ම පත්වීම ලැබූ ඇය 1958 වසරේදී කොළඹ විශ්ව විද්‍යාලයෙන් දේශපාලන විද්‍යාව පිළිබඳ බාහිර උපාධිධාරිනියකි. වසර 31ක් ගුරුසේවයේ නිරතව සිට විශ‍්‍රාමගත් ඇය, ඇයගේ සම්පූර්ණ කාලය වැය කළේ සමාජ සේවා හා දේශපාලන කටයුතු වෙනුවෙනි.

සහන සැලසීමේ ක්‍රියාන්විතය

කොවිඩ් 19 ව්‍යසනය අභිමුව ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ සිවිල් සංවිධාන සාමූහිකය විසින් ශ්‍රී ලංකාව පුරා සහන අවැසි ජනතාව ඉලක්ක කරගනිමින් දීපව්‍යාප්ත සහන සැලසීමේ ක්‍රියාන්විතයක් අරඹා ඇත. ඒ අනුව සිවිල් සංවිධාන සාමූහිකය මේ වන විටත් විශාල වැටසටහන්  ප්‍රමාණයක් දිවයින පුරා සහන අවැසි ජනතාව වෙනුවෙන් සංවිධානය කර ඇත. 

2020 දී වසංගතයේ පළමු රැල්ලේදී සිවිල්  සමාජ සාමූහිකය විසින් ළමා නිවාස, වැඩිහිටි නිවාස, කාන්තා සුරැකුම් මධ්‍යස්ථාන, ආබාධිත මධ්‍යස්ථාන සහ පුනරුත්තාපන මධ්‍යස්ථාන, 500කට අධික ප්‍රමාණයකට ආහාර සහ සනීපාරක්ෂක ද්‍රව්‍ය සපයන ලදී. ඒ අනුව පළමු රැල්ලේදී රුපියල් මිලියන 50 කට අධික සහනාධාර දිවයින පුරා බෙදා දීමට සිවිල් සංවිධාන එකමුතුව කටයුතු කරන ලදී.

මේ වන විට රැඳවුම් මධ්‍යස්ථාන සහ සුරැකුම් මධ්‍යස්ථාන හැරුණු විට කොවිඩ් -19 හේතුවෙන් පීඩාවට පත් දුප්පත් හා සෞඛ්‍ය අවදානමට ලක්විය හැකි පවුල් සඳහා ආහාර සහ සනීපාරක්ෂක ද්‍රව්‍ය ලබා දීම, වසංගතය තුළ ස්ත්‍රී පුරුෂ සමාජභාවය මත පදනම් වූ හිංසනයන්ට ගොදුරු වූ සහ වෙනත් ආධාර ලබා ගැනීමට නොහැකි වූ කාන්තාවන්ට දුරකථන සේවාවන් හා මධ්‍යස්ථාන හරහා සහන සැලසීම, අවධානමට ලක්විය හැකි ප්‍රජාවන්ට කොවිඩ් -19 බලපෑම පිළිබඳ දැනුවත්භාවය සහ ආරක්ෂක පියවර පිළිබඳව දැනුම් දීම ද සිදුකරනු ලබයි.

பலப்பிட்டி வெல்லபட எனும் கிராமத்தில் ஆறு பிள்ளைகளைக்கொண்ட ஒரு குடும்பத்தில் மூன்றாவது பிள்ளையாக 1933 ஆம் ஆண்டு விக்கிரம டல்சி டி சில்வா பிறந்தார்.  காலி ரேவத்த மகா வித்தியாலயத்தில் கல்வி கற்ற அவர், பின்னர் மஹரகம ஆசிரியர் பயிற்சிக்கல்லூரியில் சேர்ந்தார். 

1953 ஆம் ஆண்டில் ஆங்கிலப் பாட துணை ஆசிரியராக கேகாலை அரந்தர பௌத்த கலவன் பாடசாலைக்கு முதல் நியமனம்பெற்றுச் சென்ற அவர், 1958 ஆம் ஆண்டில் கொழும்புப் பல்கலைக்கழகத்தின் அரசியல் விஞ்ஞான வெளிவாரிப் பட்டதாரியுமாவார். 31 வருடங்கள் ஆசிரியர் சேவையில் ஈடுபட்டு ஓய்வுபெற்ற அவர், தனது வாழ்நாள் முழுவதையும் சமூக சேவைகள் செய்வதிலும் அரசியல் செயற்பாடுகளில் ஈடுபடுவதிலும் கழித்தார்.
 
பாடசாலை செல்லும் காலம்முதலே புரட்சிகர சிந்தனைகளைக் கொண்டிருந்தார். அநியாயங்களுக்கு எதிராகவும் அநீதிகளுக்கு எதிராகவும் தொடர்ச்சியாகப் போராடிய அவர், 1953 ஆம் ஆண்டு நடைபெற்ற பாரிய ஹர்த்தாலின் போது ஏனைய பெண்களையும் ஒன்றுதிரட்டி ஒத்துழைத்தார். ஸ்ரீ லங்கா மக்கள் கட்சியின் ஆரம்ப உறுப்பினர்களுள் ஒருவரான அவர், அக்கட்சியின் பெண்கள் சம்மேளனத்தின் ஆரம்ப செயலாளராவார். பெண்கள் சம்மேளனத்தின் தலைவராகக் கடமையாற்றிய அவர், கட்சியின் பல பதவிகளை வகித்துள்ளார். காலஞ்சென்ற வர்த்தகக் கூட்டுறவு மற்றும் உணவு பிரதி அமைச்சர் வை.பி.டி. சில்வா அவர்களின் மனைவியான அவர், நான்கு பிள்ளைகளின் அன்னையுமாவார்.

இனங்களுக்கிடையேயான சமாதானத்துக்காக அவரால் மேற்கொள்ளப்பட்ட அர்ப்பணிப்புக்களுக்காக 2005 ஆம் ஆண்டின் “அமைதிக்கான நோபல்” பரிசுக்காக 150 நாடுகளால் பெயரிடப்பட்ட ஆயிரம் (1000) பெண்களுள் ஒருவராகுவதற்கான வாய்ப்புக் கிடைத்தது. அதேபோல, பொலிஸாரின் தாக்குதல்களுக்கு உள்ளாகிக் காயப்படுவதற்கும் கைதுசெய்யப்படுவதற்கும் அவரின் சமூக அரசியல் வாழ்வில் சந்தர்ப்பங்கள் அமைந்தன. அவரது இத்தகைய சமூகச் செயற்பணிகளுக்காக உள்நாட்டு வெளிநாட்டு விருதுகள் பலவற்றைப் பெற்றுள்ளார். 

1999 - 2004 ஆம் ஆண்டு காலப்பகுதியினுள் பெண்கள் மற்றும் ஊடகக் கூட்டமைப்பிலும் நிகழ்ச்சித்திட்ட உத்தியோகத்தராக பணியாற்றிய அவர், பெண்கள் உரிமைகள் தொடர்பாக கிராமிய மட்டத்தில் அறிவுறுத்தி பெண்களை வலுவூட்டினார்.
 இலங்கையின் தேசிய வலையமைப்பான இலங்கையின் தாய்மாரும் புதல்வியரும் அமைப்பினதும் ஆரம்ப செயற்பாட்டு உறுப்பினர் ஒருவராவார்.“அமைதிக்கும் சுதந்திரத்துக்குமான பெண்களின் சர்வதேசக் கூட்டமைப்பின் (WILPF- Women's International League for Peace and Freedom) துணைத்தலைவியாக இரண்டு தடவைகள் செயலாற்றிய அவர், இதுநாள்வரை உலக தொழிற்சங்க சம்மேளனத்தின் துணைத் தலைவியாகவும் உலக சோசலிச பெண்கள் கூட்டமைப்பின் இலங்கையைப் பிரதிநிதித்துவப்படுத்தும் துணைத் தலைவியாகவும் உள்ளார்.

சிறிதுகாலம் நோய்வாய்ப்பட்டிருந்து வாழ்க்கையிலிருந்து விடைபெற்று திடீரென மீளாத்தூக்கத்தை அரவணைத்துக்கொண்ட அன்புள்ள “டல்சி சகோதரி” உங்களது துயில் அமைதியானதாக அமையட்டும் எனப் பிரார்த்திக்கின்றோம்.

7,"Front Line Defenders joins the Martin Ennals Foundation in condemning the harassment of WHRD Soltan Achilova and her daughter by government authorities at Ashgabat airport a few days ago where a customs official took their passports, wet them with a damp rag and declared them to be ruined, obstructing their traveling to Geneva where Soltan would feature as a keynote speaker at the University of Geneva’s Human Rights Week 2023.

Soltan's pictures of daily life are one of the few sources of documentation of human rights violations occurring in this most secretive nation. Her decade-long reporting and documentation of land grabs and forced evictions of local citizens was recognized by the Martin Ennals Award in 2021.

The WHRD believes she was not allowed to leave the country because of the authorities’ fear that negative information might be heard during the Human Rights week in Geneva. Yet, the obstruction from travel of an internationally recognized human rights defender is more striking evidence of the lack of freedoms in the country.  The silencing of Soltan and fellow journalists must stop. We renew calls for Turkmenistan to fully implement their human rights obligations and stop the silencing of human rights defenders.

6,"Oral statement delivered by the President of the United Federation of Labor attorney at Law Swasthika Arulingam On behalf of FORUM-ASIA during the 54th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council's Interactive dialogue on the report of OHCHR on promoting reconciliation, accountability, and human rights in Sri Lanka

- Quote in text - 

""The High Commissioner's Report gives a glimpse behind the facade put up to cover the deepening impunity, systematic repression of dissent, continuing violation of human rights in war-affected regions, and deepening economic inequalities in the country. Nearly 15 years after the end of the war, victims continue to wait for justice. The recent proposal of a Truth and Reconciliation mechanism, like successive commissions set up by the Government, appears to be designed to shield those implicated in war crimes and crimes against humanity, from criminal accountability, whilst keeping the Council and international community distracted. Similarly, the failure to credibly investigate the Easter Sunday bombings, including recent revelations about the complicity of the State security apparatus, leaves little room for public confidence in domestic mechanisms. Furthermore, the continued harassment of human rights defenders, activists, as well as Tamils and Muslims and families of disappeared and others in the North and the East, shows the Government's lack of commitment to systematic reforms demanded by protestors. This is demonstrated by the proposal to supposedly reform the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act through equally draconian laws. In the absence of accountability through domestic mechanisms, the Council remains an important avenue of hope and justice for victims of past atrocities and successive Governments. Therefore, the Council must strengthen and expand the accountability project, as well as the monitoring and reporting mandates of the country."" -

11,"Last week, Babul Hossain, General Secretary of Bangladesh Garment Workers Solidarity (BGWS), was arrested on false charges of inciting violence and vandalising vehicles during protests for minimum wage hikes. He was arrested after going missing the night before while travelling to meet with the families of those who had suffered violence at the hands of the police during “ready-made garment” (RMG) workers' protests.

The attack on this HRD who fights for the rights of garment workers in Bangladesh, organising protests and demanding improved labour laws, is the latest in a series of severe violations and reprisals faced by human rights defenders participating in the labour rights movement and seeking to raise awareness about the human rights situation of RMG workers in Bangladesh.

We urge the authorities in Bangladesh to immediately and unconditionally release Babul Hossain, as we believe these charges are a way of targeting him for his work in defence of labour rights for workers in the country.

The year was 2013 when Madushka, a seemingly ordinary young man, was kidnapped by a group of unknown individuals. The motive behind his abduction remains shrouded in mystery to this day. No one knows whether he is alive or dead, and this uncertainty has cast a long shadow over his family, especially his wife, Mayuri.

For a decade, Mayuri has been on a relentless quest to uncover the truth about her husband's disappearance. Her determination to find answers has led her on a tumultuous journey, marked by trips to Colombo and vigils that have illuminated the night in Galleface. Each time, she has pleaded for justice, hoping that someone, somewhere, might hold the key to the mystery that has shattered her family.

Yesterday was a pivotal day in Mayuri's journey for justice. She has decided to take her plea to the international stage by visiting the United Nations office in Colombo. Accompanied by her children and a small group of dedicated supporters, Mayuri arrived at the UN office with a written request in hand, seeking global attention to her family's plight.

Ravi, who has a 20-year history of defending landmark human rights cases, including issues of the death penalty, freedom of expression, and access to legal representation, continues to be judicially harassed for his work. 

The High Court of Singapore found M. Ravi liable for nine instances of contempt, spanning both State Courts and the High Court, all occurring in November 2021. This sentencing comes after a five-year suspension from practice  order issued earlier in March 2023 for making ""grave and baseless accusations of improper conduct"" against the Attorney-General of Singapore, limiting his ability to carry out his crucial work as a human rights lawyer in defense of human rights.

We strongly condemn this sentencing and the suspension order against M. Ravi and believe he is being targeted for his human rights work. We urge Singaporean authorities to reverse these decisions immediately, and ensure human rights defenders can continue their essential work without fear of reprisal.

However, she was banned from attending her own hearing for refusing to wear the mandatory hijab. This marks the seventh time she's faced new charges while in detention since September 2022. Mohammadi has been a tireless advocate for human rights, and was recently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight against oppression of women in Iran and her promotion of human rights. ✊🕊️

These charges come days after she ended her hunger srike after being transferred to the hospital, which she had started as a protest against neglectful medical care and the mandatory hijab rule for the women prisoners. Despite her continuous judicial harassment, she persists in her refusal to recognize revolutionary courts and discriminatory veiling rules.

We stand in solidarity with Narges Mohammadi and urge Iranian authorities to drop the unjust charges immediately which are a way of targeting her for her work in defence of human rights.

7,"Prominent human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh's request for bail in relation to her arrest on 29 October, was rejected a few days ago. She was arrested and beaten by police with taser batons along with 23 other women (most of whom have been granted bail) at Armita Geravand's funeral, an Iranian teenage girl who fell into a coma after she was allegedly assaulted by the country’s morality police for not wearing a headscarf. 

She was charged with “disturbing the public order” and “disobeying police order”, and transferred to Qrachak prison where she has been held since. Her lawyer has announced that additional charges of “gathering and colluding against the national security” and “propaganda activities against state” have also been arbitrarily levelled against her, amounting to an utter violation of due process. Additionally, while in detention in Qarchak prison, she received a summons from Branch 1097 of Ershad Judicial Complex. It is still unclear what these most recent charges relate to, but it speculated that it might relate to her refusal to wear her obligatory hijab during the funeral of Armita Geravand.

Front Line Defenders is extremely worried about her continuous judicial harassment. We urge authorities in Iran to immediately and unconditionally release WHRD Nasrin Sotoudeh and quash the convictions against her.

282,"The Search for Answers : Mayuri's Quest for Justice.

In a country with a rich history and culture, there lies a story that has haunted one family for a decade. The story begins ten years ago when a young man named Madushka was abruptly taken away by unidentified individuals in a white van, leaving behind a trail of questions that still linger unanswered.

The year was 2013 when Madushka, a seemingly ordinary young man, was kidnapped by a group of unknown individuals. The motive behind his abduction remains shrouded in mystery to this day. No one knows whether he is alive or dead, and this uncertainty has cast a long shadow over his family, especially his wife, Mayuri.

For a decade, Mayuri has been on a relentless quest to uncover the truth about her husband's disappearance. Her determination to find answers has led her on a tumultuous journey, marked by trips to Colombo and vigils that have illuminated the night in Galleface. Each time, she has pleaded for justice, hoping that someone, somewhere, might hold the key to the mystery that has shattered her family.

Madushka's children, who were mere infants when their father was taken from them, have now grown into young adults. They too seek to understand what happened to their beloved father. Their innocence lost, they yearn for closure and the chance to piece together the puzzle of their family's shattered life.

Mayuri's Bold Step to the United Nations

Today is a pivotal day in Mayuri's journey for justice. She has decided to take her plea to the international stage by visiting the United Nations office in Colombo. Accompanied by her children and a small group of dedicated supporters, Mayuri arrives at the UN office with a written request in hand, seeking global attention to her family's plight.

A Peaceful Gathering Amidst Heavy Security

Mayuri's approach is peaceful and devoid of protests or confrontations. She and her supporters stand silently in front of the UN Office, holding posters and banners that beseech for justice. Yet, the contrast is stark as a substantial police presence, numbering at least 150 officers, surrounds them, reflecting a fear of the citizens they are meant to protect.

Mayuri's story continues to unfold, a testament to the unyielding spirit of one woman's pursuit of answers, justice, and the restoration of her family's shattered life.

8,"Leanid Sudalenka, a prominent human rights defender, lawyer, and and advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in Belarus, is facing another potential conviction of up to six years in prison, after being targeted with trumped up criminal charges related to ""facilitating extremist activity."" 

Previously, Belarusian authorities labeled his organization, the Homel branch of the Human Rights Centre Viasna, as extremist, putting all those associated with it at risk of targeting and judicial harassment. Sudalenka believes his outspokenness about his past as a political prisoner and the harsh conditions he endured may have also triggered this new case. 

Front Line Defenders believes that he is being targeted as retaliation for his continued human rights work in a state-orchestrated attempt to silence him. Such targeting is a part of the systematic attack against HRDs and organizations in Belarus, ongoing since the August 2020 presidential elections and mass protests that erupted after the election events.

1,"""Over three decades of unwavering dedication on this estate, starting in 1990 under the stewardship of Nirmala Weerasamy, yet the promises of our rightful benefits remain unfulfilled. We were denied our due allocations of EPF/ETF under her watch. Even in 2015, when the ownership changed hands, the plight of us workers persisted. The new owner failed to honor our entitlements to EPF/ETF and gratuity.

Through the years, our struggles have gone unnoticed and unheard. But today, we stand united to shed light on the injustices we have faced for so long. It's disheartening to admit that the problems persist, even as we work tirelessly to uphold the estate's operations.

In recent times, we have received three letters, each a stark reminder of our precarious situation. The latest letter received just days ago, warns us to return to work within 15 days or face eviction from our homes.

We, the workers of this estate, share this not as a plea for sympathy, but as a call for justice. Our years of hard work and dedication deserve more than empty promises. We strive not just for ourselves, but for the principle that every worker deserves fair treatment and the fulfillment of their rights.

12,"26 year old woman human rights defender Bahjaa Abdelaa Abdelaa was shot and killed by an unidentified gunman at a funeral in Nyala, South Darfur, one week ago. Months before, she had reported to Front Line Defenders that she had been receiving death threats due to her human rights work. She was a member of the Women Revolutionary group,  and Darfur Collation of Women Human Rights Defenders (TMD), where she worked for women’s rights, gender equality, social justice and support to victims of rape and sexual violence. Despite the threats, she refused to relocate to continue to take care of her mother, who has a disablity. 

Since the outbreak of the armed conflict in April 2023 in Khartoum and the spread of militant groups in Darfur, human rights defenders have been victims of targeted threats and killings for their peaceful human rights work. 

Front Line Defenders condemns the killing of WHRD Bahjaa Abdelaa Abdelaa and all other victims of targeted threats and killings as a result of their legitimate human rights work.

The nomination process is open for anyone to submit a nomination of a human rights defender, collective, organisation or community working on any human rights issue and facing significant risk due to their work or operating in an environment that itself is characterised as insecure.

At the same time, the Award should not bring additional risk for which the HRD is not prepared. In addition to the Award, winners will receive:

- a modest financial prize;
- a security grant to improve their security measures;
- collaboration with Front Line Defenders for media work in recognition of the Award;
 - advocacy by Front Line Defenders related to the Award and the work of the winners;
- an event co-organized by the HRD, local partners and Front Line Defenders to give visibility to the Award in the winners’ countries (as determined and guided by the winners);
-the Global Laureates will attend a ceremony in Dublin at a date to be determined;
-ongoing security consultation with Front Line Defenders

Today (02/11/2023) CEJ held a stakeholder discussion on ""Commitment of  Sri Lanka for an ambitious global Plastic Treaty"" with the participation of representatives from government agencies including the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Industries, Central Environmental Authority, Marine Environment Protection Authority, Sri Lanka customs and private entities such as Chamber of Commerce, Institute of packaging, Plastic and Rubber Institute, as well as NGOs and media. 

The discussion was on understanding the zero draft of the Global Plastics Treaty,  the INC process, the zero draft outline, demands of civil society organizations on the Global Plastics Treaty, CEA's position on the zero draft, and hearing from other stakeholders. The packaging institute clearly expressed their objection to bringing bans highlighting their need, despite the clarification of CEJ on gaps in existing facilities as well as health and environmental concerns. However, it was explained that, at this stage, what is important is to select the options in the treaty that we as a country prefer to go forward with. The participants agreed to forward these suggestions to the government representatives attending the INC discussions in Kenya this month.

1,"International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism 2022: Remembering and honoring the victims obligates us to do more to provide for a safer, better tomorrow. 

- By Sakunthala kadirgamar - 

The 21st of August is The International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism.  It is the day to remember the suffering of its victims, their families, and their communities. Even as we remember past victims, we must surely strive to ensure that there will not be more victims in the future too.
Terrorism is the calculated use of violence to create a general climate of fear in society and bring about a particular political objective. Terrorism has inflicted horrors on people in Sri Lanka and across the world. Terrorism is driven by right-wing and left-wing ideologies, colonialists and nationalists and religious groups, revolutionaries, and even state institutions such as armies, intelligence services, and the police.  This is a description of reality, a statement of fact. Irrespective of the perpetrator's ideology or place in society – their use of fear tactics and violence strikes terror in the heart of the victims and leads to deaths, injuries, and destruction of property. The victims of terrorism are the softest targets – ordinary, unarmed, and unprepared civilians.
The “Wars on Terror” have galvanized whole societies, paradoxically turning them into combatants and into targets. The spectre of terrorism has also provided governments with political capital and the space to operate with impunity to fight terror. Consequently, the numbers of victims of terrorism continue to rise with increased numbers of purveyors of violence.
We in Sri Lanka too, have experienced many bouts and forms of violence. We have given these acts of violence different names at different times. Riots, pogroms, mob violence, street justice, uprisings, and insurrections, expressions of justifiable anger, the heinous crimes of extremists   - radicalized by political ideology or religion, civil war –are some of the words and phrases used to describe events and actions that struck terror into the hearts of victims and led to civilian deaths, injuries and destruction of property. Sri Lanka has seen bouts of violence since 1956 but the violence was not labelled as terrorism. However, from 1979 the word “terrorism” was embedded in our political discourse. But even as we intensified our fight against terrorism, the numbers affected increased.
The use of grenades, land mines, automatic firearms, and willing delivery agents of death – the suicide bombers – have intensified the violence and made acts of terrorism more difficult to contain, anticipate and repel and even comprehend. The common thread is that these acts of violence have targeted innocent civilians for maximum effect.
Remembering victims and honoring the victims, obligates us to do more to provide for a safer, better tomorrow. It obligates us to support survivors of terrorism who are physically and emotionally scarred – perhaps for life.  It obligates us to support the families of terror victims as they too suffer collateral damage.  It also obligates us to seek better ways of protecting civilians while preparing against future attacks. This in turn obligates us to identify the root causes of terrorism and makes efforts to address them. We must also be mindful of the need to protect people within the framework of the rule of law.
Remembrance must go beyond ceremonials. It must be accompanied by concerted actions to provide for a safer, better tomorrow.

13,"While defending a client, human rights defender Aleksey Ladin was taken into custody in Russian-occupied Crimea for allegedly displaying prohibited symbols on his social media (referring to a Facebook posts he published in 2018 of an image containing “taraq tamga” - the emblem on the Crimean Tatars’ flag) and discrediting the Russian military forces after he reshared a post which denounced Russian aggressions against Ukraine. His house was also  raided at the same time. 

The occupational Crimean department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia also stated that it is planning to disbar Aleksey Ladin. His work as a lawyer has consisted of defending Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar political prisoners in Russian-occupied Crimea, as well as Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians who were abducted and charged with criminal offences by the Russian authorities.

Front Line Defenders condemns the judicial harassment of Aleksey Ladin and believes this to be a clear act of reprisal for his legitimate and peaceful human rights work; and believes the expansion of the Russian Federation's Administrative and Criminal Codes fosters a culture of censorship which is being  disproportionately used to target HRDs working in the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.

Ending the growing plastic pollution has been a demand of many environmentally conscious individuals, groups and organizations. This ambition finally received some momentum when governments adopted a resolution setting up the path to a global treaty to end plastic pollution during the 5th Session of the United Nations Environmental Assembly in 2021. As a result, governments are currently negotiating an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution and the zero draft of the treaty will be negotiated during the upcoming INC3 in Nairobi, Kenya.

Sri Lanka has actively engaged in these negotiations together with other regional countries. CEJ has represented civil society in the treaty negotiations together with international networks such as International Pollutants Elimination Network, Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, Break free from Plastic and Friends of the Earth, etc. Developing country positions on the zero draft will be critical in upcoming negotiations.

We are organizing a stakeholder meeting ahead of the INC 3 in Nairobi, Kenya, to discuss the country’s position on the Zero draft of the Global Plastics Treaty and take stakeholder inputs.

The meeting will be held on 2nd November 2023 from 10.00 am – 2.00 pm at Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian and Research Institute, Colombo 07.

On 11 October, he received phone calls demanding he present himself for questioning in relation to the alleged disappearance of the aforementioned survivor. In the absence of a subpoena, the human rights defender refused to do so.

The Chechen authorities then detained his brother, threatening him, and forcing him to get in touch with Magomed. Fearing for his brothers life, the HRD traveled to Chechnya. On 23 October, the woman he accompanied contacted her relatives in the Chechen Republic to try to deescalate the situation. She then reported that Magomed was present at their house during the call; during the call he addressed her and said “I am at your house, surrounded by your relatives. My life and the life of my family is in danger. They gave me a week for you to return home. If you are not home in a week – they will kill me.” The Crew Against Torture have filed complaints to the Ministry of Interior and to the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation demanding protection for the human rights defender.

6,"After a combined experiment of National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA), SLCDF and community members, has come up with an oyster tumbling machine which is highly efficient low cost hand tool for women oyster farmers in Kalpitiyia area.  
Oyster tumbling machine is mainly used to grade and produce quality oysters on a weekly basis. 
On an experimental level initially a machine was introduced to Praja Sanwardhana Sanvidhanaya Kandakuliya that was equipped with nylon brushes and steel wool brushes. Cleaning mechanism was performed according to the rotating speed and cleaning power of attached brushes. It was manually operated and for easy operation a rotating power gear was included. Water should be poured with buckets (nearly 20L) and oysters loaded from either side of drum. It has the capacity to accommodate nearly 40-50 mature oysters in one cycle. Drain tap was attached to the side for dirty water removal. When testing the machine a few areas for improvement was observed.  
In the improved version of the tumbling machine the inside of the drum and the centre bar are lined with rubber mats which increase cleaning mechanism and protect oyster shells from any physical damage ensuring more safety of mature oysters. Mats having holes help sieve dirt on oysters drained to the tank with soiled water.  
The time previously spent on cleaning the oysters has been reduced by hours for the oyster farming women with the introduction of this handy machine. They see it as user friendly perfectly working machine that has given them extra time for family and other needs.   
This project has been funded by Stichting Gilles of Belgium and implemented with technical assistance from NARA. Similar machines would be provided to the two other community based organizations working under this project in Kalpitiya lagoon area.",1552303104,1,Sri Lanka Centre for Development Facilitation,2019-03-11T11:18:24.000Z

#DYK Many of the effects of lead on the nervous system last a lifetime and can include reduced IQ, difficulty learning, irritability, and anti-social behavior. As for Sri Lanka, we do not have statistics related to childhood lead poisoning and have no facilities for blood lead testing.

இலங்கையில் நிலவும் கடன் நெருக்கடியில் பெண்கள் பொருளாதார நீதியைக் கோருகின்றனர்
இலங்கையில் செயற்படும்  பெண்களுக்கான உரிமைக் குழுக்கள் தற்போதைய கடன் மறுசீரமைப்புத் தீர்வுகளை நிராகரிக்கின்றன, இத்தீர்வுகள் இலங்கையின் உழைக்கும் வர்க்கங்கள், குறிப்பாக பெண்கள் மீது கடன்களை திருப்பிச் செலுத்தும் சுமையை ஏற்படுத்துகிறது. இலங்கையில் நிலவும் கடன் நெருக்கடிக்கு, மக்களின் உண்மையான அனுபவங்கள், போராட்டங்கள் மற்றும் தேவைகளுக்குப் பதிலளிக்கும் அவசர மற்றும் நிலையான தீர்வுகளை பெண்கள் கோருகின்றனர்.
2023 ஆகஸ்ட் 9 முதல் 10 வரை கொழும்பில் நடைபெற்ற 'கடன் மற்றும் பெண்களின் மனித உரிமைகள் தொடர்பான தேசிய மாநாட்டில்' , இலங்கை மற்றும் பிற ஆசிய நாடுகளைச் சேர்ந்த பெண்களுக்கான  உரிமைக் குழுக்கள், தற்போதைய நெருக்கடி அவர்களின் வாழ்க்கையைப் பாதித்த விதம் மற்றும் பதிலளிப்பதற்கான அரசாங்க தீர்வுகளின் போதாமை குறித்து விவாதித்தன. அர்த்தமுள்ள வழிகளில். சர்வதேச நிதி நிறுவனங்கள் முக்கியமாக உலக வங்கி(wB) மற்றும் சர்தேச நிதி நிறுவனம் (IMF) ஆகியவை நியாயமற்ற சிக்கன நடவடிக்கைகளை மக்கள் மீது  சுமத்தும் வரலாற்றுப் பாத்திரத்தையும் தற்போதைய வகிபாகங்ளையும்  அவர்கள் கடுமையாக விமர்சித்தனர். பிராந்தியத்தில் மோசமடைந்து வரும் பொருளாதார நெருக்கடிகளில் பொறுப்புக்கூறல் இல்லாமையையும் அவர்கள் சுட்டிக் காட்டினர்..
மார்ச் 2023 நிலவரப்படி, மொத்த உள்நாட்டு உற்பத்தியில்(GDB) 103.8% சதவீதம்  தாங்க முடியாத கடன் சுமையின் காரணமாக, இலங்கை தற்போது முடங்கும் பொருளாதார நெருக்கடியை எதிர்கொண்டுள்ளது. கோவிட்-19 இன் அதிர்ச்சியிலிருந்து பலர் இன்னும் மீளாதவேளையில் இந்த நெருக்கடி குடும்பங்களைத் தாக்கியது. சர்வதேச நாணய நிதியத்தின் பிணையெடுப்பைப் பாதுகாப்பதற்கான சிக்கன நடவடிக்கைகளின் அரசாங்கத்தின் பிரதிபலிப்பு, எந்த ஒரு மக்கள்  ஆலோசனையும் இல்லாமல், அவசரமாக வெளியிடப்படுகிறது. இதில் பொதுச் செலவினங்களில் வெட்டுக்கள், பயன்பாட்டுக் கட்டணங்களில் செங்குத்தான அதிகரிப்பு, உணவு மற்றும் எரிசக்தி செலவுகள், மறைமுக மற்றும் பிற்போக்கு வரிவிதிப்பு, சமூகப் பாதுகாப்பு என வரையறுக்கப்பட்ட பணப் பட்டுவாடா ஆகியவை அடங்கும்.

இது குறிப்பாக குறைந்த மற்றும் நடுத்தர வருமானம் கொண்ட குடும்பங்களை பாதித்துள்ளது.. மேலும் தொழிலாளர் சட்டங்கள், ஊதியம் மற்றும் வேலை பாதுகாப்பில், குறிப்பாக பெண்களுக்கு திரும்பப்பெற அச்சுறுத்துகிறது. முக்கியமான வகையில், இலங்கை அரசாங்கம் ஊழியர் சேமலாப நிதியத்தின் வருமானத்தை இலங்கையின் கடனைத் திருப்பிச் செலுத்துவதற்குப் பயன்படுத்த முடிவு செய்துள்ளது - இலங்கையின் தொழிலாள வர்க்கத்தை பணக்கார கடனாளிகளுக்கு திருப்பிச் செலுத்தும் சுமையைத் தாங்கும்படி கட்டாயப்படுத்தியது - மேலும் அதற்கான எதிர்ப்பையும் சட்டரீதியான சவால்களையும் தடுத்துள்ளது.

உலகில் பணக்கார வருமானம் ஈட்டுபவர்களுக்கான கடனைச் செலுத்த தொழிலாளர்களின் சமூகப் பாதுகாப்பு நிதிகள் சமரசம் செய்யப்படுகின்றன. இலங்கையிலுள்ள மிகவும் கடின உழைப்பாளிகள் சிலரின் சேமிப்பை  (அவர்களில் பலருக்கு இதுவே ஒரே சேமிப்பாகும்) மாற்றுவதற்கு அரசாங்கம் தீர்மானித்துள்ளது,” என சட்டத்தரணியும்  சமூகச் செயற்பாட்டாளருமான லக்மாலி ஹேமச்சந்திர தெரிவித்தார். “உள்நாட்டு கடன் மறுசீரமைப்பில் கடுமையான மீறல்கள் நடக்கின்றன. மறுசீரமைப்பு செயல்முறை செப்டம்பரில் முடிவடையும், அந்த நேரத்தில், தொழிலாளர்கள் தங்கள் சேமிப்பின் பாதுகாப்பை இழப்பார்கள். தொழிலாளர்களின் சேமிப்பில் கடன் வழங்குபவர்களுக்கு ஊதியம் வழங்கப்படுவதையும், அரசாங்கமும் சர்வதேச நாணய நிதியமும் இதற்கு மக்கள் வாங்கும் நிலை உள்ளது என்ற நிலைப்பாட்டை தொடர்ந்து கொண்டிருப்பதை சர்வதேச சமூகம் கேட்கவும் கண்டிக்கவும் வேண்டும். மக்கள் வாங்குவது இல்லை, அதைத் தொடர்புகொள்வதற்கு மக்களுக்கு வழி இல்லை, ”என்று ஹேமச்சந்திர கூறினார்.

பொருளாதார நெருக்கடி மற்றும் கடனை மறுசீரமைப்பதற்கான தற்போதைய அரச தீர்வுகள் ஆகிய இரண்டாலும் பெண்கள் விகிதாசாரத்தில் பாதிக்கப்படுகின்றனர் என்பதை மாநாடு மீண்டும் உறுதிப்படுத்தியது. குடும்ப அளவில் ஊதியம் பெறாத கவனிப்புப் பாத்திரங்களின் காரணமாக, பெண்கள் பெரும்பாலும் குடும்பங்களுக்கு உணவு, கவனிப்பு மற்றும் கல்வியறிவு ஆகியவற்றை உறுதிப்படுத்தும் பொறுப்புகளை சுமக்கிறார்கள். சமூக பாதுகாப்பு. “தினசரி கடன்கள், வாராந்திரக்கடன்கள் மற்றும் அதிக வட்டி விகிதத்தில் கடன் வாங்குவதன் மூலம் மட்டுமே குடும்பங்கள் தங்கள் அடிப்படை உணவுத் தேவைகளைப் பூர்த்தி செய்ய முடியும். இனி நமது வருமானத்தைக் கொண்டு அடிப்படைத் தேவைகளை பூர்த்திசெய்ய முடியாது. இது எத்தகைய நியாயம்?” என்று பொருளாதார நீதிக்கான பெண்ணியக் கூட்டமைப்பின் ‘சுகன்யா காண்டீபன்’ தெரிவித்தார்.

சமூகப் பாதுகாப்பு என்பது ஒரு தொண்டு அல்ல, அனைத்து மக்களின் மனித உரிமை. இந்த நெருக்கடியான நேரத்தில் உலகளாவிய சமூகப் பாதுகாப்பை சட்டத்தால் கட்டுப்படுத்தவும், நடைமுறைப்படுத்தவும் வேண்டும் என்று மகளிர் குழுக்கள் கோருகின்றன. சமூகப் பாதுகாப்பு வலை அமைப்புகளின் அர்த்தமுள்ள விரிவாக்கம் மற்றும் நிதி ஒதுக்கீட்டை அதிகரிக்காமல், ‘அஸ்வெசும’ போன்ற இலக்குத் திட்டங்கள் நெருக்கடியால் கடுமையாக பாதிக்கப்பட்டுள்ள மில்லியன் கணக்கான குடும்பங்களுக்கு பயனளிக்காது. ""உலகளாவிய சமூகப் பாதுகாப்பிற்கு நிதியளிப்பதற்காக, அரசாங்கம் பணக்காரர்களுக்கு வரி விதிக்கத் தொடங்க வேண்டும், பெருநிறுவனங்களுக்கு வரி விதிக்க வேண்டும் மற்றும்பெறுமதிசேர் வரி (VAT) போன்ற பிற்போக்குத்தனமான நுகர்வோர் வரிகளை உடனடியாகக் குறைக்க வேண்டும், மேலும் GDP இன் தற்போதைய வரம்பான 0.6%க்கு அப்பால் சமூகப் பாதுகாப்பிற்கான பட்ஜெட் ஒதுக்கீட்டை விரிவுபடுத்த வேண்டும். வீட்டுக் கடனில் உள்ள அழுத்தத்தைப் போக்க மற்ற வகையான ஆதரவைச் சேர்க்க சமூகப் பாதுகாப்பையும் விரிவுபடுத்த வேண்டும்: உத்தரவாதமான வேலை நாட்கள், வாராந்திர ஊட்டச்சத்து உணவுக் கூடை, சுகாதாரம் மற்றும் கல்வி ஆதரவு மற்றும் போக்குவரத்து ஆதரவு. – ‘சரளா இம்மானுவேல்’, பொருளாதார நீதிக்கான பெண்ணியக் கூட்டமைப்பு.

ஜுவான் பாப்லோ போஹோஸ்லாவ்ஸ்கி, கடன் மற்றும் மனித உரிமைகள் தொடர்பான முன்னாள் ஐ.நா. சுதந்திர நிபுணர், “உள்நாட்டு கடன் வழங்குபவர்களை மட்டும் ஏன் அரசாங்கம் தியாகம் செய்து, ஓரளவிற்கு, அவர்களின் கடனை வெட்ட வேண்டும் என்று கேட்கப்பட்டது என்பதையும் நாம் கேள்விக்கு உடபடுத்த வேண்டும். வெளிநாட்டுக் கடன் வைத்திருப்பவர்களும், இறையாண்மைக் கடனை ஒரு நிலையான நிலைக்குக் கொண்டுவர இதேபோன்ற பங்களிப்பைச் செய்யுமாறு கேட்டுக் கொள்ளப்பட வேண்டும். சர்வதேசச் சட்டத்தின்படி, இலங்கைச் சூழலில், பாகுபாடு காட்டுவதைத் தடை செய்வது என்பது இறையாண்மைக் கடன் மறுசீரமைப்பில் கடனாளர்களுக்கு இடையிலான சமபங்கு ஆகும்.

ஆசியா மற்றும் பசுபிக் நாடுகளில் தற்போது கடன் நெருக்கடியின் தாக்கங்களை எதிர்கொள்ளும் பல நாடுகளில் இலங்கையும் ஒன்றாகும். ஆசிய பசிபிக் பிராந்தியத்தில் வாழும்  பெண்களின்  உரிமைக் குழுக்கள் இலங்கை மக்களுடன் ஒற்றுமையை வெளிப்படுத்தியுள்ளன, சட்டத்.திற்கும் அபிவிருத்திக்குமான  ஆசிய பசிபிக் ஒன்றியத்தின் பெண்களது  (APWLD)  பிராந்திய ஒருங்கிணைப்பாளர் ‘மிசுன் வூ’ கூறுகையில், “கடன் நெருக்கடியில் பெண்கள் கடக்கும் எண்ணற்ற வன்முறைக் கதைகளைக் கேட்பது மூர்க்கத்தனமானது. ஆசியா மற்றும் பசிபிக் பிராந்தியம் ;  முழுவதும் பெண்களின் கதைகள் புதிய காலனித்துவம் மற்றும் ஏகாதிபத்தியத்தின் தெளிவான வெளிப்பாடான 'கடன் சூத்திரம்' இருப்பதை உறுதிப்படுத்துகிறது, இது மக்களின் உயிரையும், கண்ணியத்தையும், இறையாண்மையையும் பறிக்கிறது.

The 2nd module training started off by initially looking into the assignments given to these trainees at the end of the 1st module training last November. Each of them presented the services they provided for mental health in the districts and the facts of the findings on the resources available.

The 2nd module focused to impart both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in individual counselling so that participants are able to address the basic mental health needs of the community through life education and counselling.

கணவன், தந்தை,  சகோதரர்கள்,நெருங்கிய உறவினர்களுடன் ஏற்படக்கூடிய சில மோதல்கள்கூட  வீட்டு வேலைகள் மற்றும் பிள்ளைகளின் வேலைகள் போன்றவற்றுடன் சம்பந்தப்பட்டதாக இல்லாமலும் இல்லை.  அதனால் வீட்டில் மேற்கொள்ளப்படும் வேலைகளை அதிகமாகச் செய்யவேண்டிய நிலை பெண்களுக்கு ஏற்படும். 

இதன்காரணமாக சிலபோது உடலளவில் மாத்திரமின்றி மனதளவிலும் அவர்கள் அழுத்தங்களுக்கு உள்ளாக இடமுண்டு. சிறுவயது முதலே பெண்பிள்ளைகளுக்கே உரியது எனக்கூறி வீட்டுவேலைகளுக்கு அவளைப் பழக்கப்படுத்தும் இந்த “சமூகம்”, அதிலுள்ள முழுப்பொறுப்பையும், குறிப்பாக தாயெனில் பிள்ளைகளின் பொறுப்பையும் பெண்களின்மீதே சுமத்தும்.  அதேபோல் தவறுகள் ஏற்படுகின்றபோதும் குற்றஞ்சாட்டப்படுவதும் பிள்ளைகளோ தந்தையோ அல்லர். மாறாக “பிள்ளைகளின் தாய்” என்ற ரீதியில் பெண்கள்மீதே ஆகும்.

பால்நிலை அடிப்படையிலான வன்முறைகளுக்கு எதிரான 16 நாட்கள் செயற்பாடுகள் மேற்கொள்ளப்படுவது நவம்பர் 25 ஆம் திகதியில் இருந்து டிசம்பர் 10 ஆம் திகதி வரையாகும். 
பெண்களும் மனிதர்களே. அடுத்தவர்களுக்குச் சமமான கவனிப்புக்களைப் பெறுவதற்கும், கௌரவத்தைப் பெற்றுக்கொள்வதற்கும் பெண்களுக்கும் முழு உரிமை உண்டு. 

மௌனமாகவும் தனியாகவும் பராமரிப்புப் பணிகளை மேற்கொள்ளும் பெண்களின் உடல்சார்- உளம்சார் அழுத்தங்களை அடையாளம் காண்போம். அந்த நிலைமையை மாற்றுவதற்காக ஆண்களுக்கும் பராமரிப்புப் பணிகளின் வகிபங்கொன்றை ஏற்படுத்த வேண்டியுள்ளது. பராமரிப்புப் பணி என்பது மனிதர்களிடம் பொதுவாகக் காணப்படக்கூடிய திறைமையே அன்றி அவை தனியாக பெண்களுக்கு மாத்திரமான பொறுப்பல்ல என்பதுடன் முழுமொத்த ஆண் தரப்பினர்களினதும் பொறுப்புமாகும் என்பதை கவனத்திற்கொள்ள வேண்டும். 

""வலுவூட்டும் கண்ணீர்.... அவள் அம்மா!"" - பெண்கள் மற்றும் ஊடகக் கூட்டமைப்பினால் ஏற்பாடு செய்யப்பட்ட ""பராமரிப்புப் பணிகள் பற்றி எனக்குத் தோன்றுவது” எனும் சிறுவர் சித்திரப் போட்டியில் 14-16 வயதுக்கிடைப்பட்ட பிரிவில் மூன்றாம் இடத்தைப் பெற்றுக்கொண்ட பதுளை மாவட்ட புஷ்பித்த சந்துன் சந்திரரத்ன எனும் மாணவனால் வரையப்பட்ட சித்திரமே இந்தப் படத்தில் காட்டப்பட்டுள்ளது.

9,"Human rights defender Javier Medardo Feijoo Villa has been targeted with several death threats to him and his family through ongoing  calls and voice messages. The callers, who targeted him for two weeks in early October, claim to have him under surveillance, and have access to his data, as well as tracking all his movements. 

Front Line Defenders believes these threats are linked to his peaceful activity as a community leader, where he works to stop criminal acts and illicit activities (ma
inly assaults and robberies caused by criminal groups that threaten the area), and defend the water, nature and  territories belonging to local communities.

We urge the Ecuadorian authorities to initiate an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into the death threats and guarantee the human rights defender and his family’s protection and physical integrity, as well as bringing those responsible to justice in accordance with international standards.

With this in mind as of now 9 village level awareness programmes have been conducted by the TOT trainers in the 3 Urban Councils of Northern Province Chavakachcheri, Valvettithurai and Point Pedro from the 4th to 12th of December 2018. The partner organizations of this Solid Waste Management project VOGT (Vadamarachchy Organization of Good Templars), CORE (Consortiums of Organizations for Rural Empowerment) and CFCD (Center for Child Development) have played a significant role in organizing these programmes. These awareness programmes mainly focus on educating the villagers on the 3R system and help them initiate waste segregation from their households. Also some of the present participants were keen in finding alternatives for polythene bags. A beach clean-up and awareness programme too was held for the coastal community advising them to collect the garbage littered along the beaches once a week.

Women in Sri Lanka demand economic justice in the face of the ongoing debt crisis 
********************************************
Women’s rights groups in Sri Lanka reject the current debt restructuring solutions that place the burden of repayment on Sri Lanka’s working classes, particularly its women. They are demanding urgent and sustainable solutions to the ongoing debt crisis in Sri Lanka, that respond to the actual lived experiences, struggles, and needs of the people. 
At the ‘National Convening on Debt and Women’s Human Rights’ held in Colombo on 9-10 August 2023, women’s rights groups from Sri Lanka and other Asian countries discussed the ways the ongoing crisis has impacted their lives and the inadequacy of government solutions to respond in meaningful ways. They also severely criticized the historical and current roles played by international financial institutions mainly the World Bank and IMF in imposing unjust austerity measures and their lack of accountability in worsening economic crises in the region. 
Sri Lanka is currently going through a crippling economic crisis because of an unsustainable debt burden of 103.8% of GDP as of March 2023. This crisis hit households at a time when many had not yet recovered from the shocks of COVID-19. The government response of austerity measures to secure an International Monetary Fund bailout are being hurriedly rolled out, with no public consultation. This has included cuts in public spending, steep increases in utility tariffs, food and energy costs, indirect and regressive taxation, and limited cash handouts as social security. 
This has particularly impacted low to middle-income families, and labor laws that threaten to roll back gains in wage and job security, especially for women. Critically, the Government of Sri Lanka has decided to use the earnings of the Employee Provident Funds to repay Sri Lanka’s debt - forcing Sri Lanka’s working class to bear the burden of repaying the wealthiest creditors - and has blocked resistance and legal challenges to the same. 
“The social security funds of workers are being compromised to pay the debt for the richest income earners in the world. The government has decided to trade off the savings - for many of them this is the only savings - of some of the most hardworking people in Sri Lanka,” said lawyer and activist, Lakmali Hemachandra. “There are severe violations going on with the domestic debt restructuring. The restructuring process is due to finish in September and by that time, workers will lose the security of their savings. We need the international community to hear and condemn the fact that creditors are being paid with workers' savings and the Government and IMF is continuing to hold the position that there is people’s buy-in for this. There is no people's buy-in, people just don’t have a way to communicate that,” Hemachandra said.
The Convening reaffirmed that women are disproportionately affected by both the economic crisis and current state solutions to restructure the debt. Due to their unpaid caregiving roles at the household level, women often shoulder responsibilities of ensuring families are fed looked after, and educated, even as they face falling wages, rising food, electricity, and water bills, precarious and informal employment, and lack of access to meaningful social security. “Households can only meet their basic food needs by taking daily loans, weekly loans, and other borrowings at very high-interest rates. We cannot manage basic needs with our income anymore. How is this fair?” said Suganya Kandeepan, Feminist Collective for Economic Justice.     
Social security is not charity but a human right of all people. Women’s groups are demanding that universal social security in this time of crisis be made binding and enforceable by law. Without meaningful expansion of social safety nets and increasing fiscal allocation, targeted schemes like Aswesuma will not benefit the millions of families hit hard by the crisis. “In order to fund universal social security, we demand the government start taxing the rich, taxing corporations and reduce regressive consumer taxes like VAT with immediate effect, and expand budgetary allocation for social security beyond the current limit of 0.6% of GDP. We need to also expand social security to include other forms of support to relieve stress on household debt: guaranteed days of work, weekly nutritional food basket, health and education support, and transport support.” - Sarala Emmanuel, Feminist Collective for Economic Justice. 
Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, Former UN Independent Expert on Debt and Human Rights said, “We also need to question why only domestic creditors have been asked by the government to make a sacrifice and accept, to some extent, a haircut in their credit. External debt holders should also be asked to make a similar contribution to bring sovereign debt to a sustainable level. According to international law, in the Sri Lankan context, prohibition of discrimination means inter-creditor equity in sovereign debt restructuring.”
Sri Lanka is one of several countries in Asia and the Pacific currently grappling with the impacts of a debt crisis. Women’s rights groups across Asia Pacific have expressed solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka, with the Regional Coordinator of APWLD Misun Woo saying, “It is outrageous to hear countless similar stories of violence women go through in a debt crisis.  Women’s stories across Asia and the Pacific confirm that there is a ‘debt formula’ which is a clear manifestation of neo-colonialism and imperialism that takes away peoples’ life, dignity, and sovereign power.  APWLD stands in solidarity with the women and people of Sri Lanka and joins your struggles for justice and freedom. “
The national convening was co-organized by the Law and Society Trust (LST), National Fisheries Solidarity Organisation (NAFSO), The Women and Media Collective (WMC), Colombo Urban Lab, The Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law, and Development (APWLD). Participants included representatives from groups of labor activists, trade unions, rural and urban women, academia, and civil society from Sri Lanka and Asia.

With only about USD 124 to 143 billion flowing into global biodiversity conservation efforts, this leaves a huge financing gap amounting to USD 711 billion per year. To bridge this gap and demonstrate how nature-positive economies can work for people and the planet, @undp ’s Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) convened over 68 biodiversity finance experts including partners from governments and the private sector from Europe, Asia and Pacific for the 9th Regional Dialogue that took place this week in Sigirya, Sri Lanka 🇱🇰

The Regional Dialogue covered a wide array of finance solutions that unlock finance for nature such as public sector financing, subsidies, results-based budgeting, financial technology, and collaboration with finance and private sectors to finance other effective conservation measures or OECMs, pilot biodiversity credits and bonds, promote nature-financial disclosures, among others, towards the countries’ attainment of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans.

H D Shelton Perera, also going by the name ‘Siyambala Gaha Yata Kaluu,’ transformed his roadside food shop into a cinema museum. 

Since childhood, Shelton has collected posters, newspaper articles, books and portraits of Sri Lankan cinema legends – even going as far as to buy them from various photographers and collectors. He mostly owes his quirky hobby to his idols, Gamini Fonseka and H R Jothipala!

Shelton says, “I even had Jothi’s photo that was used on his death notice. I gave it to his daughters 15 years after his death.”

Shelton’s cinema museum had a massive collection until 2012, when a group of people including the police, destroyed his stall for unknown reasons. Even now, some steal and resell photographs from his collection.

Despite all the troubles, Shelton keeps collecting and safeguarding these valuable memories from the past. People often go to him with the idea of buying photos from him, but Shelton firmly says his collection is not for sale.
 
And yet, Shelton welcomes anyone with a warm smile to share all he knows about the history of Sri Lankan cinema.

📍Shelton’s Cinema Museum is located on the roadside in front of the Wijeya Newspapers Head Office; the junction adjoining W A D Ramanayake Mawatha with the Hunupitiya Cross Road, Colombo 02.

One of these SMEs is TOMECO An Khang, a producer of environmental decontamination equipment, agriculture dryer machines, and industrial fans. TOMECO’s 2020 revenue decreased more than 24% compared to the previous year. To bounce back from these effects, TOMECO’s Chairman, Mr. Kha, attended a workshop held by IESC’s USAID LinkSME project and the Ministry of Planning and Investment on digital transformation. Following this workshop, Mr. Kha registered for additional one-on-one support from the project to develop and implement a comprehensive digital transformation roadmap. With project support, TOMECO has reviewed and developed improvement plans for its current planning and monitoring systems, launched a customer relationship management system to improve engagement of existing customers, adopted a master data management system and cyber security system to speed decision-making and mitigate information security risks, and launched barcodes and traceability programs to track its products through the production process. While TOMECO, its employees, and its customers have benefitted from this transformation, a broader impact is unfolding given the example it is setting for other SMEs, inspiring them to take steps towards digital transformation. #MSMEDay

Years later, the workers, including FLD's 2023 Award winner Segundo Ordoñez, are still waiting for reparations, and the delay of the judicial mechanisms mean the Ecuadorian government continues to be exonerated from liability. Meanwhile, the economic and social situation of the abacaleros is increasingly precarious, and they face ongoing threats and harassment.

25,"The Peruvian Indigenous leader Angel Pedro Valerio, known for defending his territory, and for advocating for indigenous and environmental rights in the face of drug trafficking mafias, illegal logging and land grabbing in the Ashaninka territory, is facing an investigation and preliminary arrest order for his alleged involvement in the disappearance of four people in April 2023.

His defense claims that he has been unjustly accused as he was not present in the area in the moment of the disappearance, which took place in the context of a protest for the killing of another Ashaninka indigenous leader. It is clear that there is a need for an independent investigation to clarify this very serious case; nevertheless, Front Line Defenders believes the investigation has been weaponised as an opportunity to undermine Pedro Valerio’ work as a human rights defender.

Front Line Defenders urges Peruvian authorities to respect his right to presumption of innocence and to drop the warrant for his arrest while an impartial investigation is carried out.

7,"Yesterday, the Supreme Court of Belarus upheld Nasta Loika’s seven years imprisonment sentence for “incitement of racial, national, religious or other social enmity or discord”. Since her detention a year ago, she has been systematically denied the exercise of her rights in prison through bans on personal correspondence and inhumane treatment (including physical and psychological violence). They have also targeted her lawyers,  hindering her right to defense.

Nasta Loika, named as a woman human rights defender of 2022 by Belarus Human Rights House, works in human rights education. Her work includes addressing repressive “anti-extremist” laws and advocating for the protection of migrants and the rights of stateless people in Belarus.

Front Line Defenders condemns the decision to uphold her sentence, which reflects a wider trend of increased targeting of human rights defenders and civil society by Belarus authorities.

Prison authorities have been tube-feeding him in order to keep him alive, yet no answer has come to pleas for his release and requests for better conditions.  

Guo Feixiong (郭飞雄), Front Line Defenders Awards’ 2015 laureate, is currently serving an eight-year sentence issued in May as punishment for “inciting subversion of State power” and has a travel ban that impedes him from seeing his children. He is a well-known HRD in #China for his work on democracy, anti-corruption and censorship, and has previously been imprisoned twice, totalling eleven years in prison.

Front Line Defenders is extremely concerned by his rapidly deteriorating health and urges the Chinese authorities to release him and ensure that he has prompt access to adequate medical care.

Maryam Al-Khawaja was barred from boarding a British Airways flight to Bahrain for a visit that she had publicly announced to pressure the Bahraini authorities to release her detained father, Danish-Bahraini human rights defender Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, Amnesty International, Front Line Defenders, and ActionAid Denmark announced today.

She was being accompanied by a delegation of leading figures from three human rights organizations; Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard; Olive Moore and Andrew Anderson, who are current and former directors of Front Line Defenders; and Timothy Whyte, Secretary General of ActionAid Denmark, all of whom were also denied checking in for the flight.

Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja has been a prisoner of conscience since 2011, when Bahrain detained him for his role in spearheading political protests against the monarchy during the Arab Spring. His arrest was accompanied by torture, resulting in deteriorating health marked by chronic pain. Over the past two years, he has also suffered from glaucoma and cardiac arrhythmia. He is currently on hunger strike in protest of prison conditions and his family fears for his life.

As the one year anniversary of the death of #MahsaAmini and the #WomenLifeFreedom movement looms, human rights defenders continue to face harassment, targeting, arrest and imprisonment. 

The death of this young Kurdish woman while in custody of the morality police for allegedly not conforming with the country’s discriminatory veiling rules caused protests to erupt all around the country in September 2022. Although one year has passed since the start of the protests in the wake of Mahsa Amini’s death, and the international community’s attention to the crisis has somewhat faded, human rights defenders remain at heightened risk and continue to endure human rights violations.

The NHRCI being provided the platform to host this event amounts to an endorsement of its sub-par performance in protection and promotion of human rights, and their disregard for concerns regarding its functioning, appointment procedure, lack of pluralism, independence and transparency.

We urge the forum's Secretariat to reconsider the decision in hopes of demanding accountability ""rather than providing [India] an opportunity to whitewash its disregard and non-compliance with international human rights standards.""

Their following transfer to another prison means that Kamyar Fakour will no longer be in the same prison as his also detained wife, and may not be able to meet with her weekly, and that Jafar Ebrahimi, who has lost eight kilograms due to an inflammatory disease and is diabetic, will continue to lack proper medical attention. 

We are extremely concerned by the failure of the authorities to respond effectively to Jafar Ebrahimi’s deteriorating health and condemn the ongoing judicial harassment faced by the human rights defenders.

With a long history of convening similar bodies, none of which has provided justice, truth or reparation to the many people who have engaged with them, Sri Lanka's latest initiative risks repeating the mistakes of the past, exposing victims to renewed security threats and re-traumatization without any realistic chance of a different outcome. 

""Any successful transitional justice process requires inclusive consultation with stakeholders, including with victims and civil society organizations, and substantial confidence-building measures to ensure that victims can participate without fear. It must have credibility among affected communities.""

We urge the Sri Lankan government to approach transitional justice as a holistic process that includes truth-seeking, investigation and prosecution of international crimes, and effective remedies such as reparations, redress and guarantees of non-recurrence.

Marielle was a community activist for many years before becoming a city councillor in 2016. As an Afro-Brazilian, woman human rights defender, she advocated for housing rights for some of the city’s poorest and most marginalised residents, defended women’s and LGBT rights and worked against systemic racism. She had become an expert on policing and was outspoke in her criticism of the violence that often accompanied the military and police presence in Rio’s favellas.

Marielle and Anderson Pedro Gomes, a colleague who was driving her car, were shot dead by two assailants on Wednesday, 14 March on Joaquim Palhares Street, in the Central Region of Rio de Janeiro. It is suspected that this was a targeted killing meant to silence Marielle for the work she had been carrying out. 
 
Marielle is honored at the HRD Memorial in the Iveagh Gardens in Dublin City. Her daughter Luyara, a human rights defender herself, spent the last few weeks in Dublin and visited the memorial, honoring her moth.

- FREEDOM MEANS BREAKING FRAMES -

Join us in a heartfelt conversation with Angel Queentus, a courageous transgender woman, as we delve into the challenges she has faced due to societal norms and her inspiring journey of embracing her true identity. Let's celebrate the power of freedom. 🦋✨

சுதந்திரம் என்பது வரையறைகளை தகர்த்தெறிவது - ஏஞ்சல் (Angel Queentus)

யாழ்ப்பாணம் எப்படியும் இருக்கமான சட்டங்களைக் கொண்ட மாகாணம்.
ஒரு சாதாரண பெண் கூட மாலை ஆறு மணிக்கு மேல் வெளியே செல்ல வேண்டாம் என்று தான் சொல்வார்கள். நான் திருநர் என்பதால் நிலைமை இன்னும் மோசம்.

பள்ளிப் பருவத்திலிருந்தே எனது பால்நிலை பற்றி எனக்குப் பிரச்சனைகள் ஏற்பட்டது. இறுதியாக நான் அதை தைரியமாக, வலுவாக எதிர்கொள்ள முடிவு செய்தேன்.

பெண்ணாய் பிறந்தால் இப்படி இருக்க வேண்டும், ஆணாய் பிறந்தால் இப்படி இருக்க வேண்டும் என்று சமூக நியமங்கள் உள்ளன. இது அனைவரின் சுதந்திரத்திற்கும் ஓர் தடையாக உள்ளது.

நாம் முதலில் பொருளாதார ரீதியாக வலுவாகவும் சுதந்திரமாகவும் இருக்க வேண்டும். அதன் பிறகு, தங்கள் அடையாளத்திற்காக தாங்கள் வேலை செய்யத் தொடங்க வேண்டும். அதுவே இப்போதைக்கு சிறந்த தீர்வு.

Currently in its development phase, is forecasted to peak towards the end of 2023 in the Asia Pacific region. If the situation continues, we must be ready to embrace a similar, if not worse, scenario that will have direct impact on communities, especially in the availability of water. 

Today is a particularly opportune time to bring this issue to the limelight as Sri Lanka hosts the fifth Forum of Ministers and Environment Authorities of Asia Pacific, with the aim of contributing to the outcome of the sixth session of the UN Environment Programme Assembly happening in 2024. 

The Green Climate Fund financed, Climate Resilient Integrated Water Management Project (CRIWMP) implemented by the Government of Sri Lanka together with United Nations Development Programme - UNDP in Sri Lanka, offers a blueprint to reviving Sri Lanka’s cascade system for water resilience, incorporating modern technologies and climate resilient infrastructure, climate information services and agro-met advisories to create a more sustainable dry-zone eco-system and enhance climate resilience.

Over the past two years, the Taliban have imposed increasingly abusive policies especially against women and girls and religious and ethnic minorities that clearly violate Afghanistan’s obligations under international human rights law. Policies that ban and restrict women and girls from education, work and other livelihood opportunities, free movement and access to public spaces and services have been widely condemned. In their joint report to the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council, published in June 2023, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Afghanistan and the UN Working Group on Discrimination Against Women and Girls stated that the Taliban treatment of women and girls “may amount to gender persecution – a crime against humanity – and be characterised as gender apartheid”.

=======================================

Earlier this year, international and regional networks working for a rapid, equitable and just transition out of fossil fuels decided to escalate globally coordinated campaigning efforts in view of; very weak outcomes of COP27 on the fossil fuel phase-outs, backtracking by the G7 and other wealthy countries from their earlier pledge to  phase out public financing of fossil fuels, continued low ambition and loopholes in the decarbonization policy of public and private financing institutions, the continuing  increase in fossil fuel production globally and the aggressive push for the expansion of the gas industry justifying gas as transition fuel and using the global energy crisis as an excuse, and increase in efforts of governments and corporations to promote false solutions in the form of abatement technologies that will serve to the extend of life of fossil fuel projects.

Today we organized a protest at Galle Fort to stand with Asian Peoples' Movement on Debt and Development and demand maximization of the key moments of the United Nations General Assembly and United Nations Secretary General Climate Ambition Summit to demonstrate the escalating global fight to end fossil fuels in Asia, to demonstrate to governments corporations and institutions, media and general public that the fight against fossil fuels has broadened and heightened in the Asia region, to assert, popularize and amplify our calls and demands to complement the push for a more aggressive anti-fossil gas narrative.

This is an annual tradition brought to life by a group of Sri Lankan youths who fight for marine life conservation around Sri Lanka; The Pearl Protectors. 

Using PET bottles the group collected over the year at their beach clean-ups, they managed to build a  tree that’s over 12 feet tall – including its various ornaments. 

More importantly, what are the Pearl Protectors trying to tell us?
No matter the season, we're in a climate emergency, and festive seasons are when our plastic footprints go through the roof. The PET bottle Christmas tree reminds us of the impact of single-use plastic and inspires hope for a more sustainable 2024.

He has dedicated his life’s work to advocating for environmental rights, land rights and land justice; pushing for transparent, accountable, and sustainable governance of land tenure regimes for the country’s lands. In 2008, he co-founded the NGO ‘’Alerte Congolaise pour l’Environnement et les Droits de l’Homme’’ , through which he has actively supported and represented local communities, groups and individuals working on the environment for over 15 years.

Olivier has been persecuted and faced grave danger due to his human rights work, targeted by recurring death threats and an attempted assasination, which caused him to flee his home country and go into exile for his own protection. He has been severely beaten and tortured by security forces; once to the point of needing hospitalisation for 12 days. His organisation has also faced attempts of sabotage such as robbery and break-ins. Despite these harrowing circumstances, he is hopeful and inspired to continue securing justice for the victims of land and environmental injustices in the DRC, especially at-risk and vulnerable groups like women and children.
Olivier is known as the ‘’Green Lawyer’’ in North Kivu because of his defence of Virunga Park and its workers and people. The communities he has represented face economic expropriation and exploitation of their land and resources. In the context of the DRC, this has affected women and children most – many women have lost their husbands in the conflict and are left vulnerable. They are then driven off their land, which has plunged them into grave insecurity.

Civil society voices have always been strong in Ukraine, reaching a peak in 2013 with the EuroMaidan clashes, aimed at overthrowing a pro-Russian government. Russia’s war in Ukraine, that started with occupation of Crimea in 2014 and destabilisation and shadow support to the so-called separatist movement in Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, has posed a grave danger to human rights defenders in the occupied territories.

When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in Ukraine on 24 February 2022, human rights defenders and groups experienced blackouts and disruptions in communications due to Russia’s shelling of Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. There have been significant fluctuations in internet connectivity in many regions of Ukraine, impeding the ability to document and report on war crimes and human rights violations. DSLU’s work has been integral to rebuilding digital security infrastructure and documentation of war crimes, ensuring that organisations could continue to operate by providing and setting up satellite internet kits for teams working on documenting and reporting war crimes.
Despite the circumstances of the war, while many fled to safety, DSLU stayed on the ground, recognising the crucial digital needs of the context. This was not easy and came with significant safety and security challenges.

22,"Segundo Ordóñez is an Afro-descendant human rights defender from Esmeraldas, Ecuador. His family migrated from Tumaco, Colombia when he was a child, due to the violence and poverty they experienced there. For most of his life in Ecuador, he lived and worked on abacá (Manila hemp) plantations with abacaleros (Manila-hemp worker), for the Japanese company ‘’Furukawa Plantaciones C. A’’ – a company which produces and exports abacá fibre. Abacá is formed from the stalks of banana trees, used and exported to the US and Europe for paper money, rope, teabags, cars and more. Ecuador is the second largest exporter of abacá fibre, yet those who farm the raw materials have done so under slavery-like conditions.

Abacaleros, including Segundo, united after years of discrimination, and took the company and the State of Ecuador to court, accusing them of plunging at least three generations of impoverished rural workers into conditions of modern slavery. With the support of the civil society solidarity committee “Furukawa Nunca Más”, constitutional and criminal proceedings were instituted against the company but so far they have not achieved justice or any type of reparation for the abacaleros. When the case became public in 2019, the company retaliated and demolished some of the camps where abacaleros and their families lived, and evicted hundreds of other families from the camps. Segundo, along with a group of abacaleros, resisted the evictions by remaining in two of the camps owned by the company – an occupation which continues four years on.
Inspired by his bravery and ability to maintain community cohesion, Segundo became the representative of his community in legal proceedings, playing a key role in confronting the company in court and in public, which has also come at a risk to his life.
As a result of his resistance, he has been targeted in a number of ways ranging from consistent harassment, ‘’SLAPP’’ and other lawsuits filed by the company to intimidate and discredit him, and more recently, death threats.",1685098984,5,Front Line Defenders,2023-05-26T11:03:04.000Z

Rose played a significant role in uniting indigenous and community-based schools in Mindanao and coordinated with national groups on a campaign to stop militarisation, environmental plunder and land grabbing of ancestral lands. She has faced violence from different authorities many times during peaceful protests, yet she has persisted in her cause with courage, leadership, and dedication. She became the spokesperson of the Save Our Schools Network (SOS Network) in 2019, a network of child-focused NGOs, church-based groups and other stakeholders who bring attention to, and take action regarding the ongoing violation of children’s right to education, particularly in the context of militarisation and attacks on schools.

Rose’s journey began as a volunteer teacher for the Lumad communities in Mindanao, during which time she raised awareness on the human rights violations the Lumads were facing. Beyond basic education, Rose also taught practical skills such as agriculture that would help students enrich their environment, culture, and defend their ancestral lands. Rose helped build a communal farm in several schools for students to have hands-on experience with agriculture.
Rose was a part of the ‘’Lumad Bakwit school” from 2018 until 2021, where hundred of indigenous students from southern Philippines gather in main cities to protest against human rights violations of indigenous and minority groups. As the spokesperson of SOS Network, she is at the forefront of many public gatherings, protests and meetings, and is consistently red-tagged and monitored as a leader, facing reprisals and threats, both directly and indirectly.

32,"Hala Ahed is a Jordanian woman human rights defender and lawyer. Born in December 1971 in Kuwait, Hala moved to Amman, Jordan when she was 10 years old, and has lived there since. Hala has conducted significant work in the human rights landscape in Jordan, and is well recognised in civil society as a trusted leader and ally. The focus of her work has been women’s rights, but within the political context of Jordan, she has also worked across freedom of opinion and expression, labour rights, and trade union freedoms.

Despite her vital work and advocacy, Hala has endured various forms of intimidation and harassment, including being summoned multiple times by the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate (GID). She has recieved threats from authorities who have gone as far as threatening her son in order to get to her. Hala grew her public legitimacy by increasing her visibility and public profile, and building a support network which has given her public credibility.
Most recently, Hala was a victim of NSO’s Pegasus digital hacking spyware initiated by the government. It was found that she was being surveilled when her mobile device was infected with Pegasus in March 2021. In other instances, Hala was targeted with online defamation campaigns where government-backed social media accounts would storm her account with harassment. Over the years as a lawyer, Hala represented and defended human rights defenders, activists, rights movements, civil society organisations and trade unions, making herself known as a strong ally for civil society in Jordan. She supported multiple unions with voluntary legal representation, including the Jordan Teachers’ Syndicate which represents more than 14,000 teachers; and the Agricultural Association. Her human rights work goes beyond the realms of her desk and books. Despite all the obstacles, dangers and restrictions she faces for her human rights work, Hala continues to be dedicated in her pursuit of improving the human rights situation in Jordan for all.",1685098442,1,Front Line Defenders,2023-05-26T10:54:02.000Z

The criminalisation of defenders, including WHRDs, journalists and anti-corruption defenders was unrelenting during the year.

In addition to the threat of criminalisation, those defending indigenous peoples’, Afro-descendant communities’, land and environmental rights were exposed to persistent and alarming levels of violence by both state and non-state actors, including widespread killings. In the midst of a prevailing rhetoric of “gender ideology” that has become normalised in the region in recent years, the risks to LGBTIQ+ defenders and WHRDs remained particularly acute.

F2F and Equity Bank trained 251 women from 12 village saving and loan associations (VSLAs) in Morogoro and Mvomero districts to build their budgeting, saving, and financial planning skills so that the women farmers can achieve their business goals. Equity Bank, in turn, developed a specific financial product called the Mwanamke Fanikisha loan product specifically geared towards women lacking material assets that would allow them to access finance in the traditional marketplace. Because of this intervention, more women farmers in Tanzania have access to bank accounts and financial services, enabling them to grow their agribusinesses. #IWD2023 #EmbraceEquity",1678209314,0,IESC,2023-03-07T17:15:14.000Z

5,"Our #GlobalAnalysis22 showed that human rights defenders (HRDs) in Asia faced unprecedented challenges in 2022 as they pushed back against regressive states, including legal persecution combined with misuse and abuse of anti-terrorism frameworks and growing restrictions on the rights to privacy and freedoms of expression, assembly and movement. 

Over the years, state authorities across the region have regularly targeted and vilified HRDs with impunity, branding them as terrorists and exposing them to harm through legal and extra legal means. During the year, women human rights defenders (WHRDs), especially those with intersecting identities that are traditionally persecuted, were particularly affected. 

While indigenous peoples’ rights defenders and those protecting land and environmental rights against corporate and state interests faced heightened risks. Meanwhile, governments extended their extra-territorial reach to target defenders in exile and pursued increasingly sophisticated forms of digital surveillance of defenders and repression of freedom of expression online.

Despite this hostile context, HRDs persisted in challenging governments’ anti-rights
agendas and policies that harm and undermine citizens, while consistently speaking out
alongside the most marginalised communities. Defenders steadfastly countered negative
misinformation campaigns, exposing the increasingly unconvincing narratives depicting
HRDs and their communities as serious security threats.

In several countries, counter-terrorism imperatives were used to justify the restriction of civil society operations and the brutal repression of protests, with security forces using excessive and in some cases lethal force.

Land, indigenous peoples’ and environmental rights defenders consolidated their networks, enhancing collective strategies of resistance, while denouncing companies responsible for human rights and environmental abuses. 

Authorities’ intolerance for those defending economic, social and cultural rights persisted as did impunity for attacks against them. Women, feminists and LGBTIQ+ defenders faced threats, violence and discrimination and dangerous while regressive legislation to criminalise LGBTIQ+ communities was pursued by several governments during the year.

HRDs working in contexts of conflict and crisis faced extreme risks and danger when conducting their human rights work.

After she was let go, she went back home to her mother in Ratnapura, but quickly got tired of the village life. So, she came back to Colombo, using the last bit of her money. To earn money, she danced at different clubs in Colombo. That is when she met her boyfriend. 

For her, unprotected sex and abortions became a norm. But when she got pregnant because of her boyfriend, Uththara decided to keep the baby. But because of their differences, her relationship ended. Then she brought her mother to Colombo, who stuck by her through all her trials and tribulations. 

Now Uththara is a mother herself, navigating the world as she continues her trade as a sex worker, to give a better life for her daughter.

Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja is an internationally respected human rights defender who won the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2022, elected by a jury of ten of the world’s leading human rights NGOs. He has a long history of working to promote human rights in the MENA region and championing the protection of human rights defenders at risk, including working as the MENA Protection Coordinator for Front Line Defenders, serving as President of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) and Founding Director of the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR).

He was arrested on 9 April 2011; and was detained, tortured and subjected to an unfair trial on fabricated charges, that led to him being sentenced to life in prison because of his human rights work. That sentence was deemed arbitrary by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention as far back as 2012.

Throughout his detention, Mr Al-Khawaja has endured various forms of reprisals, including physical and mental torture. 

We will not rest in calling for his freedom.

1,"Kamal Shrimp Farm in Wilathawa, Chilaw is a leading shrimp exporter with a farm that sprawls over 2 acres. The process of raising larvae into shrimp takes roughly 4 to 5 months but is an effort that has a high energy requirement. The shrimp ponds need to be aerated for at least 22 hours a day, which costs the farm over a million rupees each month. UNDP's intervention has provided Kamal Shrimp Farm with the capital to invest in solar aerators. This not only allows the farm to save on costs and increase its profits but also sets the groundwork for transitioning the entire industry towards renewable energy.

Areas such as financial literacy, digital finance, taxation, law will be discussed in the programme. Also the programme will have a rigorous follow up support to ensure that you successfully connect with the entrepreneurial eco system.

11,"In 2022, the 3 most targeted sectors for HRDs were land, environmental and indigenous rights, freedom of assembly and freedom of expression.

🔴 Pervasive levels of impunity combined with limited access to justice enabled ongoing criminalisation, combined with other forms of violent attack, to be used to silence and derail the crucial work of indigenous peoples’, land, territory and environmental rights defenders. These defenders faced persistent and violent attacks as authorities, companies, landowners and farmers sought to further advance their commercial interests through the violent expropriation of land and ancestral territories. 

In the face of expanding extractive, agro-industrial and tourism projects, defenders and their communities were subjected to armed attacks, forced evictions and displacement, destruction of property, stigmatisation, surveillance, criminalisation, enforced disappearances and killings. 

🔴 Journalists and HRDs working on freedom of expression by documenting, collecting evidence of and exposing corruption and human rights violations during protests and in other contexts of serious repression were criminalised and targeted with office raids, intimidation, digital attacks and
surveillance. 

🔴 Around the world new waves of social protest erupted as citizens demonstrated against rising inflation, costs of living and fuel, and poor labour conditions, while also denouncing more fundamental grievances around corrupt and abusive governance. Crackdowns using disproportionate and brutal force were widespread, making the act of peaceful protest increasingly unsafe for demonstrators and defenders. Criminalisation of HRDs who led, mobilised or documented violations occurring in the context of protests was also commonplace during the year.

Protest is foundational to a functioning democracy. It is a tool that can be used to stand up to power and to challenge injustice and oppression.

4,"CEPA’s recent study (https://bit.ly/3NrwFeP) investigates the majoritarian, populist rhetoric which materialised across the country in 2019. The close monitoring of the rhetoric in physical and virtual spaces show that current events have shifted the narrative, especially in relation to the notion of the “common enemy” which has changed from one community against the country to the public vs the state apparatus. This was evident in the mass circumvention of and disregard for the social media ban. In order to understand where we’re headed right now, it is imperative to understand the genesis. We continue to closely monitor the situation for a deeper understanding of what created this shift in the rhetoric and narrative, and the way forward in terms of implications for social cohesion.

The reform or passing of new cybercrime legislation - often on the justification of counter-terrorism imperatives - further restricted one of the few remaining channels for dissent and access to information. This type of legislation enabled provisions ranging from prohibiting VPN use, permitting internet shutdowns, removal of  content critical of authorities, surveillance, censorship, interception of communications, retention of user data and penalties for tech and telecommunications companies that fail to cooperate, among other abusive provisions.

The report details the variety of killings (data from HRD Memorial), risks, threats and attacks faced by HRDs around the world in 2022, and provides examples of HRDs continuing to defend and advance the rights of their communities and societies despite threats to their lives.  

2022 saw a significant increase in killings, threats, and criminilisation of HRDs, but despite an assault on human rights and the rule of law in many countries, human rights defenders showed remarkable courage and persistence in advocating for more democratic, just and inclusive societies in 2022.  

''Across nearly all countries, human rights organisations, networks and social movements pushed back against deepening authoritarianism and closing civic space, mobilising for change while expanding collective voices and responding to the needs of the most marginalised and targeted communities. Even in the most violent contexts, feminist, women and LGBTIQ+ defenders repeatedly stood up for their communities and against discrimination, while strengthening their networks and forming broader alliances. Nevertheless, this steadfast and courageous defence of human rights often came at significant cost to HRDs ''.

The report details the variety of killings (data from HRD Memorial), risks, threats and attacks faced by HRDs around the world in 2022, and provides examples of HRDs continuing to defend and advance the rights of their communities and societies despite threats to their lives.  

2022 saw a significant increase in killings, threats, and criminilisation of HRDs, but despite an assault on human rights and the rule of law in many countries, human rights defenders showed remarkable courage and persistence in advocating for more democratic, just and inclusive societies in 2022.  

''Across nearly all countries, human rights organisations, networks and social movements pushed back against deepening authoritarianism and closing civic space, mobilising for change while expanding collective voices and responding to the needs of the most marginalised and targeted communities. Even in the most violent contexts, feminist, women and LGBTIQ+ defenders repeatedly stood up for their communities and against discrimination, while strengthening their networks and forming broader alliances. Nevertheless, this steadfast and courageous defence of human rights often came at significant cost to HRDs ''.

Presented by Iranian feminist activist, journalist and writer Parvin Ardalan, join us for ''Jin Jian Azadi / Woman Life Freedom: A social vision for human dignity and human rights''

The government’s murder of Jina Amini in September 2022 rocketed Iranian society into a revolutionary moment where women emerged as a symbol of resistance at the intersection of all forms of discrimination. In this paradigm shift, the past and current protest movements are linked together through the celebrated slogan of “Jin Jian Azadi”. 

In her lecture, Parvin will unpack the current revolutionary moment in Iran. How and why did the government’s murder of Jina take us to this particular point? Join us as Parvin discusses the radical potential and meaning of ''Jin, Jian, Azadi'' (Woman, Life, Freedom). She will insist on the entangled relation of the three elements of this slogan and as such will argue that this slogan by linking the everyday and material necessities of life to the abstract notion of ‘rights’ opens a new horizon of feminist politics for Iran, in specific and the human rights discourse in general.

Irish Government should use St. Patrick’s Day diplomacy to urge protection of human rights defenders

Irish Government ministers visiting dozens of countries to mark St. Patrick’s Day should use the opportunity to ensure their counterparts protect human rights defenders (HRDs) and enable them to carry out their peaceful work unhindered, Front Line Defenders said today.

The call comes as Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs dispatches 36 representatives on diplomatic visits to 44 countries to mark Ireland’s national holiday – in what it describes as its “biggest ever” such initiative to promote “Global Ireland”. 

The Irish Government has repeatedly stated that it prioritises HRDs and their protection in its foreign policy. At Front Line Defenders’ biennial Dublin Platform event held at Dublin Castle in October 2022, Jack Chambers, TD, then-Chief Whip and Minister of State for Sport and the Gaeltacht said: “Human Rights Defenders are humanity’s best hope for justice and accountability.” 

Many more HRDs are at constant risk of a wide range of intimidation, including physical and online attacks, smear campaigns and arbitrary detention, as a result of their human rights work. Some are imprisoned unjustly for years on end.

Quote: 
At the forefront of the country’s health battle against COVID-19 are women. The nursing fraternity is dominated by women and a staggering 62% of health and social work jobs are also being held by women (Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, 2016). As indicated by the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, in 2016 more than half of the medical students in Sri Lanka since 2000 have been women and around 70% of students enrolled in paramedics are also women. This is an indication of the level of representation and contribution women make in the battle against the pandemic, and also an indication as to how this important human capital generates return on investment (ROI). 
The most overlooked is the impact on women, an important resource which comprises 51.97% (World Bank, 2018) of the Sri Lankan population.

She is also an environmental and woman human rights defender that contributes to the protection of the rights of the Lao people by highlighting the harms caused by business activities and corruption, as well as calling for solutions to redress this. 

As a result of Muay's human rights work, she was made an example of by the Lao PDR government. She addressed corruption, called out unfair practises by businesses and companies, and denounced the impacts which they had on the Lao people. 

As a result, she is currently imprisoned, facing a sentence of 5 years and a fine of 20 million Kip. Due process and standards were not followed in her pre-trial detention and summary trial.

UNDP provided a deep freezer and a digital scale and conducted a training programme on how to preserve and pack fish for the market, allowing the family to finally earn a profit. Keerthana, a budding seamstress received training through UNDP on how to improve her sewing and marketing skills. This has allowed her to expand her business. Sinthuja makes cement bricks for a living. The knowledge gained through UNDP's workshops has helped improve profits and allowed her family to construct a barrier wall and make much-needed repairs to the house. Priya, a textile shop owner, has expanded her business by utilising her learnings through UNDP's training programme and has now built a new building with proper showcases, and more clothes. 

The Support for Durable Resettlement (SDR) Project supports the resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugee returnees, providing them with durable resettlement opportunities including access to essential basic services, sustainable livelihoods and income generation opportunities. 

The SDR Project is implemented by the United Nations Development Programme - UNDP in Sri Lanka together with the Government of Sri Lanka, with funding from the British High Commission Colombo, across 4 Districts in #Jaffna, #Kilinochchi, #Mullaitivu and #Trincomalee.

Spotlighting Lesbia Artola from #Guatemala, a member of the CCDA (Campesino Committee of the Highlands) in Guatemala. She fights against sexism in all its forms, works to amplify the voices of women human rights defenders and promotes gender equality. Lesbia also fights for men and women’s equal exercise of the right to land, as well as for Campesino rights.

Lesbia has courageously and bravely resisted the extermination of native people in Guatemala, while fighting for access to land and labour rights for Mayan indigenous in Guatemala. Through her human rights work she has consistently been subjected to threats, intimidation and defamation shrouded in misogynistic and racist overtones. 

We call for:

- all charges + lawsuits against Lesbia to be dropped
- authorities to guarantee her protection and safety
- authorities to hold accountable those who are targeting and harassing her for her work

The government of Bahrain, however, imposes restrictions on expression, association, and assembly that violate Bahrain’s international human rights obligations. Elections are neither free nor fair, and opposition voices are systematically excluded and repressed. ''

HRD Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja has systemically been denied urgent medical treatment while in prison, particularly in the last year, punishing him for protesting to ill-treatment in prison. 

Abdulhadi informed his family of gross ill-treatment by prison guards in relation to serious health complications that he is experiencing. on the evening of 28 February, he experienced intense elevated and rapid heart beats, in addition to laboured breathing, and at the insistence of the prison doctor, he was transferred from Jau Prison to the emergency room at the Bahrain Defence Force (BDF) Hospital. The er doctor stated that he must be immediately referred to a cardiologist. However, he was denied access to a cardiologist and was returned back to Jau Prison. While at the hospital, the security forces attempted to place the human rights defender in handcuffs. Abdulhadi has been facing a systematic denial of medical treatment by the Bahraini prison administration. According to reports between January 2022 and April 2022, necessary medical treatment was actively withheld from him by the Bahraini authorities, and access to medical appointments was denied which has resulted in his worsening health. 

We are deeply concerned about his situation:

Hundreds of prisoners, including human rights defenders, have been released since the Iranian judicial system announced that the Iranian Supreme Leader had pardoned 10,000 prisoners in Iran. 

While Front Line Defenders welcomes the release of a number of human rights defenders, we call on the Iranian authorities to release the hundreds of human rights defenders who remain in detention.

පරිසර යුක්ති කේන්ද්‍රය 2022 වසරේදී මෙම දිනයට සහභාගි වෙමින් ආදි වාසී ජනතාවට විශේෂයෙන්ම වැදගත් වන ග්‍රන්ථයක් වශයෙන් නිර්මාණය කළ “වැදි බස” වැදි ජනතාව අතට පත් කිරීමට පියවර ගත්තා. එදා වරිග සභාවේ දී ඉතා වැදගත් යෝජනා ගණනාවක් ඉදිරිපත්ව තිබුණා. ඒ අතර වන සංරක්ෂණ දෙපාර්තමේන්තුව, වනජීවී සංරක්ෂණ දෙපාර්තමේන්තුව හා ප්‍රාදේශීය ලේකම් කාර්යාලය ඇතුළුව ප්‍රදේශයේ රාජ්‍ය ආයතන මැදිහත් ව ආදිවාසී ජනතාවගේ අයිතීන් සහ ජීවත්වීමේදී මතුවී තිබෙන ගැටලු සාකච්ඡා කර, සන්දේශයක් රජයට භාර දීමට කටයු කළා.මෙම යෝජනා රජයට භාර දී ඒ සඳහා විසඳුම් ලබා ගැනීමට වසරක් ඇතුළත බලාපොරොත්තු වන නමුත් අපිට දැනගන්න ලැබී ඇති ආකාරයට ගිය වසරේ දී ඉදිරිපත් වූ යෝජනා සදහා මේ වනතෙක් විසඳුම් ලැබී නොමැති වීම ඔවුන්ගේ අනන්‍යතාවය සදහා ජාතික මට්ටමේ පිළිගැනීමක් නොමැති වීම,ආදිවාසී දරුවන්ගේ අධ්‍යාපන ක්‍රමය තුල ඔවුන්ගේ භාෂාව ප්‍රවර්ධනය සහ භාවිතයට ඇති ඉඩකඩ සීමා වී තිබීම, මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය වැනි හානිකර උවදුරු ආදිවාසී සංස්කෘතිය තුලට ඇතුලු වීම ආදී ගැට¿ විසදීමට රාජ්‍ය මට්ටමේ මැදිහත්වීම අත්‍යාවශ්‍යයි කියල අපි හිතනවා.

මෙවර ආදිවාසී දිනය සමරනු ලබන්නේ දේශගුණික විපර්යාස නිසා ඇති වූ ගැටලු , ආහාර සුරක්ෂිතතාවයක් නොමැති වීම, දැඩි පාරිසරික විනාශයන් වැනි ගැට¿ රාශියක් හමුවේ වන අතර මේවායින් ආදිවාසීන්ට ඇති බලපෑම පිළිබඳව ශ්‍රී ලංකාව අදටත් සලකා බලා නැහැ.

ආදි වාසී ජනතාවගේ ජීවනෝපාය නංවා ගැනීම සඳහා පරිසර යුක්ති කේන්ද්‍රයෙන් පසුගිය කාල වකවානුව තුළ මැදිහත්වීමක් සිදු කළා. ඒ අය වෙනුවෙන් අරමුදලක් පිහිටුවා, ඉදිරි කටයුතු සාර්ථක කර ගැනීම සඳහා චක්‍රීය අරමුදලක් ආරම්භ කර තිබෙනවා.ඒ තුලින් ඉතිරි කිරීමේ වැඩසටහනක් සකස් වනවා. ඒ වගේම, ආදිවාසී සංස්කෘතිය මෙන්ම භාෂාව ප්‍රවර්ධනයට පරිසර යුක්ති කේන්ද්‍රය විවිධ මට්ටම් වලින් දායක වෙලා තිබෙනවා.

මේ ප්‍රදේශයට ඇතිවී තිබෙන තර්ජන අතර වන විනාශය පෙන්වා දිය හැකියි. පරිසර යුක්ති කේන්ද්‍රය මේ වෙනුවෙන් මැදිහත් වී තිබෙනවා. පොල්ලෙබැද්ද ප්‍රදේශයේ, “ගල්වල යාය “ රක්ෂිතය විනාශ කර අක්කර 1500 ට වඩා වැඩි ඉඩම් ප්‍රමාණයක බඩ ඉරිඟු වගා කිරීමට ගත් උත්සාහය පරාජය කිරීමට මැදිහත් වෙමින්, නීතිමය ක්‍රියාමාර්ග පවා ගැනීමට සිදු වූ බව පෙන්වා දිය යුතුයි. ඉඩම් ලබාදීමට මැදිහත්ව තිබුණේ ශ්‍රී ලංකා මහවැලි අධිකාරිය මගින්.මෙම වන විනාශය නැති වූවත්, ප්‍රදේශයට ජලය සපයන ජල මූලාශ්‍රයක් වන ‘රඹකැන් ඔය’ අද ජනතාවට ජලය පරිහරණයට පවා සුදුසු නැති තත්වයට පත්ව තිබෙන බව දිලෙන මහතා පෙන්වා දෙයි.

ආදිවාසී ජනතාවගේ අනාගතය වෙනුවෙන් බොහෝ දේ සිදුවිය යුතුව ඇත. මේ
වෙනුවෙන් රාජ්‍ය මැදිහත්වීම දැනට වඩා අවශ්‍ය වන බව පෙන්වා දෙමු. එම නිසා මෙම ආදිවාසී දිනය හුදෙක් උත්සවයකට පමණක් සීමා නොකොට ඔවුන්ගේ ගැට¿ සඳහා නිසි විසඳුම් ලබාදීමට වේදිකාවක් කර ගන්නා මෙන් වගකිව යුතු ආයතනවලින් ඉතා ඕනෑකමින් යුතුව ඉල්ලා සිටින්නෙමු.

Five human rights defenders are bringing legal action over the infiltration of social + labour movements by a police officer from the Spanish National Police Corps in Barcelona. The under cover officer in question used intimate, sexual relationships, to create and consolidate a bond of trust with those movements.   His actions were endorsed and backed up by the rest of the police. Thanks to an investigation conducted by the newspaper, La Directa, the officer’s activity was documented from May 2020 to October 2022. It is essential to expose, name, and challenge this type of police strategy, integrated into a state policy, as well as the specific gender-based violence it entails, in order to demand truth, justice, reparation and, above all, prevent these events from happening again. 

Front Line Defenders joins over 80 organisations in calling out the Spanish state and police for the violation of fundamental rights, and exploiting intimate and sexual relationships to monitor political dissident.

4,"Hoof trimming is an important aspect of intensive dairy cow management. The functional life of dairy cows can be extended through proper hoof trimming and claw care. When cows have properly trimmed hooves, they are generally healthier and happier, leading to higher milk production. In addition, it will result in a reduction of lameness and will prevent laminitis and foot rot. The USDA-funded Market Oriented Dairy (MOD) Project in Sri Lanka, implemented by IESC, identified hoof trimming as an essential area in which skills were lacking in the country. To help address this gap, IESC fielded an international hoof trimming volunteer expert, Pieter Kloosterman, to visit large dairy farms, assess their current hoof trimming practices, and deliver hands-on training to improve knowledge and skills. Mr. Kloosterman trained 30 farm workers on three large farms. IESC plans to build on these workshops by establishing a hoof trimming certificate course for the Department of Animal Production and Health.",1673366430,0,IESC,2023-01-10T16:00:30.000Z

I think freedom is a journey rather than a place where we can reach or something that we can achieve. Frames are something we put on ourselves. Living in these frames or breaking them and coming out of them is a decision. That's our responsibility.

சுதந்திரம் என்பது நாம் அடையக்கூடிய இடத்தை விட ஒரு வகையான பயணம் என்று நான் நினைக்கிறேன். frames என்பது நமக்கு நாமே போட்டுக்கொள்ளும் ஒன்று. அவற்றை உடைப்பது நமது கடமை. ஆனால் விழிப்புணர்வுடன் செய்ய வேண்டிய ஒன்று.

මාධ්‍ය නිවේදනය

වසර 50කට අධික කාලයක් ගල්ගමුව ප්‍රදේශයේ නිජ බිම කර ගත් “චණ්ඩි” නමැති තනි දළ ඇතා මේ වන විට ගල්ගමුව - ඇහැටුවැව ප්‍රදේශයෙන් වෙනත් ස්ථානයකට රැගෙන යාම නිසා මෙම සත්වයාට සිදුවිය හැකි අනතුර පෙන්වා දෙමින් එසේ කටයුතු සිදු නොකරන ලෙස බලකරමින් පරිසර යුක්ති කේන්ද්‍රය , එහි ජ්‍යෙෂ්ඨ උපදේශක හේමන්ත විතානගේ සහ විධායක අධ්‍යක්ෂ දිලෙන පාත්‍රාගොඩ යන අය විසින් අද දින (07) එන්තරවාසියක් (LOD) යොමු කර ඇත. 

මෙම එන්තරවාසිය වන ජීවී හා වන සංරක්ෂණ අමාත්‍යතුමියට හා වනජීවී සංරක්ෂණ දෙපාර්තමේන්තුවේ අධ්‍යක්ෂ ජනරාල් වරයාට යොමු කර ඇත.

2009 වසරේදී ප්‍රථම වරට චන්ඩි ව අල්ලා බැඳ දමා ට්‍රක් රථයකින් සෝමාවතිය ජාතික වනෝද්‍යානයට ගෙන ගොස් නිදහස් කළ අතර, ඔබ කවුරුත් දන්නා පරිදි එදා අල්ලා ගැනීමේදී චන්ඩිට GPS කොලරයක් දමා ඇත. සෝමාවතියට මුදා හැරීමෙන් අනතුරුව චන්ඩි උද්‍යානයෙන් පිටව කලබල ඇති කරමින් නැවතත් දින 28 කින් කිලෝමීටර් 243 ක් දුර ගෙවා තම නිජබිම වන ගල්ගමුව වන පෙදෙසට පැමිණියේය. මෙම සත්වයා වසර ගණනාවක් එහි ජීවත් වූයේ සුළු ගැටලු මධ්‍යයේය. 2015 වසරේදී නැවතත් චන්ඩිව අල්ලා හොරොව්පොතාන අලි , ඇතුන් රැදවුම් මධ්‍යස්ථානයට රැගෙන එන විට පෙරදී පැළදවූ GPS කොළරය නොතිබිණි. 

මෙම අවස්ථාවේදී ද මාස කීපයකට පසු රැඳවුම් භූමියෙන් මිදී, නැවත ගල්ගමුව වන පෙදෙසට පැමිණියේය. එහිදී නැවතත් සුපුරුදු පරිදි වසර ගණනාවක් වාසය කළේය. 

තවද, 2019 දී චන්ඩි නැවත වරක් අල්ලාගෙන හොරොව්පතාන අලි, ඇතුන් රැදවුම් මධ්‍යස්ථානයට රැගෙන ගිය අතර, ඒ GPS කොලරය සහිතවය. නැවතත් හොරොව්පතානේ අලි , ඇතුන් රැඳවුම් මධ්‍යස්ථානයෙන් මිදී ගල්ගමුවට පැමිණෙන අතරමගදී ගැටුම්කාරී සිදුවීම් රැසකට සම්බන්ධ වූ චන්ඩි, හොරොව්පතාන අවට අනෙකුත් අලි - ඇතුන් සමඟ ගැටුම් ඇති කර ගන්නා ලදී. එතැන් සිට සුපුරුදු පරිදි සුළු ගැටුම් සහිතව ගල්ගමුවේ ජීවත් විය. කෙසේ වෙතත්, පෙර ප්‍රතිස්ථාපන වලින් පසු චන්ඩිගේ සෞඛ්‍ය තත්වය විශාල ලෙස වෙනස් වී ඇත. දැන් වෙන කවරදාටත් වඩා අවදානමට ලක්ව ඇති චන්ඩි, ඇස් දෙකේම පෙනීම නැති වී , වයසට ගොස් ඉතා අසරණ තත්වයට පත්ව ඇත.

අන්ධ සහ රෝගාතුර වූ අලියෙකු වන චන්ඩිව වෙනත් ස්ථානයකට රැගෙන යාමෙන් දැඩි ආතතියකට නිරාවරණය වන අතර, ආගන්තුක පරිසරයක දී වේදනාකාරී හා අකල් මරණයකට මුහුණ පානු ඇත. එපමණක් නොව,

""They are supporting us with making dry fish, cleaning, fixing, and bait preparing.”
 Some of the fishermen who we met in North, Sri Lanka
Women’s role in fishery industries has been identified as a supportive role for men from the histories.  IS IT SO? 
The fishery women that we met at Kottadi village in Point Pedro, Jaffna are mostly engaging in bait preparing ( தூண்டில் கட்டுதல்) for fishing nets. In this process, their service is taken from the boat owners and sometimes their husbands if they own a fishing boat.
They are paid Rs 2,000 per fishing net box if they clean the fishing net by removing the waste baits and fixing the treads and needles. Apart from that if they do the baiting, they are paid Rs 3,000 for one fishing net box. The fishery women come into the bait preparation site and usually, it takes 4 to five 5 hours to finish one box.

JOINT STATEMENT - FRONT LINE DEFENDERS, FORUM-ASIA, and ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights 

Two years after the Myanmar military launched a coup on 1 February 2021, civil society organizations strongly condemn the ongoing human rights violations, and call for accountability and the restoration of a legitimate government. The attempted coup breached Myanmar’s constitution and international law, and was met with massive and largely spontaneous protests that illustrated the lack of meaningful support for the junta among the people of Myanmar. To date, sustained opposition among the population has denied the junta full control over the country, despite an escalation in brutality. There are many well-documented cases of the military committing atrocities, including strong evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

In this context, human rights defenders are more vulnerable because of their work and their visibility, and their safety in both Myanmar and neighboring countries continues to deteriorate.

JOINT STATEMENT: 

On International Women Human Rights Defenders Day, Front Line Defenders and others express concern about ongoing detention of WHRD Li Yuhan who has been detained since October 2017, and remains so indefinitely. Li Yuhan is a veteran human rights lawyer who started practising in the 1990s. One of her cases included that of Wang Yu, one of the most prominent lawyers arrested in the “709 crackdown” - a mass arrest of human rights lawyers and other activists in 2015. The arrest of Li was regarded as retaliation for her involvement in Wang Yu’s and other cases. and other sensitive cases. Li Yuhan has been detained in Shenyang City, the capital of the Northeastern province of Liaoning since October 2017. Although her case was tried last year, there is still no verdict and her release date remains unknown. We call for all charges against Li Yuhan to be dropped and release her immediately and unconditionally.

එසේම 42 වගන්තියෙහි VIII උපලේඛනය යටතේද කඩොලාන විශේෂ කිහිපයක් ආරක්‍ෂිත ශාක ලෙස නම් කර ඇති අතර එලෙස අරක්ෂිත ලෙස ප්‍රකාශයට පත් කර නොමැති කඩොලාන සියල්ලම වන සංරක්ෂණ ආඥා පනතේ 20 වන වගන්තිය යටතේ ආරක්‍ෂිත තත්වයට පත් වන්නේය.

තවද 1981 අංක 57 දරණ වෙරළ සංරක්ෂණ සහ වෙරළ සම්පත් කළමනාකරණය කිරීම පනතෙහි 22 ඈ (22 D) ප්‍රතිපාදනය යටතේද අමාත්‍යවරයාට ගැසට් නිවේදනයක් මගින් “සංරක්ෂිත ප්‍රදේශ” ලෙස යම් භුමි ප්‍රදේශයක් නම් කිරීමට හැකියාව පවතින අතර 1996 අංක 02 දරණ ධීවර සහ ජලජ සම්පත් පනතෙහි 36 වගන්තිය යටතේද කඩොලාන පද්ධතීන් සුරක්ෂණය කිරීමට පියවර ගත හැකිය.නමුදු ශ්‍රී ලංකාව තුල එවන් ක්‍රියාත්මකභාවයක් සිදුව නොමැත.

කඩොලාන පද්ධතීන් ගෝලීය වශයෙන් සුරක්ෂණය කිරීම සමබන්ධව the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF), Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention), Convention for the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage, and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals යන ප්‍රඥප්තීන් තම දායකත්වය සපයනු ලැබේ.

කඩොලාන සම්බන්ධ නෛතික රාමුව මෙලෙස පවතින පසුබිමක් තුල වර්තමානය තුල කඩොලාන ශාක ප්‍රජාවෙහි පැවැත්ම ඉතා අවධානම් සහගත තත්වයකට පත්ව ඇත්තේ මානව ක්‍රියාකාරකම්හි තවත් ප්‍රතිපලයක් ලෙස බවත් මිනිසා තම ක්‍රියාකාරකම්හි  අතීතය ,වර්තමානය හා ඒ හා සබැදි අනාගතය පිලිබඳ  විචක්ෂණශිලිව  විමසිය යුතු බව සනිටුහන් කල යුත්තේමය.

The 25th of November marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Every year, this day signals the beginning of 16 days of activism against Gender-Based Violence. 

Those working on women’s rights, especially in patriarchal societies, often face push back and resistance for the work they are carrying out. This year, we spotlight the African Girls Empowerment Network, better known as the AGE network, based in Nigeria – a collective working to end violence against women - whether structural, physical, emotional or other. 

In this episode of Rights on The Line, African Girls Empowerment Network AGE networks Matina, Esther and Margeret share the challenges they face in their work, the nuances of advocating for womens rights within a patriarchal society, and their own experiences and stories as women regarding the work they carry out at AGE network in Nigeria.

16,"Joint Statement - India: Human rights organisations call for the release of Khurram Parvez after one year of arbitrary detention:

''Khurram Parvez, the Coordinator of the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS) and Chairperson of the Asian Federation Against Involuntary Disappearances (AFAD), has been a champion of human rights advocacy, documentation, and investigations including in the Jammu and Kashmir region, for over 20 years. 

On November 22, 2021, India’s counterterrorism body, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), raided Parvez’s home and office for approximately 14 hours, seizing his and his family members’ laptop, mobile phone, and books. He was then called in for questioning at the NIA office where he was arrested on the basis of a First Information Report lodged by the NIA on November 6, 2021. The arrest memo stated that Parvez was being charged under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), India’s abusive counterterrorism law, which makes release on bail difficult. 

Parvez has now been in detention for one year. His arbitrary detention is part of a longstanding list of human rights violations committed by Indian authorities against human rights defenders, civil society organisations, journalists, and activists in Jammu and Kashmir. Rather than working towards accountability for these violations, authorities have targeted and arrested those who have exposed and sought justice for such violations.  ''

16,"NEW STATEMENT: #Bahrain

Front Line Defenders  is deeply concerned by a series of new criminal charges being tabled against leading HRD Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, which appear to be a direct reprisal against Abdulhadi for speaking out in prison.

Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja is an internationally respected human rights defender who won the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2022, elected by a Jury of ten of the world’s leading human rights NGOs. In 2011 he was detained, tortured and subjected to an unfair trial on fabricated charges that led to him being sentenced to life in prison because of his human rights activities. That sentence was deemed arbitrary by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention as far back as 2012. He is also a dual Danish-Bahraini citizen. 

In recent weeks, Front Line Defenders has been informed of a series of new criminal charges being tabled against the human rights defender. These new charges appear to be a direct reprisal against Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja for his continued determination to speak out in the face of injustice and mistreatment at Jau prison.

The first of the new charges concerns an incident in November 2021 when Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja was denied his right to telephone calls with his daughters. He is charged with breaking a plastic chair and “verbally insulting” a prison official. At the time, Al-Khawaja undertook a hunger strike in response to the denial of his right to telephone calls, and the telephone calls were later reinstated.

To help them adapt to this combination of hardships, IESC’s USDA-funded Market-Oriented Dairy (MOD) project guided and mentored many cultivators to adopt organic fertilizer options to lower their fertilizer costs and maintain their businesses. An added benefit to this pivot towards more organic fertilizers is a greener practice that is better for soil health in the long run. Using a higher concentration of organic fertilizers, 13 cultivators working with MOD grew 161 hectares of fodder and increased their incomes. In the case of one cultivator, Mr. Dushmantha, his fertilizer costs fell by over 80 percent when he switched to purely organic options and the market price for his crops increased by 25 percent. Through MOD, IESC and its partners have commissioned a research study to optimize the incorporation of organic fertilizers in fodder cultivation to spread the practice, improve soil health, and increase earnings for cultivators.",1670340015,0,IESC,2022-12-06T15:20:15.000Z

20,"''Several organizations express their deep concern at the risk of refoulement of an Algerian asylum seeker - Zakaria Hannache - present in Tunisia since August 2022. Tunisian authorities must under no circumstances repeat the dangerous precedent set by the kidnapping and refoulement of Algerian refugee Slimane Bouhafs on 25 August, 2021, about which no investigation has been opened to date in Tunisia.

Mr. Zakaria Hannache is an Algerian human rights defender, who has been prosecuted in Algeria since February 2022 under spurious charges, including charges of “apology of terrorism” and “undermining national unity”, for which he faces up to 35 years in prison, solely for exercising his freedom of expression through his work publishing information and documenting the arrests of prisoners of conscience.

After spending several weeks in prison in Algeria and then being granted provisional release in March 2022, Mr. Hannache continued to be subject to significant intimidation and pressure in Algeria, following which he came to Tunisia, in August 2022. On 9 November, Mr. Hannache was informed that he was summoned to the court of Sidi M'hamed, in Algiers, for a hearing as part of his trial. The hearing was postponed indefinitely and could now be scheduled at any point.

Multiple international human rights organizations, as well as several United Nations Special Procedures, have highlighted the excessively vague nature of the Algerian Penal Code, threatening the right to a fair trial and the proper functioning of justice. Anti-terrorist legislation has notably been used arbitrarily and almost systematically since 2021 to target peaceful activists and journalists.

18,"Interested in abortion rights?

Join us at the Dublin Arts and Human Rights Festival on the 18th October at 7pm online - My Body My Choice: Abortion Rights Activism Across the Globe.

 The Repeal movement was one of the most important political and social movements in Irish history. It involved tens of thousands of activists from every corner of the island making the case for women to be allowed to make decisions for themselves, about their own bodies, their own health and well-being.

As we enter the final stages of the Government’s Abortion Review, we want to explore the challenges that remain since Repeal and hear how the struggle to widen access across the island of Ireland is part of a global movement for women and pregnant people’s reproductive rights.

Join us to hear from brave human rights defenders who are persecuted for their work on abortion access in Poland. Join us to learn how you can be part of the campaign for abortion rights at home.

This event features guest speakers Ailbhe Smyth,  Emma Campbell and Justyna Wydrzyńska. Ailbhe Smyth is  long-time feminist,  LGBTQ+ campaigner and the former founding head of Women’s Studies at UCD. Ailbhe co-founded and led the Coalition to Repeal the 8th, and was co-Director of Together for Yes, the national Civil Society Campaign to remove the 8th Amendment from the Irish constitution. Emma is co-convenor of Alliance for Choice and a core campaigner since 2011, helping secure decriminalisation of abortion as a part of the movement. 

Justyna Wydrzyńska is woman human rights defender and founder of the website Women on the Net, Poland’s first online forum supporting women seeking safe abortions, contraception or sex education. She currently works with Abortion Dream Team (ADT), a grass roots initiative of four women human rights defenders who came together in October 2016 with the goal of providing direct and immediate assistance to women who needed abortions.

Joint Statement: We urge the UN Human Rights Council  to hold a special session on Iran urgently - to independently investigate, report and hold accountable the grave violations of human rights under international law amidst protests and crackdowns on WHRDs. 

The recent protests were sparked by outrage at the death in custody of Mahsa (Jina) Amini, a 22 year old woman from the Kurdish minority, on 16 September 2022 days after being arrested by the ""morality"" police for not complying with the country's discriminatory and abusive compulsory veiling laws, which perpetuate violence against women and girls in Iran and strip them of their right to dignity and bodily autonomy. The focus of the protests has since quickly expanded to broader grievances and encompassed demands for fundamental political and social change towards protection and fulfillment of human rights. 

The United Nations Human Rights Council should act as a matter of urgency by holding a special session and -- given the gravity of crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed in Iran and the prevailing systemic impunity -- establish an independent, investigative, reporting and accountability mechanism.

23,"Front Line Defenders is deeply concerned about the two-year detention, conviction and judicial harassment of the human rights defender Tony Germain Nkina. We believe that he is being targeted solely as a result of his past peaceful and legitimate work in defence of human rights.

13 October 2022 marks two years of his detention. On 13 October 2020, he was arrested without a warrant in Kabarore where he was visiting a client for his professional work as a lawyer.

Tony Nkina is a well known human rights lawyer in Kayanza province who provides legal assistance to detained persons and victims of human rights abuses. He is the former representative of the Association for the Protection of Human Rights and Detained Persons (Association pour la protection des droits humains et des personnes détenues, APRODH), a leading human rights group in Burundi until 2015. In 2015 the government suspended the organization as part of a crackdown on independent civil society.

In June 2021, a court in Kayanza found Tony Nkina guilty of collaboration with armed groups – a common accusation against perceived opponents and critics in Burundi – and sentenced him to five years in prison. The human rights defender’s lawyer immediately filed an appeal the Court of Appeal of Ngozi on 16 July 2021. His lawyer reports that Tony Germain Nkina was questioned regarding APRODH. The human rights defender and lawyer was found guilty of complicity with armed groups and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and a fine of one million Burundian francs. 

 Front Line Defenders call on the Burundian authorities to quash the sentence upheld by the appeal court of Ngozi and unconditionally release Tony Germain Nkina. We  encourage the Burundian authorities to guarantee in all circumstances that all human rights defenders in Burundi are able to carry out their legitimate human rights activities without fear of reprisals and free of all restrictions.",1665679277,0,Front Line Defenders,2022-10-13T16:41:17.000Z

2,"This Global Entrepreneurship Week, IESC highlights the USAID-funded youth employment and entrepreneurship project, YouLead’s, completion of 276 separate village-level Entrepreneurship Development training programs in collaboration with the Department of Samurdhi Development, Sri Lanka's poverty alleviation agency. The programs reached 13,647 micro and small business owners, providing them with entrepreneurship skills and enabling them to launch or improve their businesses.
 
""With COVID related travel restrictions, I realized that I had to build my customer base online,"" says Ayo Fashions' owner, 31-year-old Gayani, a determined young micro entrepreneur from Padiyathalawa. Gayani was one of the participants who attended the Entrepreneurship Development (ED) training sessions, which focused on self-employment and microenterprise development. After two years, Gayani wanted to take her business to the next level and improve her understanding of costing, financial management, branding, and marketing, prompting her to enroll in YouLead's ED training program. After completing her training, Gayani registered her business and sourced clothing tags with the brand name. The training provided her with tips and tools to improve her online presence and marketing efforts. As a result, Gayani's micro-business thrived despite COVID and Sri Lanka's socio-economic upheaval.

Global Entrepreneurship Week celebrates and empowers entrepreneurs around the world – especially those individuals who face structural barriers. Through the ED training sessions, IESC supported micro-business owners like Gayani. As a result, they push the boundaries of conventional business thinking, adopt new skills to meet current economic challenges, and are better equipped to sustain their businesses in the long term. YouLead recognizes the importance of developing rural women entrepreneurs and the vital role they can play in uplifting their families and contributing to the national economy. #GEW2022",1668699024,0,IESC,2022-11-17T15:30:24.000Z

Join us at this exclusive event at the Dublin Arts and Human Rights Festival.

Land grabs, violent evictions, widespread deforestation and destruction of biodiversity, poor working conditions and more, are just some of the negative impacts of corporate abuse-  companies operating with impunity for their human rights violations – companies that grow and process products that we use everyday in Ireland.

Communities around the world are on the front lines of challenging these companies, but sadly, human rights defenders that dare to speak out on these harmful practices risk dangerous retaliation, harassment, threats, attacks and criminalisation, and even murder.

At this event, two international guests – women human rights defenders Grecia Eugenia Rodríguez Navarro from Mexico, and Bidya Shrestha Maharjan from Nepal -will share the realities of what it is like challenging corporate abuse on the ground. Both are working hard to expose, and prevent, corporate-related human rights abuse in their communities, and have faced backlash for their defence of human rights. The event will also include an exclusive screening of the new Trócaire Documentary ‘Make It Your Business’ – a new short documentary which goes on a journey to explore corporate accountability, meeting experts and human rights activists on the front lines of corporate exploitation and abuse, and how we might improve on this in future. To tackle these injustices, the documentary also explores how we might realise a better future by bringing in new 
rules to protect people and planet, and how ordinary people can stand up and take action.

Housing precariousness has reached an unprecedented scale and worldwide housing is rarely treated as a human right. On the contrary, those people organising and acting to defend and promote this right are often targeted with criminal lawsuits, defamation campaigns and physical attacks.

At this event, we talk to activists at the forefront of housing movements around the world, hear about the obstacles they are facing and the strategies they are using to advance housing rights. 

Panelists include human rights defenders from Cote D’Ivoire, Cape Town, South Africa and Brazil. Yvonne Toba, Cote D’Ivoire is a human rights defender who is well known for her work denouncing corruption, bad governance, impunity and social injustice and is the National Coordinator of Novox Cote d’Ivoire, an organization raising the voice of the voiceless in Cote d’Ivoire by promoting an equal access to justice. Buhle Booi, South Africa,  is the head of political organising at Ndifuna Ukwazi,  an activist organisation and law centre that advocates for access to well-located land and affordable housing for poor and working class families, communities and social movements.  Camila Santos, Brazil, is a woman human rights defender born in a place known as Grota, in the group of favelas that make up the Complexo do Alemão. She is one of the leaders of the fight for housing in the Alemão complex and started to give voice to 1,300 families. In 2015, based on the actions she was already carrying out and the demands of women who arrived, Camila established the collective Women in Action in Alemão (MEAA). Camila was 2021 Front Line Defender’s Award Winner for the Americas.

Joint Statement: we demand an end to the deliberate violence, arrest, threats, and charges against Iranian human rights defenders, journalists, student activists and civil rights actors, especially amongst minority ethnic groups.

Since 18 September 2022, over fifty human rights defenders, in addition to journalists and student activists, have been arrested and arbitrarily detained, some already charged with ""acting against national security"". The death toll around the country is estimated to have gone beyond one hundred according to some human rights organisations and media outlets. According to the Baloch Activists Campaign on 1 October 2022, at least sixty seven protesters have been killed only in Zahedan, Balouchestan province. The arrests and attacks appear to be aimed at punishing and silencing those protesting for human rights, especially women’s rights, and accountability for the death in Morality Police custody of a 22-year-old young woman, Mahsa (Jina) Amini, while enforcing the country’s discriminatory forced veiling laws. In response to this, several human rights groups have called for the Iranian police and authorities to be held accountable.

On 22 September 2022, Frunze District Court in Misnk sentenced woman human rights defender Nasta Loika to another 15 days administrative arrest on “petty hooliganism” charges, a violation under Article 19.1 of the Code of Administrative Offences. On 21 September 2022, her colleagues reported that she was not released from detention. On 7 September 2022, Nasta Loika was already sentenced to 15 days of administrative arrest on the same charges.

Nasta Loika is a prominent Belarusian WHRD working in the field of human rights education. She also addresess repressive “anti-extremist” laws, and advocates for the protection of the migrants and stateless people rights in Belarus. In the summer of 2021, Belarusian authorities shut down the organisation where Nasta Loika previously worked for - Human Constanta - which promoted public interests and joint actions in response to modern challenges in the field of human rights, as a part of an orchestrated attack against the civil society in the country.

On 22 September 2022, Frunze District Court in Misnk sentenced Nasta Loika to another 15-days administrative arrest on “petty hooliganism” charges. She was not present in court, and did not have access to her lawyer, as the court denied the motion to invite  attorney. The only person who was invited to be present during the hearing was a law enforcement officer. According to his testimony, the law enforcement officers were informed about Nasta Loika’s participation in public protests and they needed to question her about her involvement.

Front Line Defenders is gravely concerned about the lack of information on the whereabouts of woman human rights defender Nasta Loika and calls upon the Belarusian authorities to immediately release her from detention. Front Line Defenders believes that the woman human rights defender is being repeatedly targeted for her peaceful human rights work. Her earlier arrest is part of the increasing attacks against Belarus's human rights defenders and civil society by Belarusian authorities.

Dignity, Freedom, and Justice for All

Dr. Sakuntala Kadirgamar
Executive Director
Law and Society Trust

Today, the 10th of December is Human Rights Day and today, as in the past the United Nations, governments, and civil society the world over will commemorate it.

the theme is the danger that we make ritual commemorations and as the day passes, everyone forgets about making this a living reality.

This year, the theme focuses on Dignity, Freedom, and Justice for all and we must ask ourselves what these words mean to us in Sri Lanka today.

Our economy and society have been ravaged by covid and an economic crisis that has thrown many people into poverty and the prospects of recovery are uncertain if not bleak. Our government is focusing on balancing the books and on economic indicators but less attention is paid to human development indicators. There is a rise in malnutrition, food insecurity, and the prospects of children ruined through disruptions in education.

Covid has provided the cover for governments the world over to clamp down on civil rights, freedoms of movement, association, and even free speech where people criticized government responses to covid.

In Sri Lanka, we continue to struggle against the Prevention of Terrorism Act – a draconian law enabling arbitrary arrests and detention for alleged terrorist activities that are vaguely defined. It has been arbitrarily used against minorities and is now expanded for use against political opponents of governments.

Justice for all remains elusive in Sri Lanka where the Rule of Law does not operate. Those with political power and patronage enjoy impunity and are not held accountable for corruption, abuse of power, and even murder. Post-war claims for accountability for war crimes, information on missing persons, and restitution of lands and livelihoods remain unaddressed.

We must ask ourselves: Are we committed to ensuring Dignity, Freedom, and Justice for All in the coming year or will this be another ritual commemoration?

In a January 2021 phone call, the human rights defender listed four concerns including that prison authorities had placed restrictions on his phone calls with family (that have replaced their in-person visits) and had confiscated hundreds of his books and other materials. The defender continues to suffer from chronic pain as a result of the mistreatment he endured in the early days of his detention, and requires additional medical intervention as his facial bone structure remains permanently damaged. Prison authorities continue to arbitrarily deny him adequate healthcare and refuse to refer him to specialists for the surgeries he requires. Denying a prisoner needed medical care violates the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, known as the Nelson Mandela Rules. 

We urgently call on the #Bahrain government to #FreeAlKhawaja and support the call of the Danish government to free him immediately.

The dialogue included a group of 32 stakeholders, including relevant government and ministry representatives, donor agencies, training institutions, employment agencies, and non-governmental and multilateral development partners. the dialogue challenged them to come together to support prospective migrant workers with better information and skills. As priority next steps, the dialogue identified the need to strengthen skills certification through the recognition of prior learning (RPL) process, to implement key policy recommendations related to increasing skilled labor migration, and to improve soft skills training opportunities. IESC will hold focused workshops on these areas to develop rapid interventions with stakeholders for implementation. The goals for this collaboration are to improve the quality of and access to information, occupational guidance, and opportunities for skills development for prospective migrant workers in a timely manner, in order to minimize negative impacts and maximize the positive impacts of overseas work. Achieving these goals will ensure that when overseas migrant workers return to Sri Lanka, they do so with skills and knowledge that will contribute to the country’s continued growth.

Following his arrest he required a 4 hour surgery on his face and jaw, injuries that continue to cause him pain 10 years on.

Together with local partner CEDAF and family-owned P&T Valley Farms, IESC celebrated 22 producers for completing their first farmer field school (FFS) in Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) readiness training. This training program ensures the fresh produce exported from DR follows health and food safety regulations required for entrance into US markets through the Produce Safety Alliance (PSA) Grower Training Course. 

Grower Juan Sanchez expressed the following as a result of his participation in the FFS: “At the Farmer Field School, we learned about the importance of knowing and respecting the pesticide application/harvest intervals for the safety of the consumers of our vegetables. We used to apply pesticides even up to the day before harvest! Now we understand that the type, amount, and when we apply pesticides is critical from a food safety and environmental protection standpoint.” 

Following the FFS, P&T Valley Farms saw a 68% increase in the FSMA Produce Safety Rule knowledge of their producers.

At the training, international experts shared experiences and encouraged the coordination and cooperation of strategic, safe, resilient, and reliable trade through the implementation of the World Customs Organization's and AEO program's Standards to Secure and Facilitate Trade (SAFE) Framework. Additional information regarding Paraguay’s AEO Country Program was shared, which includes buy-in from the five main agricultural trade regulators to adopt the program: the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MIC) in December 2020; the National Anti-Narcotics Secretariat (SENAD) in December 2021; National Plant and Seed Quality and Health Service (SENAVE) in March 2022; National Institute of Food and Nutrition (INAN) in July 2022; and National Directorate of Health Surveillance (DINAVISA) in July 2022. Each of these institutions formally committed to giving detailed preferences to AEO-certified businesses, including guaranteeing that 95 percent of their goods pass through the faster green channel for inspections compared to the overall average of only 34 percent of goods passing through green channel. 

Since the creation of the OEA País program with IESC's support in 2020, several cooperation agencies, such as the European Union (EU), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation (GATF), and Organization of American States (OAS), have expressed great interest in replicating Paraguay’s successes in other regional countries.",1663941794,0,IESC,2022-09-23T14:03:14.000Z

Within his career, he was a great environmental activist who stood along with the Centre for Environmental Justice in many of our environmental struggles, as an advocate, lawyer, as well as a companion. Often, his moral support encouraged us to pursue our environmental advocacy. The most recent engagement was saving the farmlands of Rideemaliyadda from the proposed 65,000-acre sugarcane factory project. At the very last moment, he guided CEJ on measures to be taken, and that very decision saved farmers from losing their lands. His good deeds will be his blessing and wealth, which he will carry with him.

IESC volunteer experts conducted dairy market research for Shambani Milk, a Tanzanian dairy company. With the informative market research data collected on consumer preferences for types of dairy products, packaging, and price, Shambani Milk will now be able to introduce new dairy products in Tanzania. Absalom Mwajpaja, an AINFP Senior Business and Marketing Linkage specialist, said, “This was a very great and successful collaboration among the two USAID-funded programs… for the benefit of our food processors and the whole value chain. This assignment will guide the way to introduce affordable nutritious products... that will help in combating malnutrition in the community.” This is just one example of how IESC supports agribusinesses through fruitful collaborations with other USAID implementing partners.

The short-term and long-term impacts of the disaster on marine flora and fauna, overall ecosystem health, people's livelihoods, food and health security, tourism, our nation's economy etc., are too extensive to realistically quantify. The intricate relationships we as humans have with the Ocean and its resources are beyond measure.  For fisher communities who depend on the oceans directly they are facing multiple simultaneous shocks, with few reassurances to restart their livelihoods. They have little or no access to social protection and are in a dire state.

''No matter how powerful a country is, no matter what security challenges (real or perceived) they may face, the experts rightfully emphasize: ‘There can never be an excuse to disappear people.’ Enforced disappearances are strictly prohibited under international law under any circumstances, and may constitute a crime against humanity when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population.

The Chinese government continues to ignore calls for it to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It has disregarded requests for over nine years by the UN’s Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances to visit the country, including its most recent on 7 January 2022. In the meantime, the number of cases of individuals disappeared presented before the Working Group soared, reaching 214 by 2021, out of which 98 remain outstanding.

UN experts and civil society actors have documented many practices used by the Chinese authorities amounting to enforced disappearance. Some are written into Chinese law, or Chinese Communist Party guidance; others happen outside the scope of China’s own laws. Some target individuals for their actions or speech; others are wielded with the intent to terrorize a particular ethnic or religious community.

It is urgent that the UN, governments, and civil society worldwide press China to end, unequivocally, all forms of enforced disappearance.

Today, we remember these human rights defenders who have been forcibly disappeared and call for action to end disappearances.''",1661868451,0,Front Line Defenders,2022-08-30T14:07:31.000Z

11,"🇨🇳 #China 

Enforced disappearances of HRDs is an increasingly worrying trend in #China. On the International Day of the Disappeared, we urge the international community to take meaningful action to put an end enforced disappearance in China.

Just over five years ago, on 13 August 2017, human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng vanished for the third time. Gao, praised as the ‘Conscience of China’, had long fought for the rights of those who dared to speak out, who belonged to religious minorities, who were evicted from their homes when their land was seized, or who protested against exploitation. For that, he was in and out of prison and separated from his family for nearly a decade. For more than five years, his wife and children have had no idea of his whereabouts, nor even if he is alive.

Gao Zhisheng’s case is severe, and yet represents only the tip of the iceberg: many other activists and lawyers face a similar fate, such as Tang Jitian, disappeared in 2021, tortured, and detained in a secret location. UN experts, including the Working Group on enforced disappearance, have sounded the alarm from as early as 2011 about the use of enforced disappearances against those taking part in China’s human rights movement. 

The Chinese government continues to ignore calls for it to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It has disregarded requests for over nine years by the UN’s Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances to visit the country, including its most recent on 7 January 2022. In the meantime, the number of cases of individuals disappeared presented before the Working Group soared, reaching 214 by 2021, out of which 98 remain outstanding.

Over 90% of unemployed youth in Kenya lack formal vocational or professional skills training, as evidenced by their low engagement in the agriculture sector where the average age of workers is 55. To strengthen opportunities for youth to get involved in the agriculture sector, IESC’s Farmer-to-Farmer (F2F) program in Kenya has partnered with CAP Youth Empowerment Institute (CAP YEI) (CAP-Youth Empowerment Institute Capacity Building). IESC’s specialized volunteer experts have provided training to youth who are interested in working in agriculture on obtaining access to finance to strengthen and grow their agribusiness endeavors. In honor of International Youth Day, the F2F Kenya program is excited to celebrate the growth of CAP YEI’s work and the growth of the next generation of youth in agriculture.

In June 2022, F2F implementers from countries throughout Africa visited CAP YEI’s demonstration farm and met with aspiring youth farmers to learn more about their work.

2,"This International Youth Day, IESC highlights efforts by the USAID-funded youth employment and entrepreneurship project, YouLead, to ramp up skills in the solar technician trade. The Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) estimates that at least 10,000 new solar technicians will be needed to meet the government’s targets and growing demand for solar energy solutions. In response to nationwide energy shortages and sharp increases in the cost of energy, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a strategy to generate 70% of the country’s power needs from renewable sources by 2030. YouLead is working with SLSEA and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) on a pilot program to train and find on-the-job placements for 1,200 prospective solar technicians—with up to 70% of participants comprised of youth. IESC trained the first group of 420 prospective solar technicians through a two-day immersion, preparing school leavers for on-the-job training. Each training culminated in a job fair with approximately 100 solar installation companies actively recruiting. Following six months of on-the-job experience, the trainees will be eligible for formal certification. 

International Youth Day showcases the importance of youth engagement to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The launch of the Solar Technicians Training pilot program ties directly to achievement of SDG Goal 7 – improving access to affordable and clean energy. Through this pilot, IESC will ultimately support new employment opportunities for thousands of youth while simultaneously helping to decrease Sri Lanka’s dependence on non-renewable energy sources. #internationalyouthday",1660311912,0,IESC,2022-08-12T13:45:12.000Z

On 18 August 2022, Sri Lankan police used disproportionate force against peaceful protesters in Colombo including tear gas, water cannons and batons. 20 protesters, including human rights defender Chinthaka Rajapaksa and student leader and education rights defender Wasantha Mudalige were arrested from the protest. 16 of those arrested, were released on bail by the Magistrates Court the following day (19 August). Chinthaka Rajapakse was denied bail and remanded until 26 August. Wasantha Mudalige and two other student activists were held in police custody for well over 72 hours without access to lawyers and in violation of their due process rights. They are currently detained under Detention Orders in terms of the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Sri Lankan authorities invoked the PTA, depriving the detainees of basic safeguards, and without recourse to bail, despite appeals against the use of this law against protesters.  

We call for their immediate release and for authorities to respect the right to peaceful protest:

On the morning of 18 August 2022, Israeli security forces raided the offices and confiscated the property of the six Palestinian civil society organisations designated as “terrorist groups” under its Counter Terrorism Law, 2016. Documents, printers and computers were seized and closure orders were issued against the organizations. 

The organisations are Al-Haq Organization مؤسسة الحق  Al-Haq, Addameer Prisoner Support & Human Rights Association  Addameer Prisoners Support and Human Rights Association, Bisan Center for Research & Development  مركز بيسان للبحوث والانماء  Bisan Center for Research and Development, Defense for Children International- Palestine, اتحاد لجان العمل الزراعي (UAWC)  the Union of Agricultural Work Committees (UAWC) and the Union of Palestinian Women’s Committees (UPWC). The offices of the Health Work Committees (HWC) @hwcpal were also raided and closed.

This follows the Israeli government’s move last year to outlaw the six groups designating them as “terrorist” organizations under Israeli law, and as “unlawful associations” under military law, which is applicable in the occupied West Bank. 

Front Line Defenders strongly condemns the raids, closures and the designations of terrorism brought against these Palestinian human rights organisations in response to their peaceful human rights work. Human rights defenders are not terrorists. This development marks a grave expansion of Israel's systematic policies and practices intended to silence Palestinian human rights defenders who seek justice and accountability for violations of Palestinians human rights. 

Front Line Defenders calls on all stakeholders – states, international bodies, corporations and law enforcement authorities to clearly and unequivocally reject the terrorism charges brought against Palestinian human rights organisations and human rights defenders.

17,"STATEMENT:

Front Line Defenders condemns the disbarment of human rights lawyers in #Crimea by #Russian authorities for voicing concerns over the on-going human rights violations in Crimea.

Since Russia’s occupation of Crimea in 2014, authorities have relentlessly persecuted Crimean Tatars and others who have been critical of Russia’s human rights violations on the peninsula. In response to the growing abundance of politically motivated cases against Euromaidan activists, representatives of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People (banned in Russia in 2016), activists from the Ukrainian cultural center and representatives of the Islamic political party Hizb ut-Tahrir, the human rights initiative “Crimean Solidarity” was launched. This initiative supports victims of political persecution by documenting human right violations, providing legal aid, observing trials and supporting victims’ families. Lawyers working on politically motivated cases in Crimea soon became major targets for the authorities, regularly being subjected to harassment, threats, judicial prosecution, office raids, disciplinary penalties and threats of disbarment. On 15 July 2022, the Bar Association of the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation disbarred human rights lawyers Lilia Hemedzhy, Rustem Kyamilev and Nazim Sheikhmambetov. Front Line Defenders condemns the disbarment of the lawyers and the increased targeting against human rights lawyers in Crimea by Russian authorities. 

Front Line Defenders condemns the disbarment of human rights lawyers Lilia Hemedzhy, Rustem Kyamilev and Nazim Sheikhmambetov. It believes that their disbarment is a clear reprisal for their legitimate and peaceful work as human rights lawyers and for voicing concerns over the on-going human rights violations in Crimea. The targeting and systemic persecution of human rights lawyers by the Russian authorities forms part of a worrying trend in Crimea since its annexation in 2014.

Prior to his detention, Pablo spent more than two decades working to ensure that the San Isidro Aloápam community’s rights to a safe environment and access to water were guarded and guaranteed.

As a direct consequence of this work, he made powerful enemies and faced many criminal accusations. On 15 August 2010, he was arbitrarily and violently detained. Following 7 years in detention without trial, and despite testimony and the presentation of evidence that Pablo was elsewhere on the day and time of a shooting he was accused of, and despite there being many inconsistencies and contradictions in the witness' testimony, a judge at the trial found him guilty on trumped up murder charges and sentenced him to 30 years in prison.

And even that didn’t stop the stigma. This eventually made her think about attempting suicide. But she decided to live for her daughters.

6,"At least thirteen Baha’i activists and defenders of the rights to freedom of religion, including human rights defenders Mahvash Sabet, Fariba Kamalabadi and Afif Naemi have remained arbitrarily detained in Tehran, Karaj, Sari, Qazvin and Shiraz since 31 July 2022. During this period, the homes and businesses of 100 Baha’is across Iran have been raided and the thirteen advocates for the rights of the Baha’i community to freedom of religion have been arrested or imprisoned.

In an attack on 2 August 2022, targeting the Baha’i community in Iran, up to 200 Iranian government agents sealed off the village of Roushankouh in Mazandaran province in north Iran where a number of Baha’is live and demolished their houses with heavy machinery. According to BIC, at least six houses were destroyed and over 20 hectares of land were confiscated. Prior to the raid, roads leading to the village were blocked, mobile devices of almost all people present in the village were confiscated and filming was prohibited. Anyone who tried to challenge the agents was arrested.  

Front Line Defenders urges the Iranian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all arrested Baha’i human rights defenders including Mahvash Sabet, Fariba Kamalabadi and Afif Naemi. Additionally, Front Line Defenders urges the authorities to carry out an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into the house raids, demolition of homes and confiscation of properties, including land grab of the members of the Baha’i community, with a view to publishing the results and bringing those responsible to justice in accordance with national and international standards.

It’s time to turn commitments into action. In #Mongolia, human rights defender Sukhgerel is at risk of arrest bc of her NB work protecting the #environment. We stand with her and urge authorities in #Mongolia to support her work! 

Sukhgerel Dugersuren is a Mongolian woman human rights defender who works closely with communities impacted by large scale development projects. She has a long history of exposing human rights abuses and environmental degradation linked to large scale mining, energy and infrastructure projects. She is the Executive Director of Oyu Tolgoi Watch (OT Watch) – a Mongolian NGO monitoring the environmental and human rights impacts of Rio Tinto’s gold and copper mine Oyu Tolgoi – and Director of the Rivers without Boundaries Coalition in Mongolia which helps local communities to protect river ecosystems they depend on. 

On 3 August 2022, during a government briefing, the Minister of Justice and Internal Affairs of Mongolia, H. Nyambaatar, stated that the construction of the power plant had been suspended for two years. On 3 June 2022, an article written by Sukhgerel Dugersuren criticising the Erdeneburen hydroelectric power plant which is planned to be built on the Khovd River in Western Mongolia was published by The Third Pole.1 The article raised concerns about the project, including about the safety of the construction, potential environmental impact given its location in an ecologically sensitive area of Tsambagarav Uul National Park, and the potential displacement of 112 pastoralist households.

 Front Line Defenders condemns the attempt to criminalise Sukhgerel Dugersuren and other human rights defenders in Mongolia. Opposing the negative human rights and environmental impacts of infrastructure, energy and mining projects is not a crime and should not be punished.",1660219384,0,Front Line Defenders,2022-08-11T12:03:04.000Z

The event was attended by representatives from MPI and USAID/Vietnam, as well as more than 100 representatives from ministries, government agencies, representatives of provinces, business associations, businesses, and the media, and was streamed online to hundreds of businesses across the country. 

Apart from learning about powerful tools and materials, workshop participants were introduced to upcoming support programs and discussed digital transformation and access to finance needs and solutions through face-to-face matching and consultations with solution providers, banks, and credit funds. MPI and USAID LinkSME will continue empowering Vietnamese SMEs through digital transformation and access to finance to help SMEs adapt to the new business environment, overcome challenges, and seize market opportunities.

The format of the event is set to be a book reading followed by a question-and-answer session. Voices of Peace (herein referred to as VOP), is an anthology of stories from a sample of twenty combatants from both sides of the conflict. The book published in 2018 contains narratives that highlight the experience and struggles of combatants during and after the war. Sarah’s work of recording narratives with the view of preserving the multifaceted history of the state emulates the principles of memorialisation. 

Further, the socio-political context of the state provides a backdrop in which revisiting the human aspect of ethnic and civil conflict is pertinent if not imperative. The growing tension between communities as well as the developments vis-a-vis international response to human rights in Sri Lanka revitalises the importance of familiarising with the human cost of conflict in order to move towards a more cohesive society.

Duryog Nivaran, Janathakshan and the Centre for Poverty Analysis conduct the official kick-off meetings for the project ‘Revitalising the Disaster Risk Management (DRM) process in the New Normal’

Duryog Nivaran – the South Asia Network for Disaster Mitigation recently received a grant from the South Asia Small Grants Program (SAGSP) which is managed by The Asia Foundation (TAF) to implement a project with its partner organisations Janathakshan and the Centre for Poverty Analysis that aims to revitalize the DRM process in the New Normal.

The project was conceived through the recognition of the need for stronger DRM processes, especially at community level, in the New Normal created as a result of COVID19. In the New Normal, the state and communities will have to build resilience and effective response mechanisms for concurrent disaster situations (floods, droughts, cyclones etc. amidst COVID19 limitations), in order to mitigate both their short-term and long-term impacts. The project looks to empower communities and civil society organizations (CSOs) to take a more active role in DRM processes while also strengthening coordination between such structures and local institutions.

Iran: Meta Must Protect the Iranian #MeToo Movement

A wide network of Iranian women’s rights defenders, feminist activists and public figures, —who are part of Iran’s #MeToo movement and in the diaspora— have come under coordinated attacks from bots and trolls on Instagram in an effort to stifle their freedom of expression and damage their online presence and influence. The huge numbers of fake followers flooding their accounts are part of a sustained, paid campaign.

ARTICLE 19, Access Now, United for Iran and Front Line Defenders urge Meta, Instagram’s parent company, to immediately investigate and eliminate these fake followers and do more to protect the free expression of these human rights defenders, activists and individuals. 
....

Our organisations urge Meta to prioritise its investigations and hold these paid-for troll farms accountable. We are deeply worried by their potential for being hired by actors associated with states such as the Islamic Republic of Iran who would benefit from stifling the voices of these women’s rights defenders.

These fake followers must be investigated and removed. Meta must act swiftly to stop the harms inflicted on Iranian women’s rights defenders, and urgently ensure the protection of their freedom of expression on the platform.

CEPA’s 63rd Open Forum was held on the 16th of February 2021 via Zoom and Facebook Live. The virtual discussion was centred on two studies, by CEPA and Asha Abeyasekera, both looking at ‘life at home’ during COVID-19.

The presenters at the Open Forum were Gayathri Lokuge, Nadhiya Najab and Asha L Abeyasekera, with Madhavie Gunawardena being the discussant and Chandima Arambepola as the moderator.

The forum brought about fruitful discussions and unique perspectives, ending with an array of questions that each presenter got the chance to answer with their expertise and opinions, drawing ideas from the studies they conducted.

The exploratory research study from CEPA looked at how families with young children were faced with the challenges of care responsibilities brought about by the movement restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. Data for the study were collected in two waves, the study was conceptualised and conducted during wave 1, from March to May 2020, and wave 2 was conducted between November and December. Information was gathered through a quantitative survey, shared on social media, to capture the experiences and perspectives of those with access to web-based platforms. The 1st wave saw a response of 466, while the second wave had 81 respondents. At the forum, the focus was the on the quantitative component but there was also a qualitative component to the study during both waves.

CEPA’s Gayathri Lokuge spoke of the gendered nature of COVID-19 related impacts, the tasks divided, and how individuals coped with the shift to remote working and distance learning. With case studies, examples and statistics, Gayathri explained the mental impact, such as the increase in feelings of tension and anxiety, due to the loss of ‘me-time’, for both men and women.

Nadhiya Najab dived a little deeper highlighted the gendered nature of the division of household and childcare responsibilities and distance learning. The ‘COVID push’, Nadhiya explained, is the term used to illustrate the change in participation in household responsibilities, which saw an increase in male participation during the first lockdown in Sri Lanka, in 2020. Nevertheless, with the arrival of the second wave, Nadhiya showed the audience how the division of labour became bigger and the responsibility of childcare fell back greatly on women.

#Ukranian LGBTQI+ defender Olena Schevchenko talks to FLD about her work on the ground amidst the Ukraine war, how HRDs have adapted, and what the current challenges are that they are facing in terms of the LGBTIQ+ community in Ukraine. Olena touches on important aspects such as funding of organisations during a war, how work priorities change, but how discrimination will still be rife even when there is war taking place.

In March 2019, they received a greenhouse facility from the Tanzanian Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Youth Development to unlock the potential of Tanzanian youth in the agriculture sector and address youth unemployment. The Missenyi Youth Group works on optimizing horticultural production and improving the quality of produce in order to increase the income of its members. The F2F volunteer experts trained Missenyi members on compost making, tomato production and agronomy, and soil health management to enhance their skills in sustainable tomato production. The training provided the youth members with techniques to monitor and regulate the soil pH and improve soil organic matter content and fertility, resulting in greater tomato harvests and higher incomes. #WYSD2022",1657892713,0,IESC,2022-07-15T13:45:13.000Z

==================================

ජෛව විවිධත්වය නැවත ගොඩනැගීම සඳහා වන එකඟතාවයන් ක්‍රියාවට නංවමු!
From Agreement to Action: Build Back Biodiversity

ජෛව විවිධත්වය, මිහිතලයේ පවත්නා ජීවයේ පොහොසත්කම සහ විවිධත්වය විස්තර කරනු ලබයි.එය අපගේ ග්‍රහලෝකයේ වඩාත් සංකීර්ණ හා වැදගත් ලක්ෂණයන්ගෙන් එකක් වන අතර ජෛව විවිධත්වය නොමැතිව ජීවය පවත්වා ගත නොහැක. 

ජෛව විවිධත්වය යන පදය 1985 දී නිර්මාණය කරන ලද්දකි. ස්වභාවධර්මයේ විවිධත්වය, ජෛවගෝලය සමඟ කටයුතු කිරීම පදනම් කර ගනිමිනි. ශාක, සතුන් සහ ක්ෂුද්‍ර ජීවීන් විශේෂ අතර විචල්‍යයන් ගැන මෙහි සඳහන් කරයි.

පරිසර යුක්ති කේන්ද්‍රයේ ජ්‍යෙෂ්ඨ උපදේශක මෙන්ම එහි අධ්‍යක්ෂ හේමන්ත විතානගේ මහතාට අනුව,අද වන විට ලෝකයේ ප්‍රධාන පරිසර ගැටලු 03 ක් ඇති බව පෙන්වා දෙයි. ඒ අතරින් ජෛවවිවිධත්වය විනාශ වීම අපගේ ග්‍රහලෝකයේ පැවතිය යුතු සීමාවන් ඉක්මවා ගොස් ඇති බවත් , මෙයට ප්‍රධාන හේතුව මනිසා විසින් අනෙකුත් සතුන්ගේ පරිසර පද්ධති ආක්‍රමණය කරමින් දේශගුණික විපර්යාස වලට හේතුපාදක වන සෙසු සංකූලතාවයන් වන භූමිය හා සමුද්‍ර දූෂණයට හේතුකාරක ක්‍රියාවන්හි යෙදීම බවද ඔහු අවධාරණය කර සිටී.

පසුගිය මස විද්‍යාඥයින් විසින් සහන් කළේ ලෝකයේ ඇති සම්පත්වලින් 70%ක් මිනිසා විසින් ආක්‍රමණය කොට ඇති බවයි. එලෙසම 2020 වසරේදී පරිසර විද්‍යාඥයින් ප්‍රකාශ කළේ වන ජීවීන්ගෙන් 70% ක් ගෙවී ගිය වසර 50 තුළ විනාශ වී ඇති බවයි. එවන් තත්වයක් තුළ 1992 වසරේදී ලෝකයේ එකඟ වූ ජෛවවිවිධත්වය පිළිබද එකඟතාවයන් නිවැරදි ලෙස අනුගමනය කළේ නම් , මේ වන විට ඉහත කී තත්වයන් ඇතිවීමට කිසි සේත් හේතු නොවනු ඇති බව හේමන්ත විතානගේ මහතාගේ මතයයි.

එසේම බහුතරයක් වන ජීවීන්ට අද වන විට ජීවත් වීමේ අවශ්‍යතා සැපයීමට නොහැකි තත්වයකට පත් වී ඇත. සියයට 29 කට වඩා වනාන්තර ප්‍රතිශතයක් ඇති බවට රජයේ ආයතන විසින් ප්‍රකාශ කලද අලි ඇතුන්,රිලවුන් සහ වඳුරන්ද,මොණරුන්ද,දඬුලේනුන් ඇතුලු වන ජීවින් සමඟ මේ වන විට බරපතල අර්බුදයක් හටගෙන ඇත. මේ අර්බුදයට විසඳුම් ලෙස දේශපාලනඥයින් විසින් රිලවුන් චීනයට යැවීමට ක්‍රියා කිරීම වැනි විසඳුම් ලබාදීමට ගෙනෙන යෝජනා ජෛවවිවිධත්ව සම්මුතියට හා අනෙකුත් ජෛවීය සම්මුතීන්වලට එකඟ නොවන ,එමෙන්ම ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ වන ජීවී හා සම්බන්ධ ප්‍රතිපත්තිවලට එකඟ විසඳුම් ද නොවේ.

එම සමුලුවේදී එකඟ වු ඉලක්ක 23 අතරට ලෝකයේ භූමියෙන්,වෙරළෙන් හා මුහුදු වලින් 30%ක් කාර්යක්ෂම ලෙස කළමනාකරණය සහ සංරක්ෂණය කිරීමට එකඟ වීමත්, 30%ක් ගොඩබිම් සහ මුහුදු පරිසර පද්ධතීන් යළි

The WHAM Activity was a five-year project (2017-2022) implemented by IESC that stimulated job creation by advancing BiH’s trade integration with and expansion into the EU and regional markets. WHAM focused on accelerating employment for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the metal processing, wood processing, textile/apparel, and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors.

Through 83 grants and in close cooperation with 335 companies and 67 municipalities, IESC helped SMEs achieve 293 transactions with foreign customers, supported 54 companies to attain 94 new certifications, and supported 60 SMEs to obtain new or upgraded technologies. WHAM-supported SMEs reported an 18.2% increase in sales and an 13.6% increase in exports. IESC also supported the training of 2,657 workers and jobseekers, and the creation of 2,333 new full-time jobs, 33% of which were for women and 60% of which were for young people.

5,"The odds are in favour of what might just be the best prequel ever!🏹

This is a visual masterpiece, to say the least. Francis Lawrence returned as the director for the fifth installment of The Hunger Games franchise, honouring Suzanne Collins’ already perfect world-building.  The creators tow the thin line between both retro and futuristic settings.
 
Rachel Zegler nailed the free-spirited, rebellious musician archetype as Lucy Gray Baird. Tom Blyth played Coriolanus Snow, staying true to Donald Sutherland's version but adding his own flair. Blyth skillfully captured Snow's transition into a power-hungry tyrant. Hunter Schafer, Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage were excellent in their roles as you might already expect.

While the plot holds its own story, we loved picking up on the subtle Easter eggs and callbacks to the original series – if you know, you’ll know. 

Overall, despite the length of the film, it packs action, emotion and moving soundtracks into, in our opinion, one of the best prequel movies ever made - a rather tricky feat for most blockbuster franchises to pull off.

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is now screening at Scope Cinemas. Be sure to check it out on the big screen!

4,"The correlation between poverty and inequality

A common assumption is that when levels of poverty decrease, inequality levels go down as well. This is, however, far from reality as inequality and poverty are two different concepts. The effects of inequality on societies are potentially harmful and is a cause for concern in the long run.

Sri Lanka’s poverty levels have seen a significant reduction. The poverty headcount ratio was at 4.1% in 2016, compared to 15.2% in 2006/7 (Department of Census and Statistics). Despite the decline in income poverty, income inequality continues to remain unchanged. More than half the total household income of the country is enjoyed by the richest 20% in Sri Lanka while the bottom decile (poorest 20%) gets only 5%, with the share of household income being just 1.6% for the poorest 10%.

Supporting small and medium enterprises was central to IESC’s work under WHAM, which helped more than 320 SMEs to attain new certifications, upgrade technologies, increase sales and exports, and find qualified workers to meet labor needs. 

Through a grant provided to the Association of Employers of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, IESC helped young men and women gain the skills needed to obtain meaningful jobs in the textile and footwear industries through practical training with local SMEs. Not only does this support young unemployed people to build their skillsets and find work, but it also supports Bosnian SME employers to find qualified tailors, seamstresses, and assemblers to fill open positions, enabling them to expand production capacities and exports and ultimately hire even more people.

Front Line Defenders is profoundly concerned for the health of prominent human right defender and dual Danish-Bahraini citizen, Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, who is currently serving a life sentence in Bahrain for exercising his rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.

As a direct result of the well-documented torture and mistreatment the human rights defender endured at the hands of the Bahraini authorities1, Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja suffers from a series of chronic and degenerative health problems and requires timely, expert medical treatment. According to recent reports however, between January 2022 and April 2022, necessary medical treatment was actively withheld from the human rights defender by the Bahraini authorities, and access to medical appointments was denied.

A narcissistic view sees “Human Rights” as apolitical; that is, it should be universally conceived, internationally regulated, objectively adjudicated, legally administered, and never instrumentally exploited for particular interests. 

However, it is only in explicit political contexts such as Palestine/Israel, that we can make sense of the goal of “Human Rights” and their defenders – to relieve victims of tyranny, oppression, and persecution.
