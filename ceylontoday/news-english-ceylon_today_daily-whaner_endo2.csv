https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/08/sl-must-pursue-more-ftas/,SL must pursue more FTAs,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-07T20:31:00+00:00,"Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said Sri Lanka’s biggest challenge lies in its “protectionist economy” and highlighted the necessity to pursue Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to foster economic growth and competitiveness.  He also pointed out that there are Free Trade Agreements (FTA) underway with India, Indonesia, China and Singapore, emphasising their importance for national growth and trade expansion and commended the Thailand FTA that was signed recently. According to the Government of Sri Lanka, exports to Thailand are fairly low and were only USD 50 million in 2022 whereas imports from Thailand to Sri Lanka remained at USD 300 million, with a huge trade gap. However, the Government said they should not look for a balance of trade in this context but instead expand trade and they can “increase it to 40 per cent.” What is to be seen is an overall balance of trade, the Government said.   Regarding the visit of Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, Sabry noted the signing of agreements in IT, tourism and fisheries during the official three-day visit, accompanied by a high-level delegation of 21 traders and businessmen, marking a significant development. The Foreign Minister explained the necessity of FTAs for Sri Lanka by highlighting the country’s economic trajectory. He emphasised that Sri Lanka’s export performance has lagged behind that of countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam. In the 1990s, Sri Lanka’s export market was on par with Bangladesh and Vietnam at USD 4 billion. However, by 2022, Vietnam’s exports had surged to USD 373 billion, while Bangladesh reached USD 59 billion, whereas Sri Lanka only stood at USD 14 billion having a GDP of USD 79 billion. In a world market of USD 86 trillion, Sri Lanka is only 0.001, he added. He pointed out that to access that market the model is ASEAN, which uses FTAs. “With FTA instead supplying to 22 million people of Sri Lanka, you expand your market. Building your brands and becoming competitive and becoming able to export on a larger scale is what is needed,” he said.  “Sri Lanka has to do it and had to do it.  We cannot be the prisoners of the past. Under the UN sovereignty principle, we have to work with the world. Our expert panel is negotiating FTAs.”  He said Sri Lanka has signed an FTA with Singapore and this is active at present. He said Thailand is very important to Sri Lanka.   He also noted on 23 February 2024, Sri Lanka will sign the FTA with Indonesia which is expected to be the fourth biggest economy by 2050, with 300 million people.  “We are also planning to sign FTAs with other ASEAN countries,” he added. “We are discussing an FTA with China too and further discussions are underway with India, which has 1.4 billion people and is tipped to be the third biggest economy by 2028. The whole world is there, and we need to come to terms with it,” he said. He said the FTA with India is active and only some trade goods have been limited. “In January, we held discussions to expand the agreement and wanted to conclude the discussion before India goes to polls in March 2024,” added the Minister.  With China, the Government said they held seven rounds of discussions, but in 1918 the discussion stalled. China wanted to restart discussions and Sri Lanka held a virtual meeting with China two months ago. “We resumed talks. We still have some issues on the FTA with China. That is why it stalled. Now in the virtual discussion, China made new suggestions about Customs duty.” On the Singapore FTA, he said, “In 2018, it stalled and the President instructed to implement it and two rounds of talks were held with Singapore. It is active from 2023. The Government held more talks regarding the Customs Tax in January this year.”"

Responding to queries about the NPP’s discussions on National Security with Indian officials instead of with Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister, Sabry highlighted his own interactions with Opposition figures during his recent visit to London, including talks with the Shadow Foreign Secretary of the Labour Party.  The Minister noted it is good to engage in dialogue with both Government and Opposition parties, stressing the significance of India as a neighbouring country and a large market.  He said there is a need for constructive engagement with India, the largest market with 1.2 billion people without resorting to accusations or fear-mongering, characterising. It is good to have dialogue and visit the neighbouring country and it is a positive development, he added."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/07/keheliya-resigns-from-cabinet/,Keheliya Resigns From Cabinet,By Gagani Weerakoon ,0,2024-02-06T20:36:00+00:00,"In a very unlikely move by a Sri Lankan politician, remanded Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, yesterday (6), tendered his resignation from his Cabinet portfolio, thus vacating his post as the Minister of Environment. While it was not immediately known if the decision was made voluntarily or under duress due to increasing criticism against the Government, President Ranil Wickremesinghe immediately accepted the resignation. Subsequently, the gazette notification confirming the resignation of Minister of Environment Keheliya Rambukwella, with effect from 3 February, signed by Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, on orders of the President, was published. Sources from the President’s Office claimed Rambukwella, in his letter of resignation, mentioned that he was taking the decision until he was proven innocent and cleared from all charges pertaining to the ongoing case. Former Health Minister Rambukwella was remanded, till 15 February, by Maligakanda Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrama, after being named the eighth suspect in the ongoing case in connection with the procurement of substandard human immunoglobulin. This follows Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, appearing for the prosecution, accusing the former Health Minister of amending the procurement process that governs the import of medicine and praying the Court to reject bail by naming him a suspect under the Public Property Act. Rambukwella was produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate on Saturday (3). The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested him on Friday (2) in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a Court order. He was grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested. The arrest came amid strong calls by civil society activists and health sector trade unionists for the lawmaker’s arrest. Prior to the arrest of Rambukwella, seven others had been arrested in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in remand custody. Deputy Solicitor General Girihagama alleged that Rambukwella had removed the suppliers registered with the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and enabled unregistered suppliers to enter the procurement process. Submitting a Cabinet Paper, previously tabled by Rambukwella, to the Magistrate, the Deputy Solicitor General pointed out that there was no shortage of human immunoglobulin vaccine at the time when the former Health Minister sought Cabinet approval to make emergency purchases of a list of certain medicinal drugs. She also emphasised that no document was uncovered during the investigations to corroborate the need to prepare the Cabinet Paper in question. The lack of such corroborating evidence reportedly prompted concerns within the Courthouse."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/07/reports-that-online-safety-bill-was-passed-in-violation-of-sc-determination-ill-informed-and-baseless/,Reports that Online Safety Bill was passed in violation of SC determination ill-informed and baseless,Author not found,0,2024-02-06T20:34:00+00:00,"Irked by remarks made by various parties over his ratification of the Online Safety Act, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, issuing a special statement yesterday, pointed out that he has no authority to accept or reject any amendments from anyone, including the Supreme Court, to the Online Safety Act and that the sole authority of such exercise is vested with Parliament. “This statement is issued in the interest of the public, to set the record straight on the passing and the subsequent enactment of the ONLINE SAFETY ACT, No. 9 OF 2024. For the information of the public, the process of enactment is explained from the beginning, to prevent being duped.  When a Bill is presented to Parliament, there is opportunity to challenge it before the Supreme Court in accordance with the Article 121 of the Constitution. According to the provisions of the Constitution, after the Supreme Court considers them, the respective determination is submitted to the Speaker within three weeks. Thereafter, the Speaker should announce the respective determination in Parliament on the first day of the upcoming Parliamentary Sitting, and further order that the complete determination be published in the Hansard on the same day,” Speaker stated. The statement further said: “Following the above process, after presenting the Online Safety Bill to the Parliament on 3 October 2023, the Speaker readout the Supreme Court determination to the Parliament on 7 November 2023 and ordered it to be published in the Hansard Report of the day. Thereafter, it became a public document, that can be accessed by any interested party. According to the determination of the Supreme Court, the relevant Ministry (in this case, the Ministry of Public Security) incorporates the proposed amendments with the aid of the Legal Draftsman’s Department. The incorporation of these amendments is done by the party that presented the Bill, to be consistent with the Constitution, as per the determination of the Supreme Court. The amendments are printed trilingual and distributed to all Members of Parliament in all three languages. The Online Safety Bill followed this same process, and the amendments were distributed to all Members of Parliament in all three languages on the morning of the 23rd of January 2024, which was the first day of debate in respect of the Second Reading of this Bill. The Online Safety Bill was debated for two days and the Committee Stage commenced on the second day, the 24th of January 2024, at 5:00 pm. According to the list of amendments given by the Ministry of Public Security, the Speaker presented each amendment to the House to be passed clause by clause. At that time, the Additional Solicitor General, who was representing the Attorney General in the official box, reserved for government officials in the Parliament, informed the Speaker that all the mandatory amendments in accordance with the determination given by the Supreme Court had been included in the amendments at the time of the Committee Stage. Hon. M. A. Sumanthiran at this stage raised some concerns, and the Speaker requested the Additional Solicitor General to explain further in this regard to the Honourable member, to which the Additional Solicitor General obliged.  After the said amendments were presented and considered at the time of the Committee, the Online Safety Bill was duly passed in Parliament after the Third Reading, as is the process for any bill thus presented. At that time, the Attorney General also issued a certificate that these amendments are in accordance with the Constitution, as guided by the Supreme Court’s determination.  In this whole process, the Speaker has no role or authority to propose, accept or reject any amendment/s and/or recommendation/s suggested by any party, including the Supreme Court, where the sole authority of such exercise is vested with the house of Parliament, i.e. its Members, often with majority vote.  The Speaker is bound by the Articles 79 and 80 of the Constitution to endorse the Certificate on a Bill once it has been duly passed. Accordingly, the Speaker endorsed the Certificate on the Online Safety Bill on 02nd February 2024, making it the ONLINE SAFETY ACT, No. 9 OF 2024. Thus, the office of the Speaker states that the Online Safety Bill was passed by the Parliament in accordance with the Supreme Court’s determination, as was confirmed by the Attorney General’s Department. Since the legislative process of the Parliament takes place jointly with the Attorney General’s Department and the Legal Draftsman’s Department, there is no opportunity to act in a manner that is not in accordance with a Supreme Court determination regarding a Bill or in violation of the Constitution.  Though it is encouraging to see the improvement in conscience of some of the Members whose very conduct warranted the Attorney General’s Department to be present in the final committee stage to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court’s determinations (since the Provincial Councils Elections Amendment Act of 2017), if the members concerned could specifically mention what recommendations were ignored, the respective authorities may be able to respond to such allegations, since the Speaker has no discretion on such matters as explained above. It’s regrettable that those who ought to know this process better are stating otherwise and the insinuation that the Speaker can enact laws and make amendments to Bills at his discretion is an insult to their own legal and constitutional knowledge.  Any Member of Parliament is welcome to come and peruse all the documents and the proceedings of the passing of the ONLINE SAFETY ACT, No. 9 OF 2024, and consult the officials that have the knowledge of the subject to understand things better.  The Speaker’s office would like to remind all Members again that discrediting the House or undermining its credibility will not do one better, as in a democracy, the parts are judged by the whole and not the other way around.” "

Perera,0,2024-02-06T20:33:00+00:00,"Leader of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU), MP Udaya Gammanpila said to prevent a repetition of the former Health Minister’s fiasco, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) should function independently. “This would prevent it from being influenced by the Ministry of Health,” he said. Gammanpila was speaking at a media briefing held at party headquarters yesterday (6). He also highlighted the necessity for the Government and the public to exhibit equal interest in addressing the issues surrounding Minister Keheliya Rambukwella. He underscored the importance of preventive measures over reactive responses, stating, “Prevention is better than cure.” Pointing out the significant role of the Cabinet in approving purchases exceeding Rs 100 million, MP Gammanpila said such transactions require the minister’s submission of detailed information and recommendations and that the procurement of medicines typically exceeds this threshold, indicating the minister’s involvement in the process. Raising concerns regarding the NMRA, which falls under the purview of the Minister of Health, MP Gammanpila highlighted the minister’s authority in appointing the Board of Directors, including the Chairman, thereby claiming a potential conflict of interest. The MP also cautioned against the possibility of Health Ministry officials being swayed by the influence of the minister, especially in matters pertaining to drug regulation and procurement.  To mitigate such risks and ensure the integrity of the regulatory process, MP Gammanpila said the NMRA must function independently."

The government said, on par with one of the budget proposals tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies, it has decided to suspend the charging rental for apartments rented out to low–income families and necessary measures should be taken to grant the legitimate ownership of those housing units to those residing within those units, themselves.  Under various housing programmes, the Urban Development Authority, the National Housing Development Authority and the Urban Civilisation Development Authority have provided houses on lease, instalment -wise ownership, sole ownership and on rent to low–income generating families. Accordingly, the Cabinet has granted approval to the resolution furnished by the Minister of Urban Development and Housing to stop charging rent from all the urban housing units provided on a low monthly rental basis of Rs 3,000 or less to low income generators and take necessary steps to transfer the sole ownership of those housing units to those low income generators."

The Government plans to grant free deeds to 200,000 farming families under the Urumaya programme. Rs 2 billion has been allocated in this year’s Budget proposals to implement the Urumaya programme, and all the land licences granted under the Land Development Ordinance will be converted into freehold deeds and given to the farmers who have cultivated those lands. Speaking on this occasion, the Prime Minister said, “We have reached a historic moment. The anarchy that existed when the country was handed over to Ranil Wickremesinghe is unforgettable. Also, we recall at this time that the President succeeded in resuming the economic operation of the country as well as democracy. He planned to recover the crippled local economy. We spoke fairly when we lost our free country with the rural people who lost the heritage of our country. After the Matale Rebellion, the foreign rulers who came to our country acquired our lands. Subsequently, our self-sufficient economy collapsed. The freedom struggle of our country took the leadership on a journey to rise from the collapse of the economy. It is the transformative moment to bequeath the heritage of lands to 200,000 people once again. Accordingly, all government officials including the Minister of Lands, came together to achieve the goals of the President and fulfilled this great national responsibility, of restoring the lost heritage. The city of Dambulla is historically significant in the world. This land, nurtured by centres like Dambulla and Sigiriya is ideal to hold this function to recollect our heritage today. This is the pride of our land. With the invitation and intervention of the President, villagers started farming again when the country was short of food and ensured self-sufficiency. We transformed the country into 10,000 villages that could be self-sufficient. The country proved that we possess farmers who can create a self-sufficient motherland. It is the responsibility of all of you to strengthen and advance those important tasks that are expected by granting land rights.  Don’t take that deed for granted. On behalf of the Government, we kindly remind you that you all have the responsibility to protect the heritage given to you by the country. We should transform the development of the country evenly from North to South, from East to West to bequeath development from village to village. Many similar programmes were initiated, announced and promised by the President in recent years. Thousands of women who did not have a bank account were added to Sri Lanka’s banking system overnight. More than 100,000 people were provided with welfare assistance through digital technology. This is the programme launched for the safety of your children and your families. This land deed may be a strong weapon for all of you who step into the future of our country. Let’s work together for the unity of all the people and join hands to move the country forward.” A large number of religious leaders led by the Maha Sangha, ministers, State Ministers, MPs, governors, ministerial secretaries including the Secretary to the Prime Minister, provincial secretaries, district secretaries, divisional secretaries, guests and recipients of land deeds were in attendance."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/06/exotic-birds-importer-making-dubious-attempt/,EXOTIC BIRDS IMPORTER MAKING DUBIOUS ATTEMPT,By Gagani Weerakoon ,0,2024-02-05T20:36:00+00:00,"On top of a month-long delay in completing investigation into an exotic bird consignment imported without a valid permit, sources from the Customs and interested parties now allege that the errant importer is now trying to seek other avenues and get the consignment passed by obtaining a permit from the Import Controller. Sri Lanka Customs Spokesperson Seevali Arukgoda said they are in the process of comparing inventory and documents, provided by importer, explaining the delay.  “We hope this investigation will end soon and we’ll be able to take a final decision within next one to two weeks,” he added. Arukgoda, when the consignment was taken into custody, said due to permit issues, the birds were prevented from being released.  The individual responsible for bringing the birds possessed a prior licence for bird importation, but during the previous import, a number smaller than the permissible number of birds was brought in. Arukgoda mentioned that the importer believed he could bring and release another batch of birds with the same licence. However, he clarified that, typically, import permits allow items not brought in the first shipment to be brought in the second, yet, due to the live birds, the Customs decided to conduct further investigations. Arukgoda indicated that the importer was advised to obtain permits again, suspecting potential harm to native Sri Lankan fauna and flora by these birds. The birds were placed under the custody of officials from the Animal Production and Health Department of Mattala Airport.  He emphasised that the birds are being kept in a secure location under the importer’s supervision until the necessary permits for bringing them to Sri Lanka are finalised. Despite Arukgoda’s claim that they kept the bird shipment until the importer provide them with due permit and relevant documents, Director General of Wildlife Chandana Sooriyabandara claimed neither has such request been made so far nor have they the authority to issue such permits post-import.  He in fact, said Customs had not even communicated ‘in anyway’ about an ongoing investigation. If there are any birds that are to be brought down as per the CITES Convention, then such birds are brought down according to a particular procedure. That means if those animals mentioned in the list are to be brought down, then an import licence has to be obtained from us and that has to be sent to the country from where the birds are to be imported. Then after receiving an export licence from there, they will be able to bring down birds to this country. If these animals do not fall under the CITES List, then we are empowered by law to act as per Provisions of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance and issue a licence. Animals could only be brought down only after the issuance of such a licence. They need to obtain a vaccination licence.  Meanwhile, senior environment lawyer Dr. Jagath Gunawardana also said Import Controller does not possess powers to issue permits to an importer of exotic birds or any other fauna. Also, there is no legal provisions to issue retrospective permits."

Abeyratne has stated that 93 per cent of the farmers have been paid for agricultural activities related to Maha Season in the 2023/24.     Accordingly, he has mentioned that the allowance of Rs 15,000 has been credited to the farmers’ accounts for agricultural activities including the purchase of fertiliser in connection with paddy cultivation in the Maha Season.   He also mentioned that the sum was credited to the farmers’ accounts in order to avoid possible irregularities in providing the relief money, but due to the errors in the numbers in some of the farmer accounts and a large swathe of Paddy fields being damaged due to floods, then the money could not be credited on time.    However, despite all the obstacles, he has further mentioned that the amount will be paid to all the accounts within the next two weeks.   Among them, farmers’ associations also allege that fertiliser should be applied to paddy fields two weeks after the start of a new season, but up to now, about 70 per cent of the farmers have not received the subsidy money given by the government to buy fertiliser. Accordingly, they said that some farmers are in dire straits as they are unable to buy fertilisers for their fields and no action has been taken so far. They also said that some farmers’ crops were damaged due to the dry weather in the last Yala season (2022-2023) and about one hundred and twenty thousand acres of cultivated land (Paddy Field) in the Eastern Province were partially damaged due to rain, but, the farmers did not get any relief.    They further said that by failing to provide subsidy money and cultivation compensation provided by the government continuously, the farmers will stay away from cultivation. The Ministry of Agriculture has announced that due to the heavy rains of the past few days, about seven per cent of the paddy fields have been gone under water and that in the Badulla and Nuwara Eliya districts, paddy fields are being planted late in the Mas season and the financial allocations for those have not been paid yet. "

Premajayantha made these remarks while taking part in an event held at Hindu College, Jaffna yesterday (5).  The Minister stated that around 3,000 Advanced Level schools will be digitalised and added that commencing from next month, the teachers for this exercise would be provided with the requite training. Accordingly, all relevant schools will also be provided with smart interactive boards.  He further claimed that computer resource centres situated in all education zones have been updated in parallel to this project.  The Minister opined that despite taking over his Ministry at a time when the country was reeling from a myriad of problems, during the past 18-month period, he has taken many crucial decisions in the education sphere, which would further go a long way towards its revival."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Meanwhile, he said that Suwa Seriya is currently facing a huge crisis due to the difficulty of running an efficient operation without continuous reimbursement of expenses.   He also said the government should reimburse the recurrent expenses incurred for the operations of the Suwa Seriya Foundation, but the amount of 330 million rupees was not reimbursed as of 1 January 2022.    Additionally, it was noted that 25 ambulances, obtained through a finance lease system in 1990, remained parked in the supplier’s lot for over a year-and- a- half without being used. The reason attributed is incomplete infrastructure improvements required to align the services with those offered by the Suwa Seriya Foundation.  Meanwhile, on 27 August 2019, the Cabinet had taken a decision to reduce the financial allocation given by the Ministry of Health to Suwa Seriya Foundation to 25 percent in 2021, 50 per cent in 2022 and 75 per cent in 2023.  Considering the service provided to the people during the Covid-19 crisis in the country, Suva Seriya management has requested the government to change the relevant Cabinet decision and provide funds. Due to budget shortfall in the exchequer, by January 2023, the Board of Management decided to seek corporate and public assistance to support and maintain the 1990 Suwa Seriya Ambulance Service.  The senior officer of Suwa Seriya Foundation mentioned that a suitable mechanism should be established promptly in order to run the institution without hindrance in consultation with the responsible parties in this regard.   He further said that it has become difficult to maintain the Suwa Seriya ambulance service, which has been maintained by the government budget until now, and if the government does not pay attention to this, the Suwa Seriya service will have to be stopped completely. Established in 2016, the Suwa Seriya Foundation’s mission is to prevent accidents, diseases and emergencies, rapidly and effectively respond to emergency situations and aid in the rehabilitation of individuals following illness and injury.  The 1990 ambulance service was inaugurated in Hambantota on 27 July 2016, with generous support from the Government of the Republic of India."

The Court also fixed the case for February 19.  In his petition, filed through Attorney-at-law Shayamali Athukorala, he said that he was recruited to the position of Chief Executive Officer and General Manager on 1 December 2022 on a contract basis for a period of one year to be made permanent thereafter upon review by the board of directors.

In response to the EoI issued on 10 July 2023, four companies applied, including the Russian Private/Holding company Airports of Regions Management. The Indian partner in this joint venture has not been officially disclosed, but it is widely speculated to be the Tata Group. Yesterday (5), Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ports and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra told Ceylon Today  that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture. He emphasised that the process is still in the discussion stage. “Currently, the Request for Proposal (RFP) is under evaluation, and no decisions have been finalised,” he added. Ruwanchandra stated that in three weeks, they will announce the company responsible for managing the 198-hectare airport. The Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation, acting on behalf of Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Limited (AASL), had invited proposals from potential investors for various aviation-related ventures at MRIA. In a letter to the government, Russia’s AR last year highlighted its extensive expertise in airport management and robust connections with Russian airlines. AR expressed its commitment to significantly boost passenger traffic to MRIA and explore new local and international connectivity and income opportunities. The AR group adheres to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) guidelines and prioritises energy efficiency to reduce costs for its customers. The CEO of AR Management of Russia is Evgenity Chudnovskiy. The MARIA has an area in extent of 198 Hectares (489 Acres) which has been reserved for the establishment of the management facilities in total. The Government of Sri Lanka said that the lease agreement will be entered into by the Prospective Operator/Investor with Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Limited, to occupy the land(s) within the segregated zones allocated for each individual venture valid for a period stipulated from the date of Letter of Award (LoA). The government also approved a site visit to MRIA for investors which could be arranged by AASL where Prospective Operator/Investor are expected to familiarise themselves with the local conditions in Hambantota and Airport. The government called for bids to the Maintenance Repair Overhaul (MRO) or MRO Aircraft Spares Manufacturing/Storage Services, Fixed Base Operations (FBO), Long Term Aircraft Parking Support Services. Flying Schools/ Aerospace Engineering Schools and also ground handling. According to inside sources, it is believed that the ground handling is what Tata is interested while the rest of the criteria is to be handled by the Russians.   Minister of Ports and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva said in August last year that the total cost of MRIA construction was USD 244 million (Rs 81 billion at prevailing rates). Of this, USD 190 million (nearly Rs 70bn) was a loan from the Chinese Exim Bank. Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Pvt Ltd (AASL) has been repaying the loan since 2015. About USD 102.4 million (Rs 37.4 billion) remained to be paid as at August 2023."

Speaking to Ceylon Today, Jayakody said that cannabis cultivation is expected to be legalised in Sri Lanka solely for export purposes, in coordination with the Board of Investment and Ayurveda Board, and would attract a large amount of foreign exchange as a result. He also said that both local and international investers with an investment capital of USD 500,000 will be eligible to invest in the cannabis production, once the Cabinet approves the draft paper. The State minister added that the current Ayurveda Act of 1971 has been amended and the necessary legal provisions have been given for the cultivation of medicinal plants and in line with the existing provisions, the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine presented the draft to the Attorney General’s Department.

Dissanayake met India’s External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar and held a productive meeting, with the latter taking to X (formerly known as Twitter) to inform about it. “Pleased to meet @anuradisanayake , Leader of NPP and JVP of Sri Lanka this morning. A good discussion on our bilateral relationship and the mutual benefits from its further deepening. Also spoke about Sri Lanka’s economic challenges and the path ahead,” wrote Jaishankar.  The EAM stressed that New Delhi with its neighbourhood first and SAGAR policies will continue to be a “reliable and trusted partner to Sri Lanka”.  Apart from Dissanayake, senior legislator Vijitha Herath, Secretary Nihal Abeysinghe and Executive Committee member Prof Anil Jayantha are also in the delegation. Dissanayake’s visit assumes importance as the JVP leader helms the National People’s Power [NPP] alliance. His popularity soared during the economic crisis of 2022 when he led the people’s movement which resulted in former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa relinquishing his powers.  Recent survey conducted by the Institute for Health Policy, a Colombo-based research institution, shows that Dissanayake is the most preferred candidate to secure the presidential elections, scheduled to be held later this year.  As many as 50 per cent of respondents in the survey said they will cast the ballot for Dissanayake, followed by Sajith Premadasa (33 per cent) and President Ranil Wickremesinghe (nine per cent). Sensing the tide, the NVP leader has already declared his candidacy for the election. Moreover, Dissanayake taking a pro-India position comes in stark contrast to the stance taken by his party in the late 1980s. The JVP led an anti-India campaign in 1987-90 against the Indo-Lanka Accord that it deemed an expression of “Indian expansionism”. Dissanayake acknowledges the shift in party’s stance and states that any decision that the island nation makes should be done so in keeping view of the impact it has on India.  “We do know that India, who is our closest neighbour, has become a major political and economic Centre. So, when we take economic and political decisions, we will always care about how it will impact India,” Dissanayake was quoted as saying by Indian newspaper The Hindu last year.  When Sri Lanka was staring at an economic collapse and the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) seemed aimless, it was India that stepped in and provided assistance worth USD 3.8 billion. If Dissanayake does come to power, it could help New Delhi have a trusted ally in the south – a proposition that may irk China.    (Agencies) "

One fact that was revealed during the Court hearing was that the master mind behind the Human Immunoglobulin scam was in the Cabinet of Ministers.   Dr. Wijesinghe said that while Rambukwella was put in remand prison, there were more brains involved in the drug scandal which were yet to be uncovered. It is yet to be revealed as to whether they are within the Health Ministry, the National Medicines Drug Authority (NMRA), or elsewhere, he said.   It should be revealed to the nation whether there was someone who protected those involved in the scam, while legal action should be taken against those parties as well. The rulers of the country, the legal system and the Minister of t his country should make an example and try to make it an opportunity to work so that such a situation does not occur in the future. “The integrity of this government has been severely tested and therefore with the pressure applied by the health service trade unions and civil organisations the Government was compelled to prove its honesty by taking legal action against one of its own Cabinet Ministers,” the GMOA Media Committee Member observed.   Dr. Wijesinghe noted that one of the salient points which had been noted during the Court hearings was that emergency purchasing had paved the way for the corruption that took place. With emergency purchasing that was carried out during 2022 to mid 2023 all normal procurement procedures were inactive. He accused Rambukwella of having said at the end of 2022 that emergency purchasing would be stopped in six months. However, as Health Minister he said the same thing in June and 2023, noting that normal procurement procedures would take another one or two months more to commence. The GMOA Media Committee Member said that his outfit had continually warmed that emergency purchasing only paved the way for low quality pharmaceuticals entering the country and wasting a large amount of public funds levied as taxes from citizens. In 2022 alone Rs 30 billion was spent on emergency purchasing by the Health Ministry he said.     "

Accordingly, they said that some farmers are in dire straits as they are unable to buy fertilisers for their fields and no action has been taken so far. They also said that some farmers’ crops were damaged due to the dry weather in the last Yala season (2022-2023) and about one hundred and twenty thousand acres of cultivated land (Paddy Field) in the Eastern Province were partially damaged due to rain, but, the farmers did not get any relief.    They further said that by failing to provide subsidy money and cultivation compensation provided by the government continuously, the farmers will stay away from cultivation. The Ministry of Agriculture has announced that due to the heavy rains of the past few days, about seven per cent of the paddy fields have been gone under water and that in the Badulla and Nuwara Eliya districts, paddy fields are being planted late in the Mas season and the financial allocations for those have not been paid yet. "

Similarly, God used Messengers/ Angels as a medium to announce the good news on the resurrection of Jesus and to continue with his service. God keeps on calling us also to do this service. All those who have received the invitation from God, have not obtained all that they have wanted and lived a luxurious life. Instead, they have got used to living their life with faith in God. The God’s experience that they have received has triggered them to live His Life. Also, it has triggered them to fulfil their responsibilities and duties more and more and with pure mind. Hence, they have become trustworthy to God. We have also been invited like Mother Mary and the Angels. How are we living our life? Are we also acting according to the words of God? Immaculate Mother Mary pray for the Sri Lankans and people all over the world.

The cost of living has reached sky high. Children are finding it difficult to continue their education. Child abuse is on the rise. Mothers and the housewives find it extremely difficult to run the family. The youngsters are postponing their marriages and the newly married couples are postponing having babies due to the economic crisis in the country. Women are sometimes ill-treated at home or the workplaces. Employees’ income is insufficient to meet make ends meet. Businessmen and all Professionals are finding it an arduous task to perform their duties due to economic crisis in the country. Farmers are finding it hard to have a bountiful harvest due to natural disasters and the economic crisis. Most of the farmers, businessmen, self-employed, professionals and employees are leading a debt-ridden life. Stress, Anxiety and depression are very common in adults and children. Most of the youth are unemployed and they have become a burden to society. People are inflicted with diseases of the mind and body. Patients find it difficult to buy their medicines as those medicines are very expensive and or out of stock. Patients who have to undergo surgery have to wait for a long time due to various strikes. Youths are addicted to alcohol, cigarette smoking and Narcotics. People have become greedy, jealous and selfish. People want to earn and progress by hook or crook. Crime rates are escalating in the country. Prisons are overcrowded. People have become solipsistic.  Please open the eyes of the people to the facts of ‘humanity and brotherhood’. Make them follow our Saviour’s footsteps and get closer to God. Let them love their neighbours. Make them calm and kind hearted. Make them have ‘implicit faith in God’. In our humble prayer we seek your countless blessings to resolve all the pressing problems outlined above.  Mother Mary, You are well known to perform miracles. Hence, we pray wholeheartedly for You to perform yet another miracle to safeguard your children from all problems and make them your ebullient devotees as in the past. In our humble opinion, ‘Children are the future of our Nation’, ‘Women are the eyes of our Nation’ and ‘Men are the gems of our Nation’. Dear Mother Mary, Protect them all.

Among some of those recommendations are: add a supra grade above the present Class 1 vis-à-vis the promotion of school principals, increasing a principal’s allowance from the current maximum of Rs 6,000 to Rs 15,000, several concessions for communication, travelling allowances, vehicles and houses, that are provided to public officers, to be made available to Government school principals as well and the provision of a special allowance for the principals serving in difficult areas.  The report further said that adding a supra grade, above the current top Class 1, is justifiable in terms of the large size of the ‘Sri Lanka Principals Service’ (SLPS) cadre, which stands as 16,512. The Sri Lanka Education Service (SLEAS), with a smaller cadre of 2,691 already has four classes including a comparable grade (supra grade) where the monthly salary is Rs 88,000 which could be increased to Rs 120,400, whereas the ‘equivalent’ to the school principal is currently ‘Grade 1’ with a salary of a mere Rs 58,345 which can go up to only Rs 97,945, the report said.  “A supra-grade is required to prepare officers of SLPS to undertake new and higher functional responsibilities that will be assigned to the new posts of head of divisional education boards to be created under the forthcoming education reforms, the Gunaapala Nanayakkara report further said. Among the other recommendations in the Gunapala Nanayakkara report were, a) Entertainment allowance: Allocate to schools an entertainment allowance to be used by the principals as follows: (i) schools over 1,500 students – Rs 3,000 per month, (ii) schools between 750 and 1,500 – Rs 2,500, and (iii) other schools – Rs 1,500 a month.  b) Travel: Reimburse principal’s official travel expenses (bus fare, three-wheeler) c) Communication allowance: Pay to principals, what is now paid to SLEAS. Adopt Public Finance Cir. 03/2014 (1) in this regard as approved by Cabinet on 31.08.2021, and recommendations of the Cabinet Sub-Committee. D) Vehicle Permit: Give back the eligibility for a vehicle permit to import a vehicle duty free, which was removed years ago.  e) Professional development: Reimburse the total fees of educational and training programmes considered in the scheme of promotion. f) Schooling of Children of Principals: Give priority to the children of principals in school admissions.  Housing: Assign school quarters to principals free in schools classified as difficult/very difficult. Improve the facilities of quarters, have a maintenance budget and provide a KKS (peon) for services in all schools and pay a housing rent for principals in schools without quarters for principals."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/06/record-high-taxes-utility-rates-sharply-down-mp/,"Record high taxes, utility rates sharply down MP",By Paneetha Ameresekere,0,2024-02-05T20:31:00+00:00,"Government of Sri Lanka’s (GoSL) face value money printing  (FVMP) debt decreased for the second consecutive market day to yesterday, this time by  1.04  per cent (Rs 30,949 million) to Rs 2,944,730.63 million (Rs 2.9447 trillion) over the previous market day Friday), sustainably aided by record high taxes and utility rates, thereby partially nullifying demand-pull inflationary pressure.  However, year-on-year (YoY) to yesterday, GoSL’s FVMP debt has fallen steeply, by at least Rs 2,929,476.94 million (Rs 2.9295 trillion/49.87 per cent) to Rs 2,944,730.63 million, aided by the above sky high taxes and utility rates, executed as per IMF diktats, thereby sharply reducing demand-pull inflationary pressure.  But in the obverse, high tax and utility bills, which aided in this massive reduction in MP, run the risk of destabilising the political and socioeconomic fabric of the country if unsupported by a rise in real incomes, employment and better employment opportunities. Meanwhile, led by the settlement of Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL’s) swaps with the GoSL, where the former swapped foreign exchange (FX) for rupees, liquidity during  yesterday’s trading fell by Rs 63,752 million (USD 203.49 million). Conversions are based on the value of the offer rate of the benchmark ‘spot’ as at Thursday (1) which was Rs 313.30 to the US dollar. Subsequently market’s net shortfall increased by 258.68 per cent (Rs 94,701 million) to Rs 131,310 million, yesterday over Friday.   In making the above swaps deducement, settlements of CBSL’s swaps with the market and/or CBSL’s sales of FX from the country’s foreign reserves to meet GoSL’s foreign debt servicing commitments to multilateral donors are discounted.  CBSL’s daily open market operations (OMO) from where these numbers are deduced, lack transparency. Swaps between GoSL and CBSL are foreign reserves neutral. A year ago GoSL’s FVMP debt was at least Rs 5.8742 trillion. GoSL’s FVMP debt in these instances is taken to be equivalent to the totality of the value of CBSL’s T-Bill and T-Bond holdings.  However, when there are sufficient revenues, CBSL/GoSL can retire maturing T-Bills and T-Bonds without having those to be reissued to CBSL (the creditor), as GoSL and its agents (Ceylon Electricity Board, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, National Water Supply & Drainage Board, etc.) are compensated for giving GoSL and its agents (debtor) credit previously, by being repaid their dues by the consumer and in turn to the CBSL, aided by high tax and utility bills,  thereby resulting in the retiring of such T-Bills and T-Bonds upon their maturities, leading to a reduction in such holdings by CBSL.  That consequently, leads to a reduction in circulated money or money printing due to such actions, with such money going back to CBSL’s godowns and being removed from circulation, thereby nullifying demand-pull inflationary pressure.  CBSL, at least historically, used to print rupees when GoSL and its agents do not have sufficient revenues/money to meet their commitments, or to buy the required FX from the country’s foreign reserves to meet foreign debt service commitments, in this instance to multilateral donor agencies. However, the danger in money printing (MP) is that if it enters the domestic market, it causes demand-pull inflationary pressure. Investing in T Bills and T-Bonds is generally considered as being riskless, because, in the event GoSL is unable to repay such debt, CBSL is normally mandated to print demand pull inflationary money and repay such creditors. CBSL has the sole right to print rupees.  Nonetheless, the new CBSL Act has controlled CBSL’s money printing activities to a great extent.   ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days of trading. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and of its foreign reserves, deals in ‘spot’.  GoSL’s foreign debt servicing commitments are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market to prevent depreciative pressure on the rupee. Yesterday’s, GoSL’s FVMP debt of at least Rs 2,944,730.63 million includes previous provisional advances to GoSL and T-Bill purchases from the primary market amounting to Rs 2,713,144,352,010 (Rs 2.7131 trillion/Rs 2,713,144.35 million) in full made by CBSL, which, as per IMF diktats, were converted to T-Bills and T-Bonds on 21 September 2023, with their maturity dates ranging from 9 February 2024 to 15 June 2038.  A year ago GoSL’s FVMP debt would have had been at least Rs 5,874,207.57 million (Rs 5.8742 trillion) on the basis that it’s presumed that provisional advances and primary market T-Bill purchases made by CBSL then too amounted to at least Rs 2,713,144.35 million/Rs 2,713,144,352,010/Rs 2.7131 trillion (though, in actual fact it would have had been much more!).  CBSL lacks transparency to make accurate deducements.  The above deducement of at least Rs 2,713,144.35 million is made on the grounds that previous provisional advances to GoSL and T-Bill purchases from the primary market amounting to that amount (Rs 2,713,144.35 million) made in full made by CBSL, which, as per IMF diktats, were converted to T-Bills and T-Bonds on 21 September 2023, with their maturity dates ranging from 9 February 2024 to 15 June 2038, also stood as at Friday 3 February 2023, though in fact it would have had been much more.   Meanwhile, World Bank (WB) in a report released on 20 November 2023 said that end-user electricity tariff revisions of August 2022 and February 2023 increased the fixed and variable electricity costs to the consumer by a cumulative average of 705 and 264 per cent, respectively. The WB in this regard hasn’t taken into account the 18 per cent electricity tariff hike effected by the GoSL a month before this publication was released, ie on 20 October 2023.

He added that he is not a henchman of Wickremesinghe, but he had always worked according to his conscience. He said that he opined earlier that President Wickremesinghe should be given another term, as the country had no other alternative, while refuting allegations that he was attempting to divide the SLPP and go against Rajapaksas while being a henchman of Wickremesinghe.  Addressing former local government representatives of Katana and Divulapitiya, Minister Ranathunga also demanded of them to propose the name of a politician, if there was any alternative to President Wickremesinghe.

I will ignore such people who try to advice me. I will not hesitate to take bold decisions to take disciplinary action against those who criticise the party,” Premadasa added. It is the duty of SJB members to safeguard the party and see that it emerges victorious at future elections. Those who cannot carry out that duty should get out, he added.  “Some people try to draw a similarity between my father and me. However, I only accept my father’s development model.

The Cardinal charged that as of now, the country has fallen not only economically, but also politically. “We ask the leaders, whose freedom are you celebrating? The freedom of the rulers? The freedom of the people? Is it ‘freedom’ to invite foreign diplomats and belittle those who are starving in front of the country’s elites?” Cardinal Ranjith questioned. He said the current leadership class should be removed from power. “Those who ruled our nation during the latter years have only thought of their future instead of the people’s wellbeing. Therefore, it is essential to remove this class of leaders and replace them with a new class of leaders,” he said. The Cardinal who compared the Singaporean leaders with their Sri Lankan counterparts said Sri Lankan leaders used certain sections of the population to capture power and safeguard power. “Singaporean leaders brought, Chinese, Indian origin and Malay people together,” he recalled."

The Supreme Court Bench comprising Justices P. Padman Surasena, Janak de Silva and Mahinda Samayawardhena set aside the judgment in the appeal filed by the appellant SriLankan Airlines Ltd. citing P. R. S. E. Corea as the respondent.  The appeal cited that whilst operating as the senior flight steward on a UL 505 CMB/LON flight, the Respondent was accused of sexually harassing the victim flight stewardess. Thus, he was found guilty on the charges at a disciplinary inquiry and his service was terminated thereafter.  The respondent filed an application at the Labour Tribunal on 28 November 2005 and in 2013, it held that the termination of services of the Respondent was not just and equitable. The SriLankan Airlines Ltd. (Appellant) appealed to the Provincial High Court of the Western Province in Negombo and it was dismissed on 19 October 2016. The Court observed that the Article 11(1) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which Sri Lanka has signed and ratified without any reservation, requires States Parties to take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of employment. The Court taking the CEDAW General Recommendation No. 19 and the Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution and several other cases set aside both the judgment of the High Court of Negombo and order of the Tribunal.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/05/keheliya-remanded-as-suspect-under-public-property-act/,Keheliya remanded as suspect under Public Property Act,Author not found,0,2024-02-04T20:33:00+00:00,"Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella was remanded, until 15 February, by Maligakanda Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrama, after being listed as the eighth suspect in the ongoing case in connection with the procurement of substandard human immunoglobulin. This follows, Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, appearing for the prosecution, accusing the former Health Minister of amending the procurement process that governs the import of medicine, and urging Court to reject bail by naming him a suspect under the Public Property Act. Rambukwella, who is the environment minister, was produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate on Saturday. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested him on Friday (2) in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He was grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested. The arrest came in the midst of strong calls by civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate arrest of the lawmaker. Prior to the arrest of Rambukwella, seven others had been arrested in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in remand custody. Deputy Solicitor General Girihagama, alleged that Rambukwella had removed the suppliers registered with the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and enabled unregistered suppliers to enter the procurement process. Submitting a Cabinet paper, previously tabled by Rambukwella, to the Magistrate, the Deputy Solicitor General pointed out that there was no shortage of human immunoglobulin vaccine at the time when the former health minister sought Cabinet approval to make emergency purchases of a list of certain medicinal drugs. She also emphasised that no document was uncovered during the investigations to corroborate the need to prepare the Cabinet paper in question. The lack of such corroborating evidence reportedly prompted concerns within the Courthouse. Responding to a query put by the Magistrate, the Deputy Solicitor General mentioned that while recording a statement with the CID yesterday Rambukwella had revealed that the list of medicines was given to him by the Medical Supplies Division (MSD). He had further claimed that the Cabinet memorandum was not prepared by him. It was further revealed that a staggering sum. to the tune of over Rs 144 million, had been paid for the procurement and that the money credited to the account of the first suspect had been withdrawn within just three days. As such, the prosecution argued that Rambukwella’s bail application should be rejected since he has been charged under the Public Property Act. President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratna, representing the accused, said all Cabinet ministers should thus be brought forward for questioning. He also cast doubts as to how the entire Cabinet of Ministers were misled by a single document. Commenting on the lost document, the defence counsel, noting that the authorities should ‘go after’ the person who lost the documents without making allegations against the minister, urged the Magistrate to grant bail to Rambukwella, while highlighting his client’s medical conditions. After taking into account all the submissions, the Maligakanda Magistrate said Rambukwella, as the then-health minister, must be responsible for all actions conducted by the ministry beyond just signing a document. In October 2023, the NMRA revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of 22,500 vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. The product was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India and imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party."

The court ruled that Khan’s 2018 marriage with Bushra Bibi, a faith healer, was un-Islamic and illegal. He is already in jail for corruption. Last Wednesday, a week before a general election, the pair were convicted of profiting from state gifts. Khan, 71, has said the numerous cases against him are politically motivated. Pakistan’s former cricket captain-turned-politician was ousted as prime minister in 2022. A court was set up inside the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan is serving his previous sentences, for the latest case. The complaint was filed by Bibi’s ex-husband, who said her marriage with Khan had been fraudulent. Under Muslim family law, women are prohibited from remarrying for a few months after their husband dies or they are divorced. The court found that Bibi had remarried before the completion of the stipulated time following her divorce. As well as the seven-year jail sentence, the court imposed a fine of 500,000 rupees ($1,800; £1,420) on Khan and Bibi. The couple married in 2018, months before Khan was elected prime minister. Bibi, a spiritual healer believed to be in her 40s and always wears a veil in public, is Khan’s third wife. Khan had a playboy reputation in his cricketing years before he settled down to a society marriage with Jemima Goldsmith in 1995. The marriage lasted nine years and produced two sons. A second marriage in 2015, to journalist and former BBC weather presenter Reham Khan, lasted less than a year. The former PM has been detained since his arrest last August. Saturday’s prison sentence is Khan’s third in less than a week. On Tuesday, he was jailed for 10 years for leaking classified documents. Wednesday’s court case centred on accusations that he and his wife had sold or kept state gifts received in office, including jewellery from the Saudi Crown Prince. Both were given 14-year sentences in that case. The court ruled that Bushra Bibi was allowed to serve hers under house arrest. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has said he was tried by “kangaroo courts”. Even before the latest sentences were handed down, many were questioning the credibility of next week’s election as Khan and his party have been sidelined. The authorities deny carrying out a crackdown, but many of PTI leaders are behind bars or have defected. Thousands of the party’s supporters were rounded up after protests – at times violent – when Khan was taken into custody last year. The man tipped to win is three-time former PM Nawaz Sharif. He was jailed for corruption ahead of the 2018 election that Imran Khan won. Many analysts say he is now favoured by Pakistan’s powerful military establishment. (BBC)"

The arrests came after a joint raid by police and officials from Turkey’s MIT intelligence agency in Istanbul and the western city of Izmir. A month ago, 34 people with suspected Mossad links were charged with spying. Turkey’s president has warned Israel of “serious consequences” if it targets Hamas members on Turkish soil. Turkey – unlike most Western countries and some Arab states – does not classify Hamas as a terrorist organisation. There is strong support for the Palestinians in Turkey, with tens of thousands regularly attending rallies in Istanbul and other cities. Ankara has as not yet made a formal statement about Friday’s arrests. But media reports via unnamed officials say MIT discovered that Mossad was using private detectives to monitor, photograph and track suspected Hamas members. In January Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said the 34 detainees were charged with “political or military espionage” on behalf of Israeli intelligence. Mossad is believed to have recruited Palestinians and Syrian nationals living in Turkey as part of its operations. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been involved in an increasingly bitter war of words with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since Israel’s war with Hamas began. He has described Netanyahu’s actions in Gaza as “genocide” and last month compared him to Hitler. Israeli intelligence officials have vowed to target Hamas outside the Palestinian territories, including in Lebanon, Qatar and Turkey. Israel launched its war against the Islamist group after its fighters crossed into Israel on 7 October and carried out a series of deadly attacks which led to the deaths of about 1,300 people. Some 250 people were taken back to Gaza as hostages – with 105 subsequently released during a truce in November. (BBC)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

The project is jointly implemented by UNDP, Ministry of Irrigation, Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Ministry of Environment.

The project, as outlined on the website, aims to collaborate with various sectors such as agriculture, plantations, irrigation, power, and tourism. Its goals include enhancing ecosystem services, reducing land degradation, stream bank erosion, restoring forests, and establishing wildlife corridors. Moreover, the project will leverage area-based natural, cultural, and heritage resources to enhance tourism potential, promote precision farming, and provide value-added market access to products and services from the area.

Routine surgeries were postponed while patients were given alternate dates.  Some of the patients inconvenienced were those who had reached hospitals around 6 a.m. having left home early in order to get to the hospital as early as possible. The strike was implemented in countrywide hospitals including Teaching Hospitals Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala and Ragama, Base Hospitals Badulla and District General Hospital Vavuniya. Several services provided by hospitals, including those duties carried out by health assistants, telephone operators and ambulance drivers, cooks were halted or carried out by the Sri Lanka Armed Forces. Several Medical Offices of Health (MoH),   prevention and control work and, maternal and child care services were affected by the strike as family health officers (FHO) and Public Health Inspectors and even a section of the nursing officers were engaged in the strike.  In response to the island-wide strike by State health sector trade unions, the Sri Lanka Army deployed its troops to government hospitals across the country. Troops stepped in at the request of the Ministry of Defence under the guidance of the Commander of the Army, who aims to ensure the uninterrupted provision of essential medical services to the public. Troops were deployed at the National Hospital Colombo, National Eye Hospital, Dental Hospital Colombo,  Teaching Hospitals Kalubowila, Kurunegala,  Kegalle, Matara and  Karapitiya, Base Hospitals  Homagama,  Mirigama, and Dehiaththakandiya, Maravila, Udugama, Dankotuwa, Athurugiriya, Nawagamuwa, Bandaragama, , Balangoda, Debarawewa and Ehaliyagoda,  District General Hospital Avissawella, Institute of Infectious Diseases, Angoda , Colombo East Base Hospital, and Nevil Fernando Hospital, General Hospital Moneragala, Hambantota Hospital, in collaboration with respective hospital authorities. Meanwhile the Health Trade Union Alliance (HTUA) said, it had extended its strike for economic justice to continue throughout today (2), as well while it would take a further action following a decision taken later in the day.  HTUA Convenor Chanaka Dharmawickrema said, the striking unions has suspended their strike  earlier as the Health and Financial Ministries had pledged a discussion with the promise of obtaining a date for discussion with the President once he returned to the country.  However, he has already returned while there is no sign of them arranging a discussion.  Director General of Trade Unions (DGTUs), who was also the Chairman of the Government Nursing Officers’ Association (GNOA) Saman Ratnapriya said, the government understood that there was an issue, however, when the country is going through such an economic crisis the government could not provide immediate solutions to their demand.  Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said, a few trade union leaders in the State Health Service had merely dragged their trade union members on to the road. It is not realistic or legal for non-medical trade unions to ask for the same disturbance, availability and transport (DAT) allowance increase of Rs 35,000.    Pic by Sarath Kumara"

The Bill is now in effect as the Online Safety Act No. 9 of 2024 and came into effect yesterday (1).  The legislation was passed through the House without a formal vote after a two-day debate, during which the Opposition strongly criticised it, contending that it could encroach upon the freedom of expression. In the voting during the Second Reading, the Bill garnered 108 in favour and 62 against. The Online Safety Act not only attracted the scrutiny of local activists and organisations but, also drew the attention of diplomats and major international entities, asserting that the legislation exhibited various problematic elements. According to the government, the Online Safety Act, published in the Government Gazette on 18 September 2023 and presented to Parliament by Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles, intends to prohibit the online dissemination of specific statements within the country.  It further seeks to curb the utilisation of online accounts, whether authentic or unauthentic, for prohibited purposes and to suppress the financing and other forms of support for the communication of false statements and related matters. The proposed Online Safety Bill suggests imprisonment for content deemed illegal by a five-member commission. Additionally, it holds social media platforms like Google, Facebook, and X (previously known as Twitter) responsible for the content posted on their platforms. The government asserts that the primary objective of the Bill is to combat cybercrimes, encompassing issues such as child abuse, data theft and online fraud."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He alleged that influential sections within the current regime are actively working to destroy the Wedithalathivu Nature Reserve and the Adam’s Bridge Marine National Park.  According to Dr. Gunawardana, these individuals aim to acquire the wetlands for commercial and development purposes. Dr. Gunawardana claimed that there are plans to release the Wedithalathivu Nature Reserve for the cultivation of aquatic plants, a scheme that faced opposition from environmentalists over the past seven years. Furthermore, he asserted that he has reliable information confirming that certain individuals with vested interests in the present government intend to utilise the Adam’s Bridge Marine National Park for trade and development activities. Dr. Gunawardana highlighted the significance of the park, stating that, according to a survey conducted by the Lanka Ornithology Society 12 years ago, it is home to the second-largest congregation of migratory birds in the world. Emphasising the need for concrete action over mere statements, Dr. Gunawardana stressed the importance of taking decisive steps to preserve the country’s wetlands. Meanwhile, Minister of Wildlife Pavithra Wanniarachchi announced that, to mark World Wetlands Day, three new wetlands would be declared under the Ramsar Convention on this day (2). The Wildlife Conservation Department plans to designate Wedithalathivu Nature Reserve, Adam’s Bridge Marine National Park and Chundikulam National Park in the Jaffna District as new wetlands in 2024. The minister mentioned that efforts have been made to expand the Vankalai Sanctuary to include the Wedithalativu Nature Reserve. In addition, Vanniarachchi said,  necessary activities are in progress to declare the Mirissa Marine Sanctuary within this year. As of now, Sri Lanka has declared six wetlands under the Ramsar Convention, including Bundala National Park, Madu Ganga Sanctuary, Anawilundawa Sanctuary, Vankalai Sanctuary, Kudumbigala Wetland Cluster and Wilpattu Sanctuary. The national event to mark the World Wetlands Day will be held today (2) in Diyasaru Park in Thalawatugoda. The event is jointly organised by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) and the Department of Wildlife Conservation. "

Earlier yesterday (1) private bus owners’ associations urged for immediate action to raise bus fares in response to the continuous increase in fuel prices. Anjana Priyanjith, chief secretary of the All-Ceylon Private Bus Owners’ Association, emphasised the need for fare adjustments following recent diesel price hikes, stating, “Earlier, the price of diesel was raised by Rs 29 per litre, and then the relevant prices were increased again by Rs 5 yesterday. Therefore, the bus fares must be increased.” President of the Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association (LPBOA), Gemunu Wijeratne, announced plans to raise bus fares within the next two weeks, with the minimum fare expected to reach at least Rs 35. Wijeratne added that fare adjustments would be made even forcefully if necessary. However, the secretary of the All-Ceylon School Children Transport Association, Lalith Chandrasiri, mentioned that a decision on fare increases has not been reached. The All Ceylon Inter-Provincial School Children Transport Services Association indicated that fare hikes are inevitable due to rising fuel prices and the impact of increased Value Added Tax (VAT). Contrastingly, the All Island Three-Wheeler Drivers’ Association stated that despite fuel price increases, three-wheeler fares will remain unchanged."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/02/govt-should-clearly-explain-reforms-to-the-people-us-envoy/,Govt should clearly explain reforms to the people – US Envoy,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-01T20:33:00+00:00,"US Ambassador Julie J Chung stressed the importance of the Sri Lankan Government implementing reforms and concurrently ensuring clear communication to the public about it.  Addressing the Amcham CXO Forum ‘75 years and Beyond: US-Sri Lankan Business Relations in 2024’, held on 31  January, the US Ambassador said, the recently introduced elevated VAT rates have had a notable impact on the average Sri Lankan citizens and businesses. While acknowledging the short-term challenges, she emphasised the public’s right to be informed that these measures are part of a holistic approach to address underlying problems and endemic issues. “We understand that while there may be short term necessary pains, the public deserves to know that such measures are being taken looking at the wholeness of the problem and endemic issues that must be addressed in a structural, sustainable way, fair and transparent to all,” she said. She said, instead, the focus should include eliminating tax loopholes and tackling government inefficiencies, particularly within State-owned enterprises. “It’s important that the Government of Sri Lanka carry out reforms. But, it’s also important to explain those reforms to the people in a clear manner. It makes for slower, but better legislation and reforms,” said the US Envoy.  She acknowledged that these are challenging steps, often met with public resistance. Sri Lanka, in its pursuit of long-term sustainability and adherence to IMF commitments, has already implemented difficult measures. However, Chung emphasised that the people of Sri Lanka rightfully demand openness, transparency, and accountability from their leaders as the reform process advances. Chung stressed the significant USD 553 million investment by the US’ International Development Finance Corporation in the Western Container Terminal at the Port of Colombo. Despite being the DFC’s second-largest exposure in the entire Indo-Pacific region, she underscored that this substantial investment alone is insufficient. Meeting the commitments outlined in the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility programme necessitates comprehensive government reform, focusing on tax compliance and the fight against corruption. She proposed digitalising Customs processes to enhance revenue and reduce corruption. Establishing predictable Customs duties and streamlined procedures would provide importers with confidence, encouraging increased imports to Sri Lanka. The Ambassador noted that unpredictable Customs fees deter importers, limiting the government’s Customs revenue collection and ultimately placing a heavier tax burden on the people, who are already strained. Citing that on her visit to the National Chamber of Exporters, she was informed about the challenges faced by exporters, including red tape, regulatory obstacles, and business uncertainties. Stressing the pivotal role of exports and private sector growth as the driving force for economic recovery, she emphasised the necessity of providing the necessary space and support for these sectors to flourish. The United States, being the largest export market for Sri Lanka, is poised to contribute significantly to the solution and support the country’s economic advancement. Regarding the Online Safety Bill, the Envoy highlighted a recent report from the Centre for Policy Alternatives, revealing that over 70 per cent of Sri Lankans were unaware of the Bill prior to its passage. Expressing concern, she noted that when major global tech companies label the Bill as ‘unworkable’ and detrimental to innovation and democracy, without effectively addressing online crimes, it sends a negative signal for Sri Lanka’s reform and recovery efforts. Chung pointed out that previous Bills, such as the Personal Data Protection Act, took more time to craft but, were better at incorporating stakeholder feedback. To develop legislation and reforms that are durable, enforceable, and prudent, she emphasised the need for the Sri Lankan Government to improve its approach in the future. This improvement is crucial for enhancing the overall business climate."

Zuckerberg – who runs Instagram and Facebook – turned to them and said “no-one should go through” what they had. He and the bosses of TikTok, Snap, X and Discord were questioned for almost four hours by senators from both parties. Lawmakers wanted to know what they are doing to protect children online. Legislation is currently going through Congress which aims to hold social media companies to account for material posted on their platforms. Wednesday’s hearing was a rare opportunity for the US senators to question tech bosses. Zuckerberg and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew voluntarily agreed to testify – but the heads of Snap, X (formerly Twitter) and messaging platform Discord initially refused and were sent government-issued subpoenas. Behind the five tech bosses sat families who said their children had self-harmed or killed themselves as a result of social media content. They made their feelings known throughout, hissing when the CEOs entered and applauding when lawmakers asked tough questions. While the hearing mostly focused on the protection of children from online sexual exploitation, the questions varied widely as the senators took advantage of having five powerful executives there under oath. But it was Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta, who came under the most scrutiny, as he testified before Congress for an eighth time. At one-point, Republican Senator Ted Cruz asked, “Zuckerberg, what the hell were you thinking?” when he showed the tech boss an Instagram prompt that warns users they may be about to see child sexual abuse material, but asks if they would like to “see the results anyway”. Zuckerberg said the “basic science behind that” is “it’s often helpful to, rather than just blocking it, to help direct them towards something that could be helpful”. He also promised to “personally look into it”. During another exchange with Republican Senator Josh Hawley, Zuckerberg was invited to apologise to the families sitting behind him. He stood up, turned to the audience and said: “I’m sorry for everything you’ve all gone through, it’s terrible. “No-one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.” (BBC)"

After the launch, Prime Minister said, that Sri Lanka’s vision for new Sri Lanka cannot be achieved without developing and promoting sustainable businesses. “Businesses today hold immense power not just as engines of economic growth, but also as agents of positive change,” he said.  Pointing out that the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals or the SDGs rightly recognised this need by placing businesses at the heart of the global development agenda, he said that Sri Lanka is acutely aware of this potential; hence, engaging and empowering the private sector and harmonising the private and public sector businesses is considered to be crucial in our ambitious journey towards rebuilding a stronger country. United Nations Under Secretary General Armida Alisjahbana, thanking the Prime Minister for stressing the importance of the business sector to achieve SDGs, said, the UN and ESCAP would continuously support Sri Lanka’s efforts towards SDGs. Ministers Dr. Ramesh Pathirana and Mahinda Amaraweera, the diplomatic community, Secretaries and senior officials were present. Following is the full text of the speech of the Prime Minister:  As I stand before you today, we find ourselves at a pivotal moment in Sri Lanka’s journey towards a brighter and more sustainable future.  We all know that the world is grappling with unprecedented challenges – climate change, economic turbulence, and social inequities to name a few. Yet, within these anxieties, lies an immense opportunity to not just recover, but to reimagine and rebuild a Sri Lanka that will not only be prosperous but, also more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient. We have inherited the imperative of sustainability of nature from the ancient Buddhist value system. When Arhath Mahinda, who was sent by Emperor Ashoka to introduce Buddhism to Sri Lanka, he told king Devanampiyatissa “king you are not a ruler of this land, flying birds, moving reptiles, as well as other animals and human beings under your custody, you are not a ruler but, you are the guardian of the land.”  This doctrine stressed that man is part of the nature and significant the human beings as well as the other creatures.  Based on that heritage, our vision for this new Sri Lanka cannot be achieved without developing and promoting sustainable businesses. Businesses today hold immense power not just as engines of economic growth, but also as agents of positive change.  The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals or the SDGs rightly recognised this, placing businesses at the heart of the global development agenda. In Sri Lanka, we are acutely aware of this potential; hence, engaging and empowering the private sector and harmonising the private and public sector businesses is considered to be crucial in our ambitious journey towards rebuilding a stronger country. Recent developments in Sri Lanka, from the devastating Easter attacks of 2019 to the ongoing economic crisis partly induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, have underscored the urgent need for a new economic paradigm.  As constantly emphasised by President, the role of private sector-led, competitive growth integrated within regional and global markets is deemed a crucial element of this new paradigm. This is where the Inclusive and Sustainable Business Strategy comes in.  This robust strategy, born from a collaborative, cross-sectoral effort, presents a roadmap for businesses to not only thrive financially but, also contribute meaningfully to our social and environmental well-being. The core of this strategy hinges on two key pillars, namely, inclusivity and sustainability. Inclusivity demands that nobody is left behind in our march towards progress. Every entrepreneur, every farmer, every small business owner must have the opportunity to prosper and contribute.  This means dismantling barriers to entry, fostering financial inclusion, and ensuring fair and equitable access to resources.  Sustainability, on the other hand, goes beyond mere environmental protection, encompassing resource efficiency, responsible social practices, high ethical standards, and good governance.  Our businesses must operate with long-term vision, minimising their environmental footprint, maximising their overall positive impact, and leaving a legacy of shared prosperity for future generations. This doesn’t stop there. Much like enterprises and entrepreneurs, their customers as well as the community should also benefit from Inclusive and Sustainable Businesses.  Therefore, this strategy is not merely a document; it is a call to action, and a pledge to uphold sustainability and inclusivity as a nation. We invite all stakeholders – businesses, government agencies, civil society organisations, and academia to embrace this shared vision and collaborate in its implementation. I urge business leaders to seize this opportunity. Integrate sustainability and inclusivity into your core values; embrace innovative solutions and responsible practices. I am aware that many of you have already embarked on a journey towards achieving sustainability in your operations, and I urge you to double down on your efforts in this worthy cause. To the government agencies, my message is that we need supportive policies that incentivise sustainable and inclusive business practices, eliminate bureaucratic hurdles, and foster a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem. It is your responsibility to make it happen. I request civil society organisations to continue playing a critical role in awareness creation, advocacy, and community engagement, because you must be the bridge between businesses and communities, ensuring that sustainability benefits everyone. To the academia, my kind request is to share your knowledge and expertise, which are invaluable in developing practical solutions and guiding businesses on their sustainability journey. Industry-Academia collaborations will be key to fostering innovation for sustainability. Sri Lanka’s story will not be written by governments or corporations alone. It will be written by the collective actions of each individual, each organisation – business or otherwise, and every single one of us.  Let us join hands, leverage our strengths, and build a Sri Lanka where prosperity and sustainability walk hand-in-hand. With commitment, collaboration, and unwavering action, I firmly believe that we can transform this blueprint into a vibrant reality. The time for talk is over; the time for action is now. Let me extend my heartfelt gratitude to all who made the Inclusive and Sustainable Business strategy a reality. From the tireless efforts of the Sustainable Development Council and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific to the invaluable insights of diverse stakeholders across multiple sectors and agencies, your collaboration and dedication have paved the way for a greener, more equitable Sri Lanka. Thank you for being the architects of this transformative journey. Let us embark on this journey together, towards a greener, fairer, and more inclusive Sri Lanka for all."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

She also requested Opposition Leader Premadasa, who she claims to be raising an unnecessary furore about a tear gas attack, to reflect on the Opposition Leader’s father, the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa’s path and then accuse or point the finger at the current President. She also claimed that Premadasa’s father was the pioneer of State terrorism and that everyone else experienced how he upheld democracy during 1988/89. She stressed that rallying people in the city of Colombo to gain the authority of the State improperly could cause serious economic damage to the country, and the arrival of tourists to this country would be hampered. The State Minister also said the hospitalisation of MP Mujibur Rahuman due to breathing difficulties following the tear gas attack was a cause for laughter and accused the Opposition Leader and MP Rahuman of being relentless in their need to take away her MP position."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/01/restraining-the-appointment-of-igp-violates-the-constitution-pmd/,Restraining the appointment of IGP violates the constitution – PMD,Author not found,0,2024-01-31T20:36:00+00:00,"In what appears to be a stern warning not to curtail his Executive Powers, the President yesterday (31) insisted any restraint placed on him in executing his constitutional duty would be deemed as a violation of the Constitution.  This was mentioned in an official statement issued by the President’s Media Division (PMD) last evening.  The statement, however, has made it apparent that the President was irked by the continuous ‘hindrances’ posed by the Constitutional Council in appointing key State officials including the Inspector General of Police (IGP).  The PMD statement said the President expects to raise these concerns with Parliament soon.  “The President of the Republic of Sri Lanka, as per Article 4(b) of the Constitution, is responsible for exercising the Executive power of the People, including State defence.  As the head of the Executive, the President has the constitutional obligation to make specific appointments to high offices, such as the IGP, following the procedure outlined by the Constitution. This is in line with the President’s duty to exercise powers related to State defence.  Therefore, the President must fulfil his constitutional duties without any hindrance or interference. Article 41C of the Constitution dictates that the appointment of the IGP occurs after the President recommends a suitable candidate to the Constitutional Council, with the CC’s subsequent approval,” the statement said.  Any obstruction imposed on the President in the execution of his constitutional duty would be a violation of the Constitution. In case the President exercises his powers in violation of the Constitution, the Constitution itself provides remedies. The Constitutional Council, chaired by the Speaker of Parliament and established under the Constitution, is empowered to assist the President in certain decisions and is a part of the Executive. The Constitutional Council is obligated to carry out its functions according to the Constitution. Restraining the CC from performing its functions related to the appointment of the IGP under Article 41C of the Constitution would be a breach of the Constitution, the PMD’s statement added.  “Also, if the Constitutional Council misuses the power conferred upon it in violation of the Constitution, remedies are available within the Constitution itself. The Speaker, as the head of Parliament, holds the responsibility under Article 4C of the Constitution, where Parliament exercises the judicial power of the people through Courts. Parliament is thus accountable solely to the people,” the statement highlighted.  This is not the first time the President made what appears to be ‘warnings’ and criticisms against the conduct of the Constitutional Council. In November last year, the President announced that a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) would be established to investigate the delays caused by the CC in approving appointments to key positions in Sri Lanka. The President made this declaration following a vigorous Parliamentary discussion addressing the prolonged approval process by the Constitutional Council for high-ranking positions in the country. He emphasised that these delays have led to the absence of crucial roles, such as the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and judges, resulting in the compromised functioning of both the Police and Judiciary."

This team will assist voters in need of sign language to cast their votes. Ratnayake emphasised the need to prepare polling centres in the country to better accommodate people with disabilities.  The Election Commission aims to bring about changes in the electoral process and has formulated a strategic plan for this purpose. Recognising the practical challenges faced by the disabled community during elections, Ratnayake highlighted the issuance of identity cards for the disabled as one solution to address this issue. He acknowledged the lack of a proper data system regarding disabled individuals in the country, which has become a significant problem. The Election Commission aims to address these deficiencies while filling the electoral rolls for the year 2023. Ratnayake clarified that the programme faced various obstacles during implementation, with some claiming that government funds were being utilised. He clarified that no government funds were involved, and the programme was being implemented through the People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) organisation. Ratnayake was speaking at an event held in Kurunegala on 30 January, where identity cards were distributed to people with disabilities in the Kurunegala District."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/01/42-bottom-trawlers-seized-from-t-nadu-poachers-dfar/,42 bottom trawlers seized from T. Nadu poachers – DFAR,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-01-31T20:33:00+00:00,"Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR) officials said they have seized 42 bottom trawlers from poachers hailing from Tamil Nadu in 2022.  Following the auctioning of approximately 150 bottom trawlers and engine boats in 2022, the DFAR official said the confiscated trawlers rightfully belong to Sri Lanka. A spokesperson from the DFAR’s Investigation and Training Division highlighted yesterday (31) that upon confiscation, the fishing trawlers become the property of the Sri Lankan Government. The official noted that numerous dilapidated trawlers have been auctioned off, stressing that not only is poaching in Sri Lankan waters illegal but the use of bottom trawlers itself is also prohibited. “It’s crucial to understand that both poaching in Sri Lankan waters and employing bottom trawlers are violations of the law,” added the official. Once the fishermen’s arrest is legally initiated, the fishing trawlers are seized and subjected to confiscation through the Magistrate Court, firmly becoming the property of Sri Lanka, the investigator from DFAR said. Several of these vessels face the wrath of typhoons and rough weather while in custody at Navy bases islandwide. Unfortunately, some have succumbed to these conditions, sinking or being dismantled and subsequently auctioned for scrap materials. The official further revealed that, through appeals to the Magistrate, some individuals have successfully retrieved their fishing trawlers. However, any trawlers that remain in Sri Lanka after the stipulated Court-issued time period automatically fall under the ownership of Sri Lanka. The official pointed out that the Tamil Nadu Government has no authority to request the return of these confiscated assets. President of the National Tamil People’s Front (NTPF), A. Kamalanathan, addressed the issue in a letter to Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi, specifically regarding fishing trawlers and other assets confiscated in Sri Lanka due to poaching.   Citing the situation of the fishing boats belonging to Indian fishermen being confiscated by the Sri Lankan Government, the NTPF has urged India to take back those fishing trawlers.  “As you are aware, there have been repeated incidents involving several Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu crossing into Sri Lankan territorial waters for poaching who have been arrested and detained in Sri Lanka,” Kamalanathan said. The depletion of fish stocks within India’s waters has impacted fishermen from India, leaving them with no other alternative but to venture into Sri Lankan territorial waters, claimed Kamalanathan. He added that it had impacted the livelihoods of the Sri Lankan Tamil fishing community of the North and East.   The fishing boats belonging to Indian fishermen from the State of Tamil Nadu that have been confiscated left in a terrible condition. The boats are not secure and there have been incidents of theft of the boat parts which the law enforcement authorities in Sri Lanka have failed to address, he alleged. This has had an adverse impact on the livelihoods of the Tamil Nadu fishermen, with the boats not being returned to them as well.  The NTPF said the Tamil Nadu Government should engage in a constructive dialogue with the Sri Lankan Government to come to a meaningful and amicable settlement that will put an end to the fishing community’s plight from both sides and urged them to find a permanent solution. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has voiced profound concern over the “troubling pattern” of Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu being arrested. He urged the Central Government to re-establish a collaborative working group and underscored the urgent necessity for diplomatic initiatives to address the ongoing situation. In a letter addressed to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Chief Minister Stalin highlighted the recent arrest of six fishermen from Ramanathapuram District, along with two fishing boats, by the Sri Lanka Navy on 22 January. The fishermen were charged with allegedly trespassing into Sri Lankan waters and taken to the Kranji Navy camp. The fishermen’s dispute has been a long-standing problem that remains unaddressed, with no resolution in sight, despite continuous grievances from fishermen in the North and East of Sri Lanka."

The activists stressed they would not leave the site which they named ‘Keheliya Go Gama’ until the former Health Minister was arrested.  Although Rambukwella was scheduled to appear before the CID yesterday (31 January), he could not attend due to a prior commitment at the Colombo High Court for another case.  Consequently, the Minister had requested another date from the CID. Concurrently, Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Health, Dr. Saman Ratnayake, was summoned before the CID to provide a statement. He was subsequently arrested and produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate. A tense situation erupted near the CID premises when the activists refused to leave the Satyagraha site. Later, five of them were arrested by the Colombo Fort Police.  It was reported that Rambukwella would appear before the CID yesterday (31 January) night. However, he did not appear by 8:00 p.m."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/01/jacqueline-knowingly-used-conmans-proceeds/,Jacqueline knowingly used conman’s proceeds,Author not found,0,2024-01-31T20:33:00+00:00,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has told the Delhi High Court that Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez, accused in INR 2 billion money laundering case, was knowingly involved in the possession and use of proceeds of crime of alleged conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar, news agency PTI reported. The probe agency alleged that evidence showed that the actor “had been enjoying, using and was in possession of the proceeds of crime” of Sukesh Chandrasekhar. This contention by the ED was made in an affidavit filed in response to Jacqueline Fernandez’s plea that sought the cancellation of an FIR lodged against her in the money laundering case. The matter was listed before Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri and Jacqueline Fernandez’s counsel sought time to file a reply in response to the ED’s contention. The matter will be next heard by the High Court on 15 April. In its reply, the ED claimed that Jacqueline Fernandez “held back the truth till date” regarding the financial transactions with Sukesh Chandrasekhar and concealed facts until confronted with evidence, PTI reported. “She continues to hold back the truth even till date. It is also a fact that Fernandez wiped out the entire data from her mobile phone after the arrest of Sukesh Chandrasekhar, thereby tampering with the evidence. She also asked her colleagues to destroy the evidence. Evidence proves beyond doubt that she had been enjoying, using and is in possession of the proceeds of crime,” the probe agency said. “Thus, it is proved that Fernandez was knowingly involved in the possession and use of proceeds of crime of accused Chandrasekhar,” it claimed. The actor, the ED alleged, attempted to cover up her conduct by stating she was a victim of Sukesh Chandrasekhar, but was not able to furnish any substantial evidence to establish her claim. Jacqueline Fernandez was aware of the conman’s criminal intentions but still, she continued to receive, enjoy and possess proceeds of crime for herself and her family members, the ED said. It further claimed that the actor did not initially admit to receiving huge amounts of money and valuable gifts for her family by Sukesh Chandrasekhar. The agency stated that these luxury gifts were proceeds of crime being generated out of criminal activity. According to the ED, Jacqueline Fernandez was “well aware” about Sukesh Chandrasekhar’s criminal antecedents and continued to have a relationship with him despite the fact that Leena Maria Paul was the conman’s wife. Despite being aware of the conman’s marital status, she continued to receive financial benefits from him, which amounted to proceeds of crime, the probe agency said. In her plea filed through her counsel, Jacqueline Fernandez said, “At the outset, it is submitted that evidence filed by the ED would prove that the petitioner (Fernandez) is an innocent victim of Chandrasekhar’s maliciously targeted attack.” “There is absolutely no indication that she had any involvement whatsoever in aiding him to launder his purportedly ill-gotten wealth. Hence, she cannot be prosecuted for the offences under Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,” it said. It said the prosecution complaint filed against her confirmed that nowhere it has been alleged that she had knowledge about the nefarious activities of Chandrasekhar in extorting money from complainant Aditi Singh, PTI reported. “The entire complaint is silent about even a remote allegation of knowledge as attributed to the petitioner. It is impossible to suggest that the petitioner knowingly engaged in any of the activities that is today punished by Section 3 of the PMLA,” the plea added. The actor alleged that the ED acted in a partisan manner while arraigning her as an accused in the money laundering case. “The ED has given a clean chit to Nora Fatehi (another Bollywood actor) despite it being an admitted fact on record that her family member received a BMW car from Sukesh Chandrasekhar on her instructions. It is of importance to note that the fact of Nora Fatehi receiving gifts from Sukesh Chandrasekhar has been presented to ED under the head ‘dissipation of proceeds of crime’,” her plea said. Jacqueline Fernandez has appeared before the ED for questioning in the money laundering investigation against Sukesh Chandrasekhar and others. An FIR was registered by the Delhi Police against Sukesh Chandrasekhar for allegedly duping the spouses of former promoters of Ranbaxy — Shivinder Singh and Malvinder Singh — of INR 2 billion. The conman and his wife were arrested by the Delhi Police, along with others, and the ED registered a money laundering case against them. The Delhi Police had alleged that Sukesh Chandrasekhar and his wife used hawala routes and created shell companies to park the money earned as proceeds of crime. (PTI)"

This team will assist voters in need of sign language to cast their votes. Ratnayake emphasised the need to prepare polling centres in the country to better accommodate people with disabilities.  The Election Commission aims to bring about changes in the electoral process and has formulated a strategic plan for this purpose. Recognising the practical challenges faced by the disabled community during elections, Ratnayake highlighted the issuance of identity cards for the disabled as one solution to address this issue. He acknowledged the lack of a proper data system regarding disabled individuals in the country, which has become a significant problem. The Election Commission aims to address these deficiencies while filling the electoral rolls for the year 2023. Ratnayake clarified that the programme faced various obstacles during implementation, with some claiming that government funds were being utilised. He clarified that no government funds were involved, and the programme was being implemented through the People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) organisation. Ratnayake was speaking at an event held in Kurunegala on 30 January, where identity cards were distributed to people with disabilities in the Kurunegala District."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/01/42-bottom-trawlers-seized-from-t-nadu-poachers-dfar/,42 bottom trawlers seized from T. Nadu poachers – DFAR,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-01-31T20:33:00+00:00,"Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR) officials said they have seized 42 bottom trawlers from poachers hailing from Tamil Nadu in 2022.  Following the auctioning of approximately 150 bottom trawlers and engine boats in 2022, the DFAR official said the confiscated trawlers rightfully belong to Sri Lanka. A spokesperson from the DFAR’s Investigation and Training Division highlighted yesterday (31) that upon confiscation, the fishing trawlers become the property of the Sri Lankan Government. The official noted that numerous dilapidated trawlers have been auctioned off, stressing that not only is poaching in Sri Lankan waters illegal but the use of bottom trawlers itself is also prohibited. “It’s crucial to understand that both poaching in Sri Lankan waters and employing bottom trawlers are violations of the law,” added the official. Once the fishermen’s arrest is legally initiated, the fishing trawlers are seized and subjected to confiscation through the Magistrate Court, firmly becoming the property of Sri Lanka, the investigator from DFAR said. Several of these vessels face the wrath of typhoons and rough weather while in custody at Navy bases islandwide. Unfortunately, some have succumbed to these conditions, sinking or being dismantled and subsequently auctioned for scrap materials. The official further revealed that, through appeals to the Magistrate, some individuals have successfully retrieved their fishing trawlers. However, any trawlers that remain in Sri Lanka after the stipulated Court-issued time period automatically fall under the ownership of Sri Lanka. The official pointed out that the Tamil Nadu Government has no authority to request the return of these confiscated assets. President of the National Tamil People’s Front (NTPF), A. Kamalanathan, addressed the issue in a letter to Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi, specifically regarding fishing trawlers and other assets confiscated in Sri Lanka due to poaching.   Citing the situation of the fishing boats belonging to Indian fishermen being confiscated by the Sri Lankan Government, the NTPF has urged India to take back those fishing trawlers.  “As you are aware, there have been repeated incidents involving several Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu crossing into Sri Lankan territorial waters for poaching who have been arrested and detained in Sri Lanka,” Kamalanathan said. The depletion of fish stocks within India’s waters has impacted fishermen from India, leaving them with no other alternative but to venture into Sri Lankan territorial waters, claimed Kamalanathan. He added that it had impacted the livelihoods of the Sri Lankan Tamil fishing community of the North and East.   The fishing boats belonging to Indian fishermen from the State of Tamil Nadu that have been confiscated left in a terrible condition. The boats are not secure and there have been incidents of theft of the boat parts which the law enforcement authorities in Sri Lanka have failed to address, he alleged. This has had an adverse impact on the livelihoods of the Tamil Nadu fishermen, with the boats not being returned to them as well.  The NTPF said the Tamil Nadu Government should engage in a constructive dialogue with the Sri Lankan Government to come to a meaningful and amicable settlement that will put an end to the fishing community’s plight from both sides and urged them to find a permanent solution. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has voiced profound concern over the “troubling pattern” of Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu being arrested. He urged the Central Government to re-establish a collaborative working group and underscored the urgent necessity for diplomatic initiatives to address the ongoing situation. In a letter addressed to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Chief Minister Stalin highlighted the recent arrest of six fishermen from Ramanathapuram District, along with two fishing boats, by the Sri Lanka Navy on 22 January. The fishermen were charged with allegedly trespassing into Sri Lankan waters and taken to the Kranji Navy camp. The fishermen’s dispute has been a long-standing problem that remains unaddressed, with no resolution in sight, despite continuous grievances from fishermen in the North and East of Sri Lanka."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

These regulations will be officially communicated through a Gazette notification that will be issued within next two weeks.  Minister Gunawardena said a specialised committee will be established to formulate recommendations, forming the basis for the Gazette. Various stakeholders, such as the Police and road engineers participated in a recent discussion, led by the Transport Ministry Secretary, on highway accidents. The outcome indicated that a significant number of accidents on the Katunayake–Colombo highway were a result of excessive speeding and attempts to overtake slower vehicles. Minister Gunawardena highlighted additional causes of accidents on Sri Lankan highways, including non-compliance with seat belt and safety gear usage, driving under the influence and violation of road rules.  In response to concerns about lighting on expressways, the Minister clarified that reflective lights, consistent with global practices, are utilised for driver convenience. These regulatory measures come in response to a series of accidents on expressways, notably the recent incident resulting in the demise of former State Minister Sanath Nishantha. The accident in the Kerawalapitiya area on the Colombo-Katunayake expressway was attributed to excessive speeding. Subsequently, another accident occurred on the same expressway, resulting in the death of a foreign tourist, prompting the government to address safety concerns on expressways."

The specific date of departure and the chosen vessel are still pending finalisation and these aspects will be determined through ongoing discussions with the Ministry of Defence.  Wickremasuriya emphasised that the selected warships possess long endurance and are well-suited for operations in the Red Sea.

This initiative, led by the United States, aims to counter Houthi attacks on ships in the region.  Houthis have claimed responsibility for attacking ships in the Red Sea, asserting that they are doing so in solidarity with the Palestinians. They state that this action is in response to the Israeli-Hamas conflict, where Israel has engaged in a military warfare on Gaza to counter the Hamas group that attacked Israel last year. Yesterday (30) Denmark sent a frigate to participate in the US-led coalition. Similarly, the European Union has reached an agreement “in principle” to launch a military operation aimed at securing merchant shipping in the Red Sea. The Pentagon has announced that over 20 countries, including Sri Lanka, have agreed to participate in Operation Prosperity Guardian. The objective is to safeguard commercial traffic against attacks by Yemen’s Houthi movement, it stated. President Ranil Wickremesinghe agreed to send a warship to the Red Sea to join he coalition operation that many countries in the region have joined.  India’s warship, INS Vishakhapatnam, is providing assistance to the British-owned oil tanker Marlin Luanda after it was targeted by a Houthi anti-ship missile. Among the crew of Marlin Luanda in the Red Sea security operation, there are 24 Indian citizens. The series of Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November 2023 has led to a critical disruption in the transportation of commercial cargo, impacting its timely arrival at destinations. Sri Lanka is particularly concerned about the potential increase in the cost of grocery items due to this situation."

This comes as the second survey, following the first one in October 2022. The respondents once again cited the PR industry as being highly competitive with its own challenges, and one-fourth shared positive sentiments that it has improved. Over two-thirds of those surveyed said that clients ‘somewhat’ understand the role and impact of PR, commenting that there is a significant literacy gap in this regard. When asked about which channels clients prefer the most, Print once again topped the list (84pct) followed by Digital, Social Media, TV/Radio, and Email/SMS. Print PR continues to champion, with over half of the respondents citing that ‘Print is very much here’. When asked about which Channels the agencies were promoting, Online (90pct) dominated the list however this was closely followed by Print (87pct), Social Media (71pct), TV/Radio (50pct), Community and o=Outreach (23pct), and Outdoor (13pct). Nearly 80pct of the respondents cited clients engaged mostly with routine PR activities followed by equally weighing towards Reputation Building, Brand Positioning and Product Communications (65pct), with only 34pct on Crisis Response Mitigation, followed by Executive Communications (25pct), Internal Communications (22pct), and ESG, DEI related (19pct). However, their clients are also increasingly seeking Crisis Response PR Strategies (84pct) and Internal Communications (81pct), including ESG and DEI-related activities and Executive Communications. These areas are a key highlight for 2024 and years to come in Sri Lanka, and agencies will need to gear up to bridge skills gaps to be counsel-ready. Respondents stressed the following learning areas to get through 2024, with 69pct rating Social Intelligence, followed very closely by analytics, DEI, ESG, AI, Storytelling, and Domain Specific Knowledge. Proving the PR Value to clients continues to be the most pressing challenge in the PR industry (56pct), followed by Client Acquisition and Talent Retention (47pct), and Securing Coverage and Exposure (31pct). The Diminishing Budgets among clients allocated for PR is the biggest challenge (81pct), followed by Payment Delays (60pct), and Skills Gap (41pct). The challenges their clients were facing included External and Economic Pressures (68pct), Budget Cuts (65pct), Retaining Talent (55pct), Proving ROI to their Leadership (52pct) and Finding Customers and Markets (39pct). Mental Wellness in the PR industry should be a key priority. Over two-thirds surveyed had mixed thoughts on this, and positively nearly half of them said they had a well-balanced approach. However, two-thirds of the respondents cited having experienced poor mental health at some point in 2023. Many stressed that they had to work long hours (29pct) and also often during weekends (29pct). Learning (66pct) followed by Agency Reputation (62pct) was cited as why they work where they work, followed by networking, compensation, and job mobility. 29 out of 32 respondents said they had received training at some point, and a majority of them (83pct) have networked with other peers in the industry in the last twelve months. Self-Learning (84pct) continues to lead, followed by on-the-job training, workshops, events, and related qualifications. Over 80pct stressed that the PR industry needs to work more on Knowledge Sharing. This was followed by Talent and Capacity Building (65pct), Collaboration and Partnerships (62pct), Networking, and Uplifting its Ethical Standards. Many PR agency Leaders and Executives commented that a shift towards Digital Channels is crucial but it should come with the required literacy and ethical framework, and concerns on the widening skills and knowledge gap between experienced PR professionals and freshers need to be addressed, including advocating as a whole on the long-term impact and investment of PR among clients. Some also suggested that social and behavioural research, data-driven skills, transparency in communications, agility and collaboration, tech integration, and continuous learning are paramount to staying ahead in delivering impactful and resonating communications. Country Rep Thanzyl Thajudeen, who is a Board Member of PRCA APAC and Council Member of PRCA, and also sits on the Membership Committee, also extended his heartiest congratulations on the inaugural launch of the local PR Association and believes that the industry will work together collaboratively to address the issues and challenges, and keep evolving to take the industry to a global stage.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Six Sri Lankan fishermen, licensed to fish in the Arabian Sea, were kidnapped by fearful Somali pirates, but had managed to sail to Seychelles, while simultaneously the Combined Marine Force (CMF) operation, conducted by Sri Lankan Navy, Bahrain, Indian and Seychelles coast guards, managed to trace the vessel and jointly thwarted the Somali pirates’ mission of hijacking, while rescuing the Sri Lankan fishermen.  The three Somali pirates on board the Sri Lankan fishing trawler were arrested by the Seychelles Coast Guard and the six fishermen were on their way yesterday afternoon (29) to Victoria Harbour in Seychelles, readying to return to Sri Lanka.  The CMF operation located the vessel said Sri Lanka Navy spokesman Captain Gayan Wickramasuriya. “From the time we were alerted that the fishing trawler was in the custody of the Somalis, we coordinated with the regional countries to trace the vessel’s movement,” he said. He added that they spotted the fishing vessel ‘Topaz’ that was sailing 230 nautical miles north east of Mahe, near Seychelles and were able to get information from them about the hijacked Sri Lankan fishing trawler.  Following that, the Seychelles Government sent two of its surveillance aircraft to locate the fishing trawler that had sailed some 902.48 miles, from the Arabian sea to the Indian ocean.  The fishermen are currently in the custody of the Seychelles Coast Guard, Director General of Fisheries, Susantha Kahawatta told Ceylon Today. Kahawatta further said that it remains unclear how the fishermen managed to leave the Somali region and reach Seychelles. At present, they are on their fishing trawler in Seychelles waters.

COPF Chairman Dr. Harsha de Silva pointed out that despite assurances from the Ministry of Finance, at a previous COPF meeting in September 2023, no institution to regulate the casino business has been established so far. Dr. de Silva expressed concern over the lack of effective communication between the Ministry and relevant institutions, stating that this issue has been brought to their attention multiple times. The COPF Chairman also pointed out a problematic situation regarding the agreement related to the RAMIS system of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), which has not been provided to the Auditor General as yet.  These concerns were raised during a recent meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) also, investigating the delay in implementing recommendations aimed at increasing government revenue, which Dr. de Silva and Finance Ministry officials attended. During this meeting, it was revealed that there are four major casinos in Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Finance is prepared to grant more casino licences.  The intention is to issue new licences to boost foreign exchange earnings, particularly targeting the tourism sector and this will be done through a formal system. The official from the Ministry of Finance acknowledged the lack of proper regulation for existing casinos, leading to improper collection of taxes owed to the government.  While the Casino Business (Regulation) Act No. 17 of 2010 and the Betting and Gaming Tax Act No. 40 of 1988 provide provisions for regulating the casino industry, the necessary orders to enforce these provisions have not been issued and as result no licence has been issued to a casino establishment under this Act so far.  In response to these issues, the Cabinet has approved the issuance of orders under the Casino Business (Regulation) Act No. 17 of 2010 and the introduction of necessary amendments to the Betting and Gaming Tax Act No. 40 of 1988.

The initial information about this plant surfaced from a temple in Katugastota, Kandy and it is now being sold in various business places.  In light of the Gazette Notification associated with the Plant Protection Act, the import of all aquatic plants or seeds to the country is prohibited. Therefore, the botanical experts emphasised the need for an investigation into how the Victoria Lily was brought into the country. The Plant Protection Act has prohibited the import of aquatic plants or seeds to the country since 2 November 1981. The experts asserted that the introduction of this particular plant has violated these regulations. According to experts, if this plant is released into the environment, it could pose a serious threat to other valuable plants and the survival of fish. Senior environmentalist and environmental lawyer Dr. Jagath Gunawardena highlighted that the plant, also known scientifically as Victoria amazonica, can grow up to three feet or 90 to 1,000 centimetres in height. While it is suitable for cultivation in large ponds or tanks, efforts should be made to prevent its release into the natural environment. Dr. Gunawardena warned that the release of this plant could have a detrimental impact on the growth of other aquatic plants.  The Victoria Lily is known for its rapid spread, with one plant producing many seeds, contributing to its swift growth. Dr. Gunawardena emphasised the need to control the growth of this plant, describing it as an invasive species that should not be allowed to grow indiscriminately."

The electricity disconnection was conducted by the Lanka Electricity Private Company Limited (LECO), which is responsible for supplying electricity to the city of Galle and its surroundings. Mapalagama explained that when he visited the LECO office to settle his electricity bill of Rs 6,650.18, the cashier informed him that it was not necessary to pay the 18 cents as such a small amount would not lead to a disconnection.   Therefore, he paid Rs 6650 on 19 December 2023, leaving the remaining 18 cents unpaid. To his surprise, a few days later, while no one was at home, LECO disconnected the electricity at his residence. Upon his return, he found a power cut notice indicating an additional fee of Rs. 1,231 and the outstanding 18 cents be paid for re-connection. Upon inquiry at the LECO office in Richmond Hill, Galle, Mapalagama faced difficulty obtaining a clear explanation. An officer mentioned the absence of a responsible person, including the electrical engineer and failed to provide contact information for further clarification. Expressing his frustration, Mapalagama threatened legal action against LECO. Subsequently, an official from the LECO acknowledged the mistake over a phone call and admitted to a serious error made by them and other officials. The official explained that, according to the current computerised system, electricity can be cut off even for an unpaid cent.  However, the officials assured that they would review the system and only disconnect bills exceeding outstanding amount of Rs 10,000. The disconnection procedure for underpaid bills of 18 cents was an oversight that was promptly rectified and the electricity connection was restored on the same day without imposing any additional charges."

Amaraweera made this announcement during a media briefing at the President’s Media Division (PMD) yesterday (29). He emphasised the collective efforts of farmers and government initiatives as the driving force behind this achievement, highlighting the nation’s reduced dependence on rice imports. To achieve this self-sufficiency, the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries implemented targeted programmes, including substantial financial investments in fertiliser subsidies. In 2023, Rs 22 billion was allocated for fertiliser subsidies during the Yala and Maha seasons, along with Rs 13 billion for the direct purchase of paddy from farmers. The dedication to these initiatives paid off, resulting in Sri Lanka achieving rice self-sufficiency in 2023. This success underscores the resilience and effectiveness of the government’s efforts in agricultural development. However, challenges such as drought and floods affected paddy cultivation, leading to losses for farmers. The government allocated one billion rupees to compensate for drought-related losses, with ongoing efforts to address flood-damaged farms. The recent surge in vegetable prices, driven by heavy rains, prompted the government to provide farmers with ‘net houses’ to protect crops. While not a complete solution, this initiative aims to mitigate the impact of heavy rains on vegetable production. Looking ahead, the government focuses on boosting national food security through targeted crop production. In 2024, key crops – paddy, maize, potato, and chilli – are prioritised to meet specific national goals, with a renewed focus on red onion cultivation to diversify Sri Lanka’s agricultural landscape. The Ministry has launched crucial initiatives to revitalise the plantation sector, focusing on tea, rubber and coconut crops. The B60 policy, implemented on 1 January 2024, aims to enhance the quality of tea leaves, a vital aspect of maintaining Sri Lanka’s global reputation for excellence."

Since then, Trincomalee has been the principal Naval station to the nation from where the Sri Lanka Navy has embarked on numerous missions and gained victories to safeguard national interest. “Please remember that you had been trained in the backdrop of this historical value, hence, your future is shaped by the events to discharge duties diligently and with dignity. “In conclusion let me recite a poem from our childhood: uf,a uf,a ;eô,sh jekak fmd,a  uf,a /f,a /f,a uQÈka ouk Èh /f,a nf,a nf,a rdisx fohshkafka  nf,a .,ska fldgqj nekaohs    ;sßl=Kduf,a I wish the new officers the best in their future And May the blessings of the Noble Triple Gem be with You.”"

Kumudesh alleged that investigations being conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), with regard to the questionable immunoglobulin transaction, up to now had been unable to unravel information regarding the fake WoR certificate. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry was not paying adequate attention to documents similar to the fake WoR certificates that were currently circulating on social media, he lamented.  The JCPSM President alleged that it was suspected that fake certificates had been issued in a similar manner in relation to importing medicinal drugs such as Povidone iodine, Captopril, Bisoprolol, Desferal, Fluticasone, Prednisolone.  He noted that what was unique about the situation was that all those medicines were from local pharmaceutical suppliers. He appealed to the CID therefore to look into the specifics about these fake certificates and the need for them. While several medicinal drug scams, which occurred in the State health service were being revealed, what needs to be revealed, is the source of these fake documents that had been issued. He alleged that certain decisions that were being taken by the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), was imposing regulations only for local production companies so much so that there were strong suspicions about whether there was a conspiracy to discourage local production of pharmaceuticals, the JCPSM President alleged. ​ Kumudesh said that the National Movement of Health Professionals had complained to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), about the false certificates issued for medicinal drug registration. He said the National Movement had been to the CID to lodge the complaint while submitting several more fake certificates, allegedly said to have been issued by the NMRA, for investigation purposes. "

Director General of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department, Susantha Kahawatta said ‘Lorenzo Putha 4’, which set sail from Dikowita fishing harbour on 12 January, was hijacked by an armed group in the afternoon of Saturday (27), while in the Arabian Sea.  According to Kahawatta, while ‘Lorenzo Putha 4’ was engaged in fishing activities on Saturday (27), a vessel with armed individuals followed it. The crew initially mistook the vessel for a coast guard ship. Two armed men from the pursuing vessel boarded ‘Lorenzo Putha 4’, fired shots into the air and seized control of the crew and the vessel. During the pursuit, nearby vessels left the scene, and Lorenzo Putha 4’s communication equipment was turned off. The hijacked vessel was taken to another location. While it remains unclear who hijacked the fishing vessel, reports from other vessels suggest that it may have been done by Somali or other rebel groups. The Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources is collaborating with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy to coordinate efforts to rescue the fishing vessel, Kahawatta said. "

Stalin cited the increase in Value Added Tax (VAT) as a key factor leading to a surge in the prices of school stationery. This escalation, rendering many items unaffordable, he noted, had placed significant financial strain on the average citizen.  Expressing concern, Stalin stated that the government’s taxation policy may force parents at the grassroots level to withdraw their children from school due to the escalating cost of living. The CTU General Secretary called upon the government to consider a Rs 20,000 increase in the salaries of school teachers and principals to help cope with the rising cost of living. He expressed dissatisfaction with the imposition of educational expenses on parents in an unbearable manner. Considering these issues, the CTU is contemplating the possibility of organising widespread protests after the commencement of schools. Stalin accused the government of passing even school electricity bills onto parents through the school development committee. The prices of school textbooks, footwear and other learning accessories have surged to levels unaffordable for the average person. If the government fails to implement alternative measures, the collapse of the education system in the country would be inevitable, added Stalin."

However, concerns persist regarding delays in implementing governance and transparency reforms. Facing its most severe economic crisis in decades, Sri Lanka obtained a critical USD 2.9 billion loan from the IMF in March 2023. Verité Research, monitoring Sri Lanka’s progress under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, through its online platform ‘IMF Tracker’, reports that out of the 73 commitments due by the end of November 2023, 60 have been met, albeit with some delays. Nonetheless, 13 commitments remain unmet, raising apprehensions about Sri Lanka’s dedication to crucial reforms. Among these, five have been irreversibly missed and cannot be carried forward, while eight have been deferred to the second phase of the programme leading up to the next IMF review. Adding complexity to the situation, the IMF has adjusted due dates for an additional 27 commitments initially set for after November, categorising them as ‘pending’ alongside the eight carried-forward obligations. Additionally, Sri Lanka and the IMF have introduced 75 new commitments to the programme. As a result, the second phase of the EFF begins with a substantial 110 commitments hanging in the balance. Notably, four specific governance and transparency-related commitments remain unmet, including the launch of an online transparency platform for public procurement and tax exemptions and the establishment of a merit-based selection process for directors of the anti-corruption commission."

His motorcycle, suspected to have been used for this purpose, was also seized. This development follows two recent arrests in Galle. The Beliatta mass murders occurred on 22 January 2024, near the Beliatta entrance of the Southern Expressway. Five individuals, including the leader of the Ape Janbala Party, Saman Perera, lost their lives in a targeted shooting. The assailants, armed with T-56 guns, ambushed the victims as they entered a local hotel in a Defender-type jeep. A second jeep arrived from behind, and the attackers swiftly approached the victims, opening fire. Saman Perera, a candidate in the 2020 general election, was specifically targeted and chased down, succumbed to gunshot wounds. Four others were fatally shot on the spot and another victim passed away in hospital. Past incidents involving the victims have drawn attention, with some having been previously arrested for their involvement in a shooting incident in 2022. The investigations have revealed that the key suspect, a 54-year-old businessman, with a history of criminal convictions, was behind the murders. Initial findings suggest collaboration with another individual and disturbing indications of involvement by organised criminal elements operating from abroad. The Criminal Investigation Department, Colombo Crime Division, and Police Special Task Force are collaborating in the investigations. The recovery of the Pajero-type jeep, used in the attack and the subsequent seizing of a motorcycle and van in Akuressa, Bathgama, have provided crucial evidence, shedding light on the premeditated nature of the crime. The motorcycle served as both a means of transportation for the assailants and a vehicle to transport lethal weapons, while the van was prepared for a quick escape after the shooting. These developments mark significant strides forward in the investigation into the heinous assassination of Saman Perera and four associates."

The man, in question, had operated a pyramid-style financial institution named ‘TredWin Share’ in the Galenbindunuwewa. Residing with his partner, who is said to be a tele actress, in Pilimathalawa, Kandy, the couple was found to have been leading a lavish lifestyle, acquiring real estate and vehicles with the illicitly obtained funds. The suspect’s partner was arrested on charges related to investing the fraudulently acquired money. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) submitted their findings to the Court, stating that the suspect had been evading the authorities for two years, refusing to cooperate with Police investigations. The CID mentioned that the suspect had acquired numerous undisclosed properties and due to ongoing investigations, details about these properties couldn’t be submitted to the Court at the present juncture. Over 180 farmers filed complaints related to the incident, leading to a protest organised in Kahatagasdigiliya in July 2023. The CID argued that remanding the suspect in custody was necessary to prevent potential public disturbances if bail was granted. In response, the defence lawyers argued for the suspect’s release on bail, contending that holding a protest did not constitute a public disturbance. They assured the Court of their cooperation and willingness to attend proceedings whenever required, requesting the Court to grant bail to the suspect."

The Board has been monitoring the situation since the suspension and are now satisfied that SLC are no longer in breach of membership obligations,” the ICC said in a statement.  On 10 November, the ICC had suspended SLC’s membership, citing serious breaches of its obligations as a member, particularly the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and prevent government interference in the governance, regulation and administration of cricket in Sri Lanka. After a meeting of the ICC Board on 21 November, it was decided that Sri Lanka could continue to participate in international cricket, both bilateral and ICC events, despite the suspension. However, the ICC would control funding to SLC and Sri Lanka would no longer host the ICC U19 Men’s Cricket World Cup 2024, which would now take place in South Africa, according to the ICC’s statement. Consequently, South Africa replaced Sri Lanka as the host for the 15th edition of the ICC Men’s U19 Cricket World Cup 2024 due to the suspension. In November last year, Fernando’s predecessor Roshan Ranasinghe had wanted to replace the entire SLC board with an interim committee headed by former captain Arjuna Ranatunga. However, the move was stayed by the country’s Court of Appeal. The ICC subsequently suspended SLC, a decision that had the support of some Lankan officials. The controversy surrounding SLC’s internal committees eventually cost Ranasinghe his ministerial portfolios, hours after he claimed that his “life is at risk” for “highlighting corruption” in the country’s chaotic cricket administration and said that if anything happens to him, President Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Chief-of-Staff Sagala Ratnayake should be held responsible."

The war situation in the Middle East has prompted shipping companies to choose the port of Colombo as a safer alternative due to terrorist threats against merchant ships navigating through the Suez Canal to the Red Sea. Consequently, berthing facilities for 24 ships have been made available in the harbour today, with an additional 10 ships reported to be waiting outside the harbor for anchorage. In light of these developments, both the Jayabahalu Terminal (JCT) and Eastern Container Terminal (ECT) have collectively handled approximately 100 ships during the month of January.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The draft bill, having received clearance from the Attorney General, is set to be published and presented to Parliament for approval, marking a significant stride towards rectifying this legal gap and enhancing safeguards against sexual offences. The need to introduce amendments to the Penal Code, to recognise male rape as a criminal offence, was discussed in the Cabinet in meetings held on 18 January 2021 and 28 June 2021, and received approval.  Current laws solely define men as perpetrators of rape. According to Article 363 of the Penal Code, a man is said to commit rape when he has sexual intercourse with a woman under any of the following descriptions. Moreover, the prohibition of statutory rape is exclusively directed towards girls under the age of 16, omitting boys from its coverage (Section 363(e) of the Penal Code outlines conditions for statutory rape, specifying “with or without her consent when she is under sixteen years of age.”  Furthermore, acts of sexual violence, falling outside the scope of rape, are expressly prohibited by Section 365 B of the Penal Code, addressing ‘grave sexual abuse.’ This provision defines such abuse as any act committed by individuals for sexual gratification, utilising their genitals, any other part of the human body, or any instrument on any orifice or part of another person’s body without consent or under force, threat, or intimidation.  While this section could potentially be utilised to prosecute male rape and other forms of sexual violence against men and boys, it imposes a lesser sentence than rape under Article 363."

Consumers in Matale expressed concerns about a significant and sudden surge in the price of polos. The cost of polos, which was previously sold at Rs 30 to 40 per the entire fruit, soared to Rs 100 per kilo, according to their claims. Traders in Matale attributed this increase in polos prices to various factors, including a diminished yield resulting from the ongoing rains and increased transportation costs. Despite these justifications, residents from several villages in the Matale District, renowned for polos production, reported a growing number of vendors purchasing polos in bulk daily. Paradoxically, they also highlighted the challenge of meeting this escalating demand as there was a shortage of polos in their plantations."

The Judge further sentenced the seven convicts to 29 years Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) on six indictments, besides the death sentence, three other indictments filed against them, while imposing a fine of Rs 2,008,500, each. The Court also announced that besides the death penalty that has been imposed, the prison terms slapped on the convicts should also be served simultaneously. In October 2012, the convicts had hijacked a fishing boat ‘Thejan’, off Tangalle, and killed three fishermen aboard, while critically injuring several others in order to illegally migrate to Australia. Following a lengthy trial, Judge Patabendige, announcing the verdict, said the charges levelled against the accused, have been proved beyond any reasonable doubt. He thus convicted them over the charges, filed against them and passed the death sentence. Meanwhile, a female accused in the case, who was the 10th defendant was acquitted and released from the trial. The then-Attorney General had filed the case in 2013, against 11 individuals, based on 14 charges. As three of them had died in litigation, the proceedings of the case were continued against eight defendants."

Responding to a query from Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa in Parliament, Siyambalapitiya informed that documents have been submitted to the Attorney General for prosecution and that the Attorney General’s response has already been received.  He also disclosed that the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) conducted a forensic audit on 12 institutions, recovering Rs 310 million from profits linked to the scam involving six companies. Premadasa said, “The Government reduced the sugar tax from Rs 50+ to 25 cents per kg. However, this move resulted in a loss of Rs 16 billion to the State, as indicated in the audit report submitted to the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA). Despite more than ten months passing since the report being handed over to the CID, there has been no visible progress in the investigations.” Further, the special audit report highlighted a significant loss to the State caused by the baseless suspension of the light railway project granted by Japan. Over a year has elapsed since this report was presented to Parliament, yet no step has been taken.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Police said following the arrest two days later and questioning the main suspect behind the mass shooting they had located the SUV. According to initial investigations it was found that after shooting the victims, the suspect who had driven the SUV on the main road to Galle had then parked it at the Vidyaloka Pirivena and had then bought a Rs 50 ticket to see a patient being admitted to the Cooperative Hospital. SSP Matara had then visited the temple car park to inspect the SUV and told media that they have already identified the rest of the suspects behind the shooting and noted that they were part of an organised gang who were well trained in handling firearms. In the shooting, which took place between 8:30 a.m. and 8:40 a.m., four persons were killed at the scene including the Leader of the Ape Janabala Pakshaya, Saman Perera.

A celebration was held today to mark the 25th anniversary of the Homagama Plant Virus Identification Centre along with the introduction of these new varieties. The Minister handed over the two new varieties to farmers for cultivation. The special feature of these two varieties is that the lifespan of a pomegranate tree is over 30 years, and one tree can harvest 20-25 kg of pomegranates per year. 400 trees can be planted per acre, which can generate an annual income of Rs eight million per acre. These two types of pomegranates are suitable for cultivation in the dry zone, and because these can be used as an alternative to the currently imported red pomegranate varieties, the cost of pomegranate imports could be reduced in our country, Amaraweera said.  The Minister further advised the Department to focus on promoting exportable crops to prevent the further import of agricultural crops which can be grown in this country but are imported."

He said this when the case related to the immunoglobulin scam was taken up in the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court.  Gunaratne, PC emphasised that the Attorney General’s duty is not to shield individuals in the Cabinet but to ensure justice for the aggrieved parties in this case. The bail order for the remanded suspects in this case, scheduled for issuance yesterday (24), was postponed to 1 February as Chief Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama was unable to preside over the Court due to health conditions. Thus, the suspects including former Health Secretary Janaka Sri Chandragupta were further remanded till 1 February by Acting Magistrate Himali Ekanayake.  Upul Jayasuriya, PC prayed the Court to send hundreds of vials of immunoglobulin related to the case to the Department of Microbiology at the Sri Lanka Medical College for bacterial analysis and a subsequent report. President’s Counsel Maithri Gunaratne prayed the Court to allow expert Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa to act on behalf of the aggrieved parties. Similarly, Upul Jayasuriya, PC sought the Court’s permission for the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) to represent the aggrieved party. Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, opposed the requests made by Gunaratne and Jayasuriya PCs, stating that they lack the legal capacity to represent the aggrieved parties. She said they need to obtain Court approval to appear for the aggrieved parties. Gunaratne, PC criticised the delay in arresting three individuals related to the case despite Court orders. He also raised concerns about the submission of a Cabinet document related to medicine procurement against the President’s instructions. He said it is essential to produce the former Health Minister as a suspect due to discrepancies in the document, including the unauthorised use of the minister’s signature. The Deputy Solicitor General refuted Gunaratne’s claim that the Attorney General’s Department ignored Court orders, clarifying that no warrants were issued against the said three individuals and arrests were made based on findings during investigations. She assured the Court that all relevant documents related to the questionable incident from 30 May 2022 to 5 December 2022, have been submitted."

Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, Mahinda Amaraweera, recently, visited the Lunuwila CRI to witness this invention. The Minister observed the coconut saplings produced by using a fine part of a coconut flower in research tubes. In our traditional coconut cultivation system, a large space is needed to grow coconut seedlings, but in the research laboratory, coconut seedlings were grown in a glass tube measuring about six inches. Dr. Ranasinghe, Head of Department  Dr. Vijitha Vidanarachchi and a group of scientists led this research team. Most countries that grow coconut plants use tissue culture technology, but they use coconut pulp for this purpose. No country has prepared coconut saplings using parts from the unopened female flower. Therefore, the production of coconut plants by the ‘Clonal Plant’ tissue culture method carried out by the Lunuwila Coconut Research Institute in their laboratories has been very successful. The minister, who held discussions with officials, expressed his view regarding the use of this new technology to produce King Coconut seedlings, as there is a huge demand for King Coconut both locally and globally. Dr. Ranasinghe said the Lunuwila Coconut Research Institute has already started producing King Coconut plants using this new technology. The Minister also mentioned that the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries will take steps to provide the necessary financial allocations to produce as many coconut and orange seedlings as possible utilising this method. He also expressed his gratitude to all the scientists who introduced this new technology and showed that Sri Lanka is ahead of other countries in this sphere."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/25/sri-lanka-is-still-a-work-in-progress/,‘Sri Lanka is still a work in progress’,Author not found,0,2024-01-24T20:32:00+00:00,"Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, addressing the Cambridge Union on 23 January, said Sri Lanka is still a work in progress when considering our most critical aim: forging together the diversity of our people into one coherent and strong Sri Lankan nation. Following is his full speech:  It is an honour to stand before this distinguished audience at the Cambridge Union today. Your Union invited me to share my insight as a lawyer and a lawmaker, and I am grateful for this opportunity to address you all. I come from Sri Lanka, which, due to its strategic location at the intersection of maritime trade routes and sea lanes, has historically attracted the interest of global superpowers. Prior to gaining independence in 1948, Sri Lanka was under colonial rule for around 500 years. Though the colonial era’s legacy of exploitation and division left an indelible mark on our nation, we can’t disregard its positive contributions, such as introducing democracy, the rule of law, a strong independent judiciary, a robust civil service and essential infrastructure. At the threshold of independence, it was up to the leaders of the diverse, multicultural, and newly independent Sri Lanka to build on those fundamentals and create a stable, peaceful and prosperous nation for all its citizens. Democracy is undoubtedly the most desirable form of governance, yet, in my opinion, it has three major inherent challenges to overcome. Firstly, to desist from the temptation to exploit societal differences for electoral gains. Secondly, to resist unsustainable populist economic policies in furtherance of vote bank politics. Finally, there is the challenge of maintaining basic policy consistency across government and party lines. The relative economic and social progress that democracies have achieved globally can be directly attributed to how well the leaders within those countries tackled these three challenges. Looking back at the last 75 years, as an independent nation, Sri Lanka has worked diligently to ensure the social upliftment of its people. We have addressed the challenges of literacy, nutrition, education and social welfare, achieving significant progress in these areas. Sri Lanka provides universal free healthcare and free education to all its citizens. Since the universal adult franchise was conferred on Sri Lanka in 1931, we have consistently maintained a peaceful transfer of power, separation of powers and an independent judiciary to safeguard the rule of law. While we take pride in our achievements, we must also have the humility to accept our failures. We are still a work in progress when considering our most critical aim: forging together the diversity of our people into one coherent and strong Sri Lankan nation. We have faltered along the way in the last 75 years. We have permitted our differences to gain prominence and dominate the social fabric, subsequently failing to nurture the commonalities that bind us together. Sri Lanka has a vibrant and independent judiciary, but much cannot be said of its efficacy and efficiency. As a citizen and lawyer, I have been constantly troubled by the perennial issue of law delays, which have plagued the efficient and equitable administration of justice. A routine lack of investment in the legal system, the failure to regularly review and revisit old laws, and the reluctance to embrace technology have been its root causes. For example, by 2019, Sri Lanka had approximately 1 million cases to be heard by 336 judges in all courts. When divided by the population, this works out to 15 judges for every 1 million citizens, whereas advanced jurisdictions have a ratio ranging from 40 to 150 judges per million citizens. As the saying goes, justice delayed is justice denied. Law’s delays have a direct negative impact on the rule of law, social cohesion, investment and the economic advancement of a nation.  “My country, right or wrong; if right, to be kept right; and if wrong, to be set right.” Even though some people find this saying to be controversial, its inner meaning— emphasising the responsibility of a citizen in nation-building—has always inspired me. I was invited to take over the Ministry of Justice, and although politics was not my cup of tea, I saw this as an opportunity to actively overhaul the systems I had been limited to critiquing from the sidelines. When I took over as Minister of Justice, I realised the solution needed to be holistic. I focused on five specific areas: 1. Securing sufficient funds for the justice sector 2. Improving the infrastructure of the legal system 3. Embracing technology, particularly digitisation 4. Increasing the number of judges 5. Reform of the law covering the areas of criminal law reform, civil law reform and commercial law reform In a relatively short period, our initiatives resulted in significant success, entailing an increase in the number of judges in courthouses, the introduction of online hearings and the commencement of the process of amending and introducing over a hundred laws. In early 2022, while our focus was on judicial reforms, Sri Lanka was facing the worst economic crisis since its independence and it threatened to completely unravel the nation. Years of unsustainable populist policies, the accumulation of severe debt burdens, a refusal to make rational and prudent economic decisions and a lack of political will to meaningfully combat the menace of corruption made this inevitable. External shocks such as Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine hastened the process. Amidst the rapid depreciation of the rupee, inflation was skyrocketing. Forex shortages curbed essential imports. Long queues for cooking gas and fuel, together with extended power cuts never seen in recent history, brought the Sri Lankan public to their knees.  They were outraged, and rightly so. Demonstrations and agitations against the Government became an almost daily occurrence, and growing tensions reached a breaking point. The resulting chaos compelled me to change course and take over the Ministry of Finance. There were no takers for this unenviable job, but I did not want to abandon my country at one of its most decisive moments in history. In addressing Parliament, I decided to take a different approach. I told the public the uncomfortable truth about our economy, referring to shocking statistical data to highlight Sri Lanka’s deeply troubling financial position. We decided to replace crucial decision-making bureaucrats with technocrats committed to the reform process. We commenced critical negotiations with the IMF, the World Bank and other multilateral development banks. We initiated the debt restructuring process to attain debt sustainability and advocated for and introduced cost-reflective pricing to ensure an unimpeded supply of essential items. As unlocking the IMF’s extended fund facility was not immediate, the challenge was to secure bridge financing to ensure the economy did not collapse beyond repair. The repurposing of the funds from multilaterals and the support extended by the Government of India at that crucial hour provided us with a lifeline. While the reforms were taking shape, the public was in no mood to compromise. Continuous agitation and uprisings by the public resulted in President Gotabaya Rajapaksa relinquishing office. The subsequent constitutional process led to President Ranil Wickremesinghe succeeding in his place. President Wickremesinghe, a seasoned politician with wide-ranging experience, swiftly took control of the situation and adopted a dual strategy. The restoration of law and order and crucial economic reforms were pursued with renewed vigour and purpose. On assuming office, President Wickremesinghe tasked me with taking over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to navigate Sri Lanka’s foreign policy through the tumultuous waters of global power rivalry. This was put to the test due to Sri Lanka’s intricate debt restructuring process, which required assurances from multiple major powers. As an emerging economy, we pursued an independent foreign policy strategy, reaching out to a diverse spectrum of international allies in both the East and the West. The Western-based Paris Club, which includes Japan, India and China, constantly supported our effort to secure an Extended Fund Facility with the IMF as well as our debt restructuring process required to attain debt sustainability. We believe our independent yet multi-aligned foreign policy has helped us navigate these difficult challenges and obtain the support of the larger international community. Eighteen months later, Sri Lanka’s inflation, which was 70 per cent in September 2022, has come down to less than 5 per cent in August 2023. The rupee had stabilised and, in fact, appreciated by about 15 per cent from its peak against the US dollar. Remittances have seen a 60 per cent annual growth in 2023. Tourism has seen an annual growth of 106 per cent in the year 2023; usable forex reserves, which were at USD 20 million in April 2022, have gone up to USD 4.5 billion in January 2024. We are not out of the woods yet, but Sri Lankans have shown tremendous resilience in weathering this very challenging period. If we successfully resist divisive policies and embrace the unity within our diversity, if we continue these difficult yet prudent economic policy reforms, and if we maintain policy consistency across government and political party lines, I honestly believe Sri Lanka is within touching distance of achieving its true potential. Let me conclude with the following quote: “A stone is broken by the last stroke of a hammer. This doesn’t mean that the first stroke is useless. Success is the result of continuous and persistent efforts.” I sincerely wish that my contribution could make a small dent in the profound debt of gratitude that I owe my country."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, Mahinda Amaraweera, recently, visited the Lunuwila CRI to witness this invention. The Minister observed the coconut saplings produced by using a fine part of a coconut flower in research tubes. In our traditional coconut cultivation system, a large space is needed to grow coconut seedlings, but in the research laboratory, coconut seedlings were grown in a glass tube measuring about six inches. Dr. Ranasinghe, Head of Department  Dr. Vijitha Vidanarachchi and a group of scientists led this research team. Most countries that grow coconut plants use tissue culture technology, but they use coconut pulp for this purpose. No country has prepared coconut saplings using parts from the unopened female flower. Therefore, the production of coconut plants by the ‘Clonal Plant’ tissue culture method carried out by the Lunuwila Coconut Research Institute in their laboratories has been very successful. The minister, who held discussions with officials, expressed his view regarding the use of this new technology to produce King Coconut seedlings, as there is a huge demand for King Coconut both locally and globally. Dr. Ranasinghe said the Lunuwila Coconut Research Institute has already started producing King Coconut plants using this new technology. The Minister also mentioned that the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries will take steps to provide the necessary financial allocations to produce as many coconut and orange seedlings as possible utilising this method. He also expressed his gratitude to all the scientists who introduced this new technology and showed that Sri Lanka is ahead of other countries in this sphere."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/25/illicit-trade-of-tobacco-products/,Illicit trade of tobacco products,Author not found,0,2024-01-24T20:31:00+00:00,"The term ‘Illicit tobacco trade,’ as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), encompasses “any practice or conduct prohibited by law pertaining to tobacco production, shipment, receipt, possession, distribution, sale or purchase, including activities intended to facilitate such illicit endeavours.” Illicit trade comprises three categories of products: namely, smuggled products, counterfeits and illicit whites. With growing evidence, it is no secret that the tobacco industry is intricately connected to tobacco smuggling, employing this as a widespread strategy on a global scale. According to reporting from the WHO and the University of Bath, internal company documents reveal that in the 1990s smuggling was an integral part of the business strategies of the tobacco industry. The exposure of this strategy in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to public investigations, Court cases and extremely negative publicity for the tobacco companies. Using a massive public relations drive, they claimed that they are the victims, not the perpetrators of tobacco smuggling. But contemporary evidence indicates significant ongoing tobacco company involvement in the illicit tobacco trade. Why would the tobacco industry smuggle their own products? For decades, multi-national tobacco companies have been engaged in smuggling their own product, thereby safeguarding their financial interests. The tobacco industry engages in smuggling to obtain the following benefits: – To impede tax or price increases on tobacco products. – To earn profits through their products, regardless of whether they are smuggled or not. – To argue against tobacco control policies claiming that every policy will increase tobacco smuggling. – The reduced average market price as a result of smuggling discourages quitting and increases total sales for the industry. – Illegal sales undermine tobacco control measures (packaging laws, age restrictions on sales). – The industry also uses smuggling as a market entry strategy. Tobacco tax increases and exaggerations on illicit trade through media and research Similar to the situation in Sri Lanka at present, when a proposal is presented to increase the excise duty for tobacco products, it is a common strategy used by the tobacco industry to make exaggerated claims about the size and scope of the illicit tobacco trade in that country, such as the following: Tobacco tax increases will inevitably result in an increase in the illicit trade in tobacco products. The presence of an illicit tobacco market will actually reduce revenue collection following a tax increase. With the implementation of the tobacco tax increase by 20 per cent in July 2023 and 14 per cent on 1 January 2024, the above arguments have been amplified through media channels, giving rise to a heightened discourse on the subject of illicit trade. Apart from the media publicity given to the topic of illicit trade, certain research studies emphasise the fact that increased taxes or prices of tobacco products prompt consumers to turn to more economical alternatives, thereby leading to increased illicit tobacco trade, causing substantial revenue losses for the Government. The arguments conveyed in these studies are clearly similar to the arguments presented by the tobacco industry regarding tobacco tax, potentially misleading readers. However, despite the tax increases, government revenue has continued to rise. Further, recent reports assert that tobacco smuggling is more than 20 per cent in Sri Lanka. However, it is crucial to scrutinise the credibility of these figures, as they primarily rely on vague sources such as industry-generated data and market sources. Unfortunately, such sources are inherently unreliable, given their vested interest in presenting inflated numbers which are in favour of the tobacco industry. Also, there are doubts surrounding the individuals or organisations funding such research endeavours. Contrastingly, official statistics from Customs reveal that only less than 1 per cent of smuggled tobacco has been captured. Should the reported incidence of smuggling stand at the aforementioned 20 per cent, it presents a strong need to enhance regulatory measures aimed at discouraging and mitigating the illicit tobacco trade. In accordance with existing literature, it is evident that tax and price fluctuations represent just one driving factor behind tobacco smuggling. Additional contributing factors include the variances in prices of legitimate products among different nations and the inadequacy of penalties associated with tobacco smuggling. Further to the above, the Sri Lankan Government signed the international treaty of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products on 8 February 2016. Consequently, proactive measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks associated with all the drivers of smuggling, as the Sri Lankan Government has an obligation to eliminate illicit tobacco products.

The suspects orchestrated the crime by enticing the victim to a residence in Villorawatta where they stripped and assaulted him and then robbed him. According to Moratumulla Police, one suspect enticed the victim through the online dating app ‘Grinder’ under the guise of offering a body massage. Upon the victim’s arrival at the Villorawatta house, guided by the suspect’s location, the youth unclothed himself and coerced the victim to do the same. Subsequently, additional suspects forcefully entered the premises, accusing the victim of sexual misconduct against the youth. They threatened to report the incident to the police. Under duress, the victim’s Debit Card and PIN were obtained, resulting in the withdrawal of Rs 70,000 and an additional Rs 29,000 using his Credit Card. Prompted by a complaint, the Police conducted an investigation leading to the arrest of the suspects from Villorawatta, Rawatawatte, and Lakshapathiya areas. Further investigations have uncovered similar instances of robbery involving suspects targeting an Army Major and a student in the past."

The minister further said this progress was easily achieved by making necessary changes to the top management and assigning responsibilities properly. The Minister added, the integration of all the institutions related to the Education Ministry under one umbrella of the Ministry was a major support for the success of the SPC. He disclosed that it was possible to solve the problems that existed until now in printing school textbooks and delivering them to the children at the right time.  It was also stated that it was possible to develop the SPC to such a positive level by intervening to hand them over for printing and providing the necessary support.

Minister of State for Fisheries Piyal Nishantha de Silva launched the initiative. The inaugural phase is set to commence on 26 January at the Wellamankaraya Fishery Port in Wennappuwa. Addressing the challenges faced by fishermen, the Minister emphasised the significance of the initiative in mitigating health-related issues during sea expeditions. Falling ill at sea has posed a major concern, often requiring assistance from foreign countries or the Sri Lankan Navy, incurring substantial financial costs. The ‘Dheevara Suva Saviya’ programme is designed to address these challenges comprehensively. It mandates all fishermen to undergo thorough medical examinations and obtain a medical certificate from designated government hospitals near each fishing port. The certificate, valid for two years, is to be renewed biennially. The phased implementation will initially cover captains of multi-day vessels, followed by the entire crew and eventually all fishermen across the country. A crucial aspect of the programme involves providing first aid training and certification for all fishermen, to ensure that at least one individual on each vessel is a certified First Aid Trainee. Training is conducted by the Sri Lanka Navy’s Medical Corps. Additionally, every fishing vessel will be equipped with a first aid kit containing essential medicines and emergency equipment, following recommendations from the Ministry of Health. This collaborative effort, involving the Ministry of Fisheries, the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, the Ministry of Health, and the Sri Lanka Navy, aims to deploy only fit and healthy fishermen for work, reducing the risk to their lives and minimising expenses associated with transporting sick fishermen. The ‘Dheevara Suva Saviya’ initiative marks a significant step to enhance the overall health and well-being of the fishing community in Sri Lanka, the Minister said."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/24/health-ministry-takes-second-u-turn-on-dat/,Health Ministry Takes Second U-turn on DAT,By Dilanthi Jayamanne ,0,2024-01-23T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Health was forced to take a U-turn on its decision to halt the increased Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors, following a warning by the doctors that they would launch an indefinite strike if the allowance was not included in their January salaries.  On 23 January, the Director General of Health Services (DGHS), Dr. Asela Gunawardena, initially issued a circular to stop the DAT allowance for doctors. However, on the same day, in response to the doctors’ threat of an indefinite strike starting 24 January, Dr. Gunawardena took action to rescind the decision and reinstate the allowance. Doctors called for stern action against certain officials in the Treasury for having attempted to push the doctors into a continuous trade union action and against the Health and Finance Ministries for attempting to prevent the payment of the increased DAT allowance.     Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe, when contacted, said that the continuous strike scheduled to be launched from today (24) had been called off after the Health Ministry and the Ministry of Finance had reversed their earlier decision.  He said that the Finance and Health Ministries’ decision to refrain from adding the revised DAT allowance to the January 2024 salaries of medical practitioners had been reversed after Director General of Health Services, issued written notice to the Directors and Heads of all State Health Institutions, last evening cancelling with immediate effect a previously issued letter announcing that the payment of DAT for the month of January 2024 would be temporarily suspended. He said the Heads of Health Institutions were instructed to pay the relevant allowance through a special voucher to medical practitioners for the month of January, for those who do not receive the DAT allowance through the regular payroll.  Earlier in a turn of events following the spate of strikes launched by State health service employees, demanding the Rs 35,000 allowance, given as DAT to doctors last week, medical practitioners and dental surgeons declared war against the Ministries of Finance and Health for temporarily suspending the decision to pay the revised DAT allowance of a total Rs 70,000 to doctors.   GMOA Secretary, Dr. Haritha Aluthge warned that his outfit’s Executive Committee would launch a countrywide strike by 8 a.m. today (24) if steps were not taken to add the increased Rs 35,000 to the January 2024 wage of medical practitioners. He accused certain officials of the Ministries Health and Finance of conniving to deprive doctors of the DAT allowance.  The DAT was increased in accordance to a Cabinet paper submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe as Minister of Finance and was given the nod by the Cabinet of Ministers, he said.  Dr. Aluthge said the Rs 35,000 increment had been given to medical practitioners as a result of long-term agitations of the GMOA for ‘economic justice’ and fairness to the medical fraternity, the DAT allowance of the doctors was recently increased by Rs. 35,000.  Dr. Aluthge noted that the increment was given as a result of a Cabinet Paper submitted by the President as the as the Minister of Finance having recognised the need and priority to retain doctors in the country. Accordingly the Health Secretary issued a circular as the Chief Accounting Officer of the Health Ministry. The increased Rs 35,000 should be added to this month’s salary of the doctors. He said the hidden agenda, behind the effort to stop the payment of revised Rs 70,000 DAT payment to medical practitioners, based on verbal orders of some officials of the Ministry of Finance, despite the fact that the Treasury and the Ministry of Health have the necessary funds to pay this allowance to the doctors, should be revealed to the country. There are serious doubts regarding the fact that a conspiracy is being perpetrated to further weaken the health system, which has already faced a number of crises and create an unnecessary catastrophe in the country, he charged.  The Government Dental Surgeons’ Association (GDSA) warned that they too would resort to a strike from 8 a.m. today (24).  General Secretary, GDSA, Manjula Herath said the duration and specifics of the strike will be decided at an emergency executive committee meeting of the GDSA today (24). "

The group led by veteran politician R. Sampanthan, met India’s new High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Santosh Jha, on Monday, the source from the TNA, which represents Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority, said.  The two-hour talks centred on the 13A, which created the provincial council system for the island nation’s nine provinces. The Tamil parties pointed out the need for India’s intervention in the current Sri Lankan political context for the meaningful devolution of power, the source said. They also highlighted the issue of the Tamil political prisoners and the Tamil land grabbing by the State. India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13th Amendment brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987. The 13A provides for the devolution of power to the Tamil community. The 13A became a part of Sri Lanka’s Constitution in 1987 through the direct intervention of the then-Indian Government led by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi as part of the Indo-Lanka Accord. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has held talks with Tamil political parties for the implementation of 13A without the Police powers to the provinces. However, the proposal was shot down by various parties who have traditionally opposed any power-sharing proposals, claiming that the move could endanger the unitary state of Sri Lanka. Since the elimination of the LTTE, the moderate Tamil leaders have called for a solution to facilitate devolution within a united Sri Lanka. The LTTE, which fought for a ‘Tamil homeland’ for nearly 30 years, had rejected the 13A. They fought the Indian Army deployed as part of the Indo-Lanka Accord until they were fully withdrawn in 1990. The current Tamil political parties are sceptical of the political will of the majority Sinhala community to fully implement the 13A. The Tamils put forward their demand for autonomy since gaining independence from Britain in 1948, which, from the mid-70s, turned into a bloody armed conflict.

They have stated that as such, the Government is determined to illegally detain, all dissenting voices via the ratification of the ATB, by identifying them, as anti-government forces. The petitioners have pointed out to the Court, that though this particular Bill, had been tabled in the House last April or September, subject Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had withdrawn it, with the aim of tabling an amended Bill, due to vehement opposition, raised by the society against it, at the time. The petitions have stated, that though the Minister concerned, had promised Parliament, to amend the Bill and re-table it, Dr. Rajapakshe had reneged on his assurance and tabled the Bill, in its original form."

He observed that technology has created a much more globally connected world and transformed the ways in which international diplomacy can be conducted.  In light of this, and as part of Sri Lanka’s urgent need to modernise its governance structure, create efficiencies, and optimise limited resources, he is urging the Government to seriously consider drastically reducing the number of its Diplomatic Missions abroad. At present, Sri Lanka has over sixty, most of which are understaffed and under-resourced. In a telling contrast, Singapore, with foreign exchange reserves of close to USD 325 billion, has around fifty.  Moragoda observed that if a zero-based budgeting approach were taken, where the existence of every Mission has to be justified, Sri Lanka could easily reduce at least ten of its overseas Missions, and that part of this savings could be used to bolster the activities of the remaining Embassies and Consulates. He said the need for each Diplomatic representation and Embassy should be assessed dispassionately, taking into consideration functionality, affordability, and national interest.  The Government should then focus on empowering selected Missions that could overlook activities at a regional level and allocating extra resources to these, he added. He suggested that, as is the case with Singapore, some Ambassadors could be based at the Foreign Ministry with periodic visits to their countries of accreditation in keeping with a prearranged activity plan. He further observed that the ongoing budgetary crisis has provided a good opportunity to think afresh and rationalise and reevaluate institutions and policies founded under different historical and societal circumstances and that any system has to evolve and adapt to changing times."

The preliminary investigation indicated that a group of individuals in a green double cab committed the shooting. Information about a cab leaving the expressway exit led the Police to identify the suspected vehicle and its occupants. However, no direct connection was established between those in the cab and the incident so far. The investigation revealed that the suspects were possibly in a Pajero-type jeep, with two individuals using two weapons to carry out the shooting. A total of 36 empty shells of T56 firearms were found at the crime scene. Four victims died at the scene, while one was seriously injured and succumbed to injuries after being taken to the Tangalle Hospital, SSP Thalduwa said.  The victims, previously arrested as suspects in a murder case in Tangalle two years ago and subsequently released on bail, were on their way to the Tangalle court to testify in a related case when the shooting occurred. The Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) for the Southern Province has appointed six teams to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the incident. The bodies were taken to Tangalle Hospital for the post-mortem."

Utilising modern technology methods employed by Police traffic divisions in developed countries, including Europe, the Sri Lanka Police aim to enhance the efficiency of traffic duties. The introduction of CCTV surveillance is expected to reduce the physical duty of traffic Police officers in various locations throughout Colombo. The Ministry of Public Security acknowledged that despite the installation of CCTV camera systems in Colombo several decades ago, an effective service had not been achieved thus far. The announcement highlighted that while a traffic Police officer might physically observe five or six violations during an eight-hour shift, a CCTV camera installed at the same location could monitor more than three hundred violations.  This increased capability is attributed to the focused attention of Police officers on traffic management to alleviate congestion. The Ministry also revealed that the Motor Transport Commissioner’s Department is in direct collaboration with the Police Department to leverage CCTV technology. As a result, the Police CCTV Division will have swift access to legal registration, ownership information, and more for monitored vehicles through the Motor Transport Commissioner Department. Furthermore, the Minister stated that the Police CCTV Division will notify the owner of a traffic offense committed by a registered vehicle in an area outside of Colombo through the Police station of the relevant jurisdiction. To inform the public about this new process, a grace period will be provided in the first week, during which warning sheets will be issued for observed traffic offenses through the CCTV system. "

In a statement to ‘X,’ the minister conveyed that he has instructed the CEB management to promptly accept the resignation of any employee without hesitation. Additionally, the management has been directed to diligently recover all outstanding dues owed to the institution. Furthermore, officials within the CEB Management have received instructions to expedite the implementation of reforms within the institution. These reforms encompass mechanisms for cost reduction, the execution of identified power projects in the generation plan, the expansion of digital payment platforms and the outsourcing of payment collections, the minister explained. Minister Wijesekera also highlighted that directives have been issued to initiate disciplinary and legal action against personnel involved in disrupting CEB services during a token strike held in January of the current year. These new directives come in response to reports indicating that nearly 5,000 CEB employees are contemplating simultaneous resignations. According to the reports, the decision by the CEB Trade Union Alliance stems from perceived attempts by the ministry to suppress employees.  The Alliance reportedly took this decision following the interdiction of nearly 66 employees, who participated in a two-day strike from 3 January 2024, opposing the restructuring and privatisation of the CEB. "

Bail for the 61-year-old Dr. Perera was set at two sureties of one million rupees each. The doctor, who was detained under the protection of the Prisons Department officers, was brought to Court, along with two nurses and a doctor, in a Prisons Hospital ambulance. When the case was taken up, both parties informed the Chief Magistrate, that they were ready to settle the incident, amicably. Accordingly, Chief Magistrate Nettikumara, instructed all charges be submitted to the Mediation Board, other than the one linked to, hindering the performing of duty. The Court then advised the suspect oncologist, to refrain from illegally intervening in trade union action, resorted to by trade unionists, affiliated to the Hospital. The Chief Magistrate stated that he had been forced to incarcerate the oncologist, at the previous hearing, due to his decision to admit himself to Hospital, rather than being present in Court. He further added, that resorting to trade union action, is a right that has been guaranteed, to not only for doctors, but even to junior staffers of hospitals. He then insisted that therefore, doctors cannot be considered a different species before the law, as all are equal. The Galle Chief Magistrate explaining further, mentioned that though doctors and junior staff of hospitals, have the right to take trade union action, based on Provisions of the Trade Union Ordinance, they must always consider the consequences of their actions, on the public and ethics of the trade, before opting for such decisions. He then warned, that if either party, were to engage in trade union action in future, disregarding the orders issued by his Court, he will be compelled to institute stern action against them, irrespective of their status in society. Taking the submissions into perusal, Magistrate Nettikumara, released the suspect oncologist, on bail and advised the parties concerned, to be present in Court on 7 June, armed with the report, compiled by the Mediation Board. Dr. Perera was arrested on 18 January.  The three minor staff members who were arrested on 21 January, in connection with a complaint, by Dr. Perera, alleging assault, were further remanded, until 29 January. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

These traders also added that among other reaasons for the price of chillies to have spiked had been the constant rains which had been experienced during the past few months, causing damage to the cultivations and farmers opting out of the business etc. The wholesale price of a kilo of chillies had been between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,200 in early January.

At this conference, ten proposals were presented and adapted. They include the call for reducing of increased water and electricity bills, exempting the money received at the time of retirement from taxes, providing a salary suitable for the economy to the estate workers, and confirming the rights of women under the labour law. Speaking on this occasion the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the federation stated: “Contradictions are emerging between employers and working people. The Government should not clash with the trade unions. They should identify the problems and deal with them effectively. It was proposed at this conference that a tripartite conference is required to find solutions, for these issues, by consensus. “Sectors that contribute less to the national economy get more privileges. We need to direct our working people towards the sectors that generate a higher income. The main issue faced by the working people is the increasing cost of living. Daily income begins to drop due to this issue. There is no need for politicians and trade unions to clash over this. There should be a mutual trust between politicians and trade unions to solve these problems and the ability to create innovative ways to solve them. Many problems can be solved by working together democratically. “During the periods when the private sector was very powerful, the working people had no protection. If they asked for a higher salary or stopped working till night, employers sacked them. It was possible to change that situation because the working people got together and made trade union as a centre to take measures to win those basic rights. “In order to secure the labour law in Sri Lanka, our trade union started a series of discussions with other trade unions to make amendments suitable to the current situation. The Ceylon Socialist Labour Federation helped to change certain chapters completely. Because of that, we were able to become a strong trade union movement. “We cannot expect the development of the country as well as the institutional development from the board of directors alone. I strongly emphasise that we can’t keep full faith in the board of directors. Accordingly, new steps should be taken to achieve the protection of the rights of these institutions and employees under tripartite agreements. Trade unions are the backbone of the country. Rather than being individual, the people who work together and organisse themselves as trade unions can make a huge contribution to their rights as well as the development of their company and the development of the country.”  Vice President of the M.E.P, State Minister Sisira Jayakodi said: “We have been mourning for seventy-five years. But they do not talk about the condition of this country before independence. Labourers had no rights at that time. In such an era Philip Gunawardena, the main leftist leader and others started the anti -imperialist movement and contributed to the freedom struggle. “We extend best wishes to the President of our Federation, on his appointment as Prime Minister. Leadership and the struggle he made on behalf of the rights of farmers, labourers, educated generation and suffering people of this country for a long time within the parliament and outside, is a great strength for our Ceylon Socialist Labour Union Federation.” Deputy Secretary of the MEP, Member of Parliament Yadamini Gunawardena said: “This trade union movement is not a gift placed on a golden platter. Fifty years ago, these senior brothers and sisters started this movement with the leader during a very difficult period. Dinesh Gunawardena took the leadership of a political party, without even a parliamentary representation, with the objective of creating the future for the country for the betterment of working people together with young leaders like you. He took the leadership of the Ceylon Socialist Labour Union on behalf of all the people by protecting the unitary State for the working people. It is not necessary to remind you that the only trade union movement that has won victories for the working people of the country for 50 consecutive years is the Ceylon Socialist Labour Union. We have to face an even more challenging period in the future. I would like to remind you that the future is a period in which we need to take the achievements further. “ On this occasion, tributes were also paid to the founding members of the Ceylon Socialist Labour Union. Greetings from fellow trade unions, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Member of Parliament Gamini Lokage, President of Public Service United Trade Union Federation, W.A.

Perera,0,2024-01-22T20:32:00+00:00,"Private bus trade unions expressed their displeasure over the newly implemented CCTV system, set up by the Sri Lanka Police, to identify traffic violations.  Addressing a media briefing yesterday (22) Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) Secretary Anjana Priyanjith said the Government should create smart roads before creating a smart driver. Addressing concerns around the latest initiative of the Police, to trace traffic offenders in Colombo using CCTV cameras, effective from yesterday (22), Priyanjith alleged that the Government and the Police are trying to implement such concept because the Government is trying to run the country on taxes and fines.  Questioning the actions of Police, Priyanjith said that they should reveal whether a higher number of fatal accidents occur within the city of Colombo or in other areas. He claimed that bus drivers and conductors have been involved in minor fatal accidents in the city of Colombo, while children of politicians, VIPs are responsible for most of the fatal accidents within the Colombo city limit – which had already resulted in multiple deaths of traffic Police officers on duty. He further asked the Police to address the issue of State and private vehicles parking on the side of the road obstructing traffic and to relaunch the bus priority lane concept, which Priyanjith claimed to have allowed bus drivers to provide an impeccable service, but is now defunct. He also said that once the programme is initiated and fine sheets start arriving at the homes of bus owners, suspected for violating traffic rules, there will be no buses for people to report for their duties on time from today onwards. He further said that the bus owners’ priority has always been to transport people to and from their work place and homes safely and punctually. Meanwhile, Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association (LPBOA) Chairman, Gemunu Wijeratne, who also expressed displeasure over the CCTV system, said before taking such steps the government should have held discussions with them. "

Of the cases Disgnosed from Batticaloa 23 were children, 45 of the cases identified from Colombo were children while Kalutara had 16 child leprosy cases that year, from the number diagnosed in the district.     Dr. Kahawita lamented that 10% of the cases diagnosed annually were children below the age of 14 years. The campaign aims to eliminate leprosy and in order to do so the number of child leprosy cases should be brought under control. Although the 75% of the children have the non-infectious variety of leprosy, it is obvious that these children contract the infection caused by the slow-growing Mycobacterium leprae from adults. When only four per cent of the children in the rest of the globe have leprosy, 10 Sri Lankan children below the age of 14 have the disease.  The Consultant Dermatologist noted that the ALC’s Leprosy Initiative for Elimination hoped to ensure that in order to eliminate leprosy from among children is to ensure that there are no adults with leprosy in families with children.     "

In recent years, foreigners who used to frequent beachfront locations have shifted their preferences to entering villages and towns in these areas, opting to rent houses for extended periods, they alleged.  This shift has adversely affected businesses in beachfront locations, causing a significant impact on the livelihoods of those dependent on the tourism sector. Industry representatives are calling on authorities to intervene, either by providing relief measures or implementing strategies to rekindle tourist interest in the beachfront areas. They emphasised the urgent need for support to revitalise the tourism industry in these once-thriving locations."

In response to these appeals, the Department of Agrarian Development has earmarked Rs 500 million from the allocated budget for small and medium-scale irrigation reconstruction works to facilitate the swift restoration of the damaged canals. Farmers, who heavily depend on these water canals for their agricultural activities, have expressed their gratitude for the proactive steps taken by the Minister and the Department of Agrarian Development.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/22/veggie-prices-take-a-tumble/,Veggie prices take a tumble,BY Neeta Pathmakumari – Norwood,0,2024-01-21T20:36:00+00:00,"In a remarkable development, vegetable prices have witnessed a noteworthy decline of 40 to 54 per cent within a space of five days, as consumers have refused to buy vegetables, due to sky-rocketing prices and have opted to buy fish and meat instead.  According to Chairman of the Nuwara Eliya Dedicated Economic Centre Aruna Shantha Hettiarachchi, the demand for the vegetable was significantly reduced as the price of fish at the Peliyagoda Fish Market has dropped.  “As a result of the astonishing price increase in vegetables, customers shifted their dietary preferences to fish. Because of that, the prices of vegetables had to be reduced. Otherwise, huge vegetable stocks will go to waste,” he said, addressing the media yesterday (21).  Hettiarachchi explained that the decrease in vegetable prices is a strategic measure to minimise waste. As of yesterday (21), the wholesale prices of vegetables in the Nuwara Eliya region, as provided by Hettiarachchi, are as follows: Cabbage was priced between Rs 450 and 470 per kg, carrots ranged from Rs 900 to 950, leeks priced between Rs 340 and 360, beetroot between Rs 400 and 420, cut beetroot priced between Rs 500 and 520 and potatoes were available in the range of Rs 300 to 320. Hettiarachchi dismissed claims that the price increase was due to the businesspersons, who own vegetable farms, increasing the prices according to their will, asserting that the pricing was determined through a systematic process within the economic centre without the involvement of any mafia. Hettiarachchi expressed solidarity with farmers and emphasised the importance of protecting their interests. He credited Minister Mahinda Amaraweera for his commitment to the agricultural sector, urging him to ensure proper execution of agricultural initiatives. Furthermore, Hettiarachchi stressed the need for training Nuwara Eliya farmers in foreign agricultural technologies, to enhance competitiveness and foster economic growth in the farming sector. Wholesale vegetable prices reached unprecedented levels last week, notably with a kg of carrots retailing between Rs 2,000 – 2,200.  The cost of broccoli too was skyrocketed to a staggering Rs 7,000. Leeks and beetroot were reportedly sold at Rs 500, while a kg of beans commanded a price of Rs 800. The market also observed the sale of a kg of green chillies at Rs 1,600, with vendors noting that a kg of radish was priced at Rs 350. Remarkably, in December, carrots were available at prices ranging from Rs 350 to Rs 400 per kg while broccoli was sold at Rs 750. In this backdrop, owners of restaurants and wayside boutiques, in and around Nuwara Eliya, said they were facing the challenge of preparing food items, such as sambar curry, kottu and fried rice with minimal quantities of carrot and other upcountry vegetables, or even without them entirely, due to the unexpected high prices of such vegetables."

Sri Lanka initiated egg imports in the first half of 2023 amid a severe shortage and in response to the surging prices of eggs within the local market.

Damiano Francovigh, the Ambassador of Italy to Sri Lanka, underscored the significance of the Green Transition Roadmap and its pivotal role in propelling the Trincomalee Net-Zero Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and the Italy-Sri Lanka Green Corridor. Vittorio Coco, President of CIBEA, unveiled a strategic vision that outlined a comprehensive three-phased approach. The roadmap’s blueprint entails: Phase 1: Building a Solar-Powered Foundation This phase prioritises the establishment of a large-scale solar PV plant within the SEZ, optimising grid integration, and electrifying all facilities with sustainable alternatives. Phase 2: Embracing the Potential of Hydrogen Focused on exploring hydrogen production feasibility within the SEZ, this phase aims to develop a dedicated hydrogen infrastructure network and implement pilot projects showcasing hydrogen utilisation across diverse sectors. Phase 3: Exploring the Green Fuel Landscape This phase emphasises continuous research on emerging green fuel technologies beyond hydrogen, maintaining flexibility to adapt to advancements and market demands. The approach also fosters robust partnerships for knowledge sharing and joint development efforts. Key considerations for successful implementation include supportive policies and regulations, innovative financing mechanisms, and capacity building through training programmes. The strategic collaboration between Sri Lanka and Italy leverages the unique strengths of each nation, combining Sri Lanka’s abundant sunshine and strategic location with Italy’s advanced renewable energy technologies and expertise in port management. Support for the initiative extended to Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva, who expressed live and recorded salutations to the project.

Although his SLMC registration was revoked in January last year and it was supposed to conclude in August, the SLMC had not taken steps to re-register him due to him practising medicine during the suspension period.  However, the reports also indicate that the SLMC is considering suspending his registration for an additional eight months.  However, the Ministry of Health has paid Dr. Haq’s salary, including all allowances, except overtime, from January last year up to now.  In response to this situation, Dr. Darshana Sirisena, President of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) criticised this action saying that it was a very wrong decision taken by the Ministry of Health.  Dr. Sirisena emphasised that salaries should not be paid when a doctor losses his SLMC registration.  The GMOA President also said they got to know about this situation when Dr. Haq applied for the Chief JMO post in Colombo which is vacant at the moment.  The Ministry of Health placed Dr. Haq on compulsory leave last August. This decision was implemented starting 17 August, following the recommendations of the Public Services Commission.  Dr. Haq, despite facing suspension from the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), conducted post-mortems on the late businessman Dinesh Schaffter, whose murder remains unsolved and the child who passed away after a kidney surgery at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) for Children in Colombo. The SLMC imposed an eight-month suspension on Dr. Ruhul Haq (SLMC Registration 15168) from 20 December 2022, following an inquiry into a complaint lodged by one S.A. Rathnasena."

President Wickremesinghe is participating in the 19th NAM Summit at the invitation of President Yoweri Museveni, of the Republic of Uganda. The Summit was convened on the theme ‘Deepening Cooperation for Shared Global Affluence’ and was preceded by the Ministerial Meeting led by Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, and the Senior Officials meeting led by Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane. The President welcomed that the 19th Summit has given the highest priority to the crisis in Gaza and the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine to self-determination and the realisation of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine. Highlighting contemporary global challenges, President Wickremesinghe noted the need for a strong and united NAM that plays a vital role as geostrategic rivalries in political, economic, technological and military terms become more pronounced among former and new contenders for major power status. He proposed that NAM, while upholding the Bandung Principles in the evolving multipolar world, needs to oppose the spread of big power rivalry including the coercion of uncommitted States and to build a multipolar world which incorporates the political, economic, social and climate change mitigation aspirations of the Global South. He further noted that the NAM membership today is no longer a grouping of weak States and that it must recognise that as a result of the rapid progress and economic advancement of some Asian, African and Latin American States a majority of the 10 leading economies of 2050 will belong to the NAM. On the sidelines of the Kampala Summit, President Wickremesinghe is scheduled to hold bilateral discussions with the President of South Africa, Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Prime Minister of Nepal, Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Prime Minister of Tanzania and the Vice President of Benin. The NAM, which currently consists of 123 Member States is based on the Bandung Principles and aims to advance the interests of developing countries.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry PC highlighted the importance of these engagements, emphasising the sizable population of approximately 1.3 billion in these African countries and the anticipated rapid development in the future. In his statement on Saturday (20), Minister Ali Sabry pointed out that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s ‘Look Africa’ initiative has laid the groundwork for Sri Lanka to invest in African nations, marking the commencement of a new economic journey for the country. In a special statement on the official visit to Uganda, where President Wickremesinghe participated in the 19th Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement and the G77+China Summit, Minister Ali Sabry reiterated the significance of broadening Sri Lanka’s engagement with Africa. “Addressing the Non-Aligned Nations Conference yesterday, President Ranil Wickremesinghe touched upon global issues, particularly focusing on events in the Gaza Strip, Israel-Palestine, the future steps for developing countries, and strategies for alleviating the burden of debt and addressing climate change. The President shared his perspectives on a range of topics. Foreign leaders and ministers I engaged with expressed their commendation for President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s insightful speech. Simultaneously, the President engaged in discussions with several leaders from the Global South, specifically in the African region.  Notable meetings included talks with the President of Uganda, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, the Vice President of the Republic of Benin, the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of India. The discussions centred on enhancing bilateral relations between these nations and Sri Lanka. I am optimistic that this visit will fortify relations with African countries that are often overlooked, despite their substantial population of 1.3 billion, and are projected to undergo rapid development in the future. The economic progress witnessed in Sri Lanka under President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s leadership, along with the President’s pivotal role, garnered appreciation from all counterparts. Reflecting on the past year and a half since President Wickremesinghe assumed office, there has been widespread acclaim for the notable advancements Sri Lanka has achieved. Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni specifically lauded President Ranil Wickremesinghe for contributing to the reconstruction of the nation. Additionally, the Non-Aligned Nations Summits provided a platform to present the current situation in Sri Lanka to the international community. This visit by the President has played a crucial role in fostering bilateral relations with numerous countries in the African region.  Furthermore, it’s noteworthy that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s ‘Look Africa’ initiative has laid the groundwork for investing in African countries, marking the commencement of a new economic chapter for Sri Lanka. A notable example is the arrangement with the Republic of Benin, wherein mutual benefits are expected through the visa exemption for holders of diplomatic, official, and service passports from both countries. As the Foreign Minister, I seized the opportunity to engage in bilateral discussions with counterparts from Bangladesh, Bahrain, Ghana, Tanzania, Azerbaijan, and others. These dialogues have been instrumental in strengthening friendships and fostering economic ties with these nations. Hence, through participation in such summits, our country aspires to further enhance bilateral relations with international partners and reap substantial benefits for the nation.”"

Ambassador Aryasinha said the event underscored the pivotal role of ‘cultural diplomacy’ in positioning Sri Lanka globally and heightened the importance of acknowledging cultural diversity and leveraging it to promote tourism in Sri Lanka. He said it was a potent force which transcends borders and fosters mutual understanding in a world which is marked by interconnectedness and interdependence. He recalled the writings of Ambassador Dr. Vernon L.B. Mendis where it was observed “Few countries in the world could claim to have been so well known throughout its history as Sri Lanka. From earliest times to modern times, it has enjoyed an international reputation and been admired.”  Professor Asanga Tilakaratne, Emeritus Professor of Pali and Buddhist Studies, University of Colombo, who participated in the discussion virtually under the theme ‘Journey Through Antiquity’, painted a vivid picture of ancient Serendib from the Roman times and how the island nation emerged as a significant entity in the annals of world history. He highlighted writings on relations with India, South East Asia and East Asia in which Sri Lanka was the destination – commencing with the Ramayana, through the arrival of Prince Vijaya, the introduction of Buddhism through Arahant Mahinda and Sanghamitta Theri with the SriMaha Bodhi sapling. Referring to the fifth century relations with East Asia particularly with China, he noted Fa Hsien being the first known Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, the Polonnaruva period which saw Hindu influence on the island’s culture, art, architecture, while relations particularly with what is today Myanmar and Thailand, was a significant factor starting from around the 11th century continuing till the 15th century. Renowned Sri Lankan author and novelist Ameena Hussein, who also participated in the discussion virtually, highlighted the documented history of the island by Arab travellers and took the audience on a historical journey with her discourse centered on her recent book ‘Visitors from the Arab World: Ibn Battuta in Sri Lanka’. She expounded upon his role, emphasising the pivotal contribution he made to the historical chronicles of Sri Lanka, thereby underscoring his enduring impact on the island’s historical narrative. Professor Shihan de Silva Jayasuriya commenced the discussion with an exploration of; ‘Untold Stories: Colonial Travellers and Minority Groups’.  With a focus on ancient Ceylon during the Colonial era, she illuminated how Sri Lanka assimilated cultural elements influenced by the Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonial powers, shaping its distinctive identity.  Professor Ruvani Ranasinha, Professor of Global Literature, King’s College, University of London speaking on the theme ‘Sri Lanka as a Destination: Modern Day Framings’ explored how Sri Lanka is portrayed in contemporary literature."

The accused were allegedly involved in trafficking of 39 Sri Lankan nationalists to Mangaluru via Tamil Nadu by falsely promising them that they were being taken to Canada. The victims were confined in various lodges across Mangaluru and were initially arrested by Karnataka Police, as accomplices along with the accused persons, NIA said in a press release. NIA had launched investigations after taking over the case on 13 July, 2021, and found 39 to be the victims of a human trafficking racket. The agency had filed the original chargesheet in the case on 5 October, 2021, against six accused persons who were involved in the trafficking, while the victims were freed and sent back home, NIA claimed. NIA investigations revealed that Mohammed Imran Khan, in conspiracy with Pudhumadam Imran and his friends Seeni Aabul Khan and Mohamed Ibrahim, received the Sri Lankan nationals in mid-sea, and brought them to Bengaluru and further to Mangaluru. NIA said that further investigations showed that the entire initial conspiracy was planned by Pudumadam Imran along with one Eesan, a Sri Lankan national, who is one of the absconding accused in the case.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/22/mylathamadu-issue-has-to-be-resolved/,Mylathamadu issue has to be resolved,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan ,0,2024-01-21T20:31:00+00:00,"Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK)  Batticaloa MP Shanakkiyan, speaking  on the grievances of the livestock farmers in Mylathamadu, in the Eastern Province, said  over the past 17 years, the majority community has taken deliberate steps to alter the ethnic composition of the North and East and the number of Sinhalese in the East has increased by a staggering 800%.  In contrast, in districts like Gampaha, Colombo, Galle and Kandy, the growth of the Sinhala population is only 200%, which he said, indicates a deliberate effort to artificially resettle people to change the demographic landscape. In the Ampara District, there has been a remarkable 1,200% growth in Sinhala settlements.  In an interview with Ceylon Today, he said, “When the Mahaweli Development Act was enacted, it was intended that lands would be allocated based on the national ethnic composition ratio. However, to date, Mahaweli water has not reached Batticaloa or the North; it has only reached Anuradhapura recently. Within the Mahaweli project, 96% of the lands given so far have gone to the Sinhala people. This contradicts the national ethnic ratio, where 24% of the land should be allocated to Tamils, Muslims and the Tamils of the Upcountry. The Government is not implementing its own law, neglecting the call for ethnic balance.” The Mylathamadu region, another Mahaweli settlement, is being opened up for Sinhalese settlers. An issue has arisen around a village called Divulapathana, which existed in the Ampara District before the war. In the 60s and 70s, around 40 Sinhala families lived there, but they were displaced due to the conflict. In 2010, they returned to an overgrown forest area. The pastureland for cattle remains surrounded by forest in patches, he said. He also pointed out that former Eastern Province Governor Anuradha Yahampath advocated for people to settle illegally, aiming to change the ethnic composition. Displaced individuals are opposing the new settlers Yahampath sent. The Government turned a blind eye, allowing the issue to escalate into a dispute between Tamils and Sinhalese, involving monks and potentially creating ethnic tension island-wide. This contested area spans 42 km along the main road and covers 20,000 hectares of land. During the monsoon season, cattle are taken to pastureland, which is not officially gazetted. After the harvest, the cattle return to paddy land, and haphazard cultivation by resettlers is encroaching their routes, leading to conflicts. This has resulted in the killing of 200 or more cattle by settlers, causing significant hardship to livestock farmers. The suggested solution is to gazette some land as pastureland and allocate specific areas for Sinhala settlers. He said there is no issue in Sinhalese buying land and settling anywhere in the country.  The Tamil community residing island-wide, particularly in the North and East, decided to live in Colombo and they buy land and houses and the settling of Tamils in Colombo is not orchestrated by the Government; thus, anyone is free to live anywhere in the country.  “Our stance does not oppose Sinhala people settling in the North and East; they also can buy land and houses or agricultural plots. However, our concern lies in the Government’s actions of bringing 500 people illegally and compelling them to settle in Batticaloa. An example of this manipulation is evident in the redrawing of electoral boundaries in the Ampara District. Until 1989, only one Sinhala MP was elected, but the annexation of Padiyathalawa and Dehiattakandiya to Batticaloa resulted in an increase of Sinhala representation to three MPs. This alteration, done artificially, distorts the democratic process. In the 2020 election, no Tamil candidate was elected from Ampara."

This concerning information was unveiled through a special project conducted by the Police Children and Women Bureau, the Acting IGP said.  Addressing the media, at the Ministry of Public Security, Tennakoon emphasised the importance of children and women feeling empowered to report such incidents without hesitation, so that special investigations could be initiated. Speaking further, the Acting IGP noted that a group of individuals, even within prominent professions in the country, is actively promoting the distribution of explicit content involving underage children.  Legal actions will be taken against those responsible for disseminating such videos on social media platforms, he added.  Child pornography, as defined by the United States Department of Justice (2020), is considered a form of child sexual exploitation. It encompasses any visual representation depicting sexually explicit conduct involving a minor, defined as individuals less than 18 years old. Additionally, these explicit images of minors are often referred to as child sexual abuse images. Article 27 (13) of Chapter VI in the Constitution of Sri Lanka stipulates that the State is obligated to carefully promote the interests of children and youth, ensuring their comprehensive development – encompassing physical, mental, moral, religious, and social aspects – while also safeguarding them from exploitation and discrimination.  Despite the existence of laws related to pornography, such as the Obscene Publications Ordinance No. 4 of 1927, the Vagrants Ordinance No. 4 of 1841 and the Penal Code, they lack explicit definitions regarding child pornography. In response to this gap, the Penal Code Section 286A has been introduced to address the issue of ‘obscene publication and exhibition relating to children’ below the age of 18. Furthermore, Section 286C has been incorporated to criminalise the storage or distribution of child pornography via email and the Internet. The Ministry of Public Security introduced a new hotline to report crimes against women and children in Sri Lanka.

Additionally, this specific specialist faces allegations of assaulting a female medical officer at Teaching Hospital Karapitiya when she was pregnant a few years ago. According to the hospital sources, the senior Oncologist concerned had been under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. Hospital staff had withdrawn from services demanding his immediate arrest for attacking a junior staff member.   The Police Media Unit noted that the Senior Oncologist had been arrested by Galle Police, while he had been receiving treatment at Private Hospital for an alleged heart condition.  They said he was currently being treated under Police custody.  The Senior Oncologist had allegedly assaulted the staff member during a heated argument between him and other hospital staff over the disrupting of hospital services with their token strike. The Health Assistant had later been admitted to the Teaching Hospital itself. When the case was called before the Galle Chief Magistrate, the specialist doctor was conspicuously absent. Upon the Magistrate’s inquiry, directed at the accused lawyers, they explained that the accused had been hospitalised due to a heart attack following an alleged altercation on Wednesday night (17), instigated by a group of about a dozen people who visited his house. At this point, the lawyers representing the aggrieved party countered, asserting that the doctor had verbally abused employees reporting for work the next day and later returned in the evening to abuse them in obscene language. After considering these details, the Magistrate granted two hours to the Police to provide reasons for the suspect’s non-appearance in Court and instructed them to obtain and produce the relevant medical reports from the hospital. However, the magistrate warned that if it was discovered that the suspect was deliberately avoiding the Court, he would be remanded. Following this, the Police promptly visited the private hospital, where the doctor was admitted and brought a medical report issued by the cardiologist, Dr. Sadananda. Despite this report, upon examination, the magistrate expressed a desire to visit the hospital to personally assess the suspect’s condition. The magistrate suggested that the lawyers could accompany him, and after the Court proceedings, they all went to the private hospital in Karapitiya where the suspect was being held and ordered his remand. Meanwhile, in a letter to the Director of Teaching Hospital, Karapitiya, the Secretary of the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS), Karapitiya, Dr. Krishantha Jayasekera has called for an impartial inquiry into the alleged incident, in order to restore normal services of the institution at the earliest. “The normal practice island-wide has been to maintain cancer-related clinical work during the trade union action by all health staff,” he pointed out noting that during Tuesday’s (16) trade union action work at the Onco Surgical Unit had been disrupted compromising surgeries.  Dr. Jayasekera said, Senior Consultant Oncological Surgeon, Dr. S.C.R. Perera, had duly written a complaint and raised his concern regarding disruption of cancer surgery. He claimed that Dr. S.C.R. Perera proceeded to the Director’s Office on the following day (17) “while there had been life threatening mob attack on him by some categories of employees.” The AMS Karapitiya Branch Secretary alleged that the continuous harassment of a senior colleague in different forms was impeding his work and the provision of cancer care at the hospital. However, informed health sources revealed that the said Oncologist concerned had other allegations of assault levelled against him. They alleged that on an earlier occasion he had been also accused of assaulting a pregnant medical practitioner working with him at the hospital. "

Chaired by Dr. Harsha de Silva, the Committee sought information on the progress of tax collection from the implicated companies and directed the Inland Revenue Department to submit a comprehensive report within one week, according to the Communications Department of Parliament. During a recent meeting, the Committee underscored its disappointment with the lack of action taken by the relevant authorities, despite a 99.5% reduction in the Special Commodity Levy on sugar imports, as specified in Gazette 2197/12 dated 13 October 2020. The Committee emphasised the absence of accountability measures, allowing certain large corporations to unjustly benefit from the reduced tax rate at the expense of consumers. In addition, the Committee expressed concern about the proposed reversal of the tax policy, intending to raise the Special Commodity Levy on sugar from Rs 0.25 per Kg back to Rs 50 per Kg. The Ministry of Finance’s plan to collect Rs 30 billion from the average Sri Lankan, while permitting implicated corporations to evade responsibility, faced strong criticism. The Committee stressed the importance of holding wrongdoers accountable before imposing additional financial burdens on the public."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/19/crime-rate-down-17-due-to-yukthiya-minister-alles/,Crime rate down 17% due to ‘Yukthiya’– Minister Alles,BY Mithun Jayawardhana,0,2024-01-18T20:32:00+00:00,"The country’s crime rate had shrunk by 17 per cent during the past one-month or so and this has been due to the ongoing ‘Yukthiya’ anti-narcotic operation, initiated by the Sri Lanka Police, Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles said.  He added that similarly all acts of crime and other related acts had declined markedly throughout the country due to the Yukthiya operation. Minister Alles remarked that he has no intention of scuttling the ongoing operations midway due to pressure or influence exerted on him and was adamant that the exercise will be continued unabated to rid the society of the illegal drug trade and the underworld network. He stated that though some had lambasted the operations as a mere media show, all established and recognised media outlets had blessed it and insisted that a small group, surviving via the illegal drug business, were making such baseless allegations. Minister Alles maintained that his ministry was receiving a sizeable number of phone calls daily from the public commending the initiative undertaken by him to once and for all dispense with the aforesaid twin scourges from the society and noted that this alone indicated as to how much the masses had suffered from the ravages of the illegal drug trade and the underworld. The Minister also said that certain influential and well-known people were unfairly criticising the operations but warned that before long he would disclose their identities to the country. He made these comments during a media conference, held at his Ministry yesterday, to review the progress of the Yukthiya operation and the activities rendered by his Ministry during the past year. The Public Security Minister added that if someone were to put a spoke in the wheel of the Yukthiya exercise, he will not think twice before resigning from his office and stressed that Ministerial posts or privileges were not his motivation and that it holds no interest for him. Responding to a question on whether the incident that occurred in Weligama recently was legal, Alles opined that no illegal act had taken place during the initiative. He explained that such spurious allegations had been made due to a personal issue between him and the hotel owner in question and pointed out that the people should not believe lies which are spread claimed to be the gospel truth. He stated that suspects had been nabbed, after the said hotel had been raided, for supplying illegal drugs 15 times previously and observed that a dedicated officer from the Police Department had met with the unfortunate fate after he had gone there on an inspection visit. The Minister was also of the view that if certain officers from the Police Department had acted diligently on intelligence reports they could have prevented the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks. Minister Alles noted that as he had analysed the Easter Sunday carnage even before its lead up and in its aftermath, he was firmly of the opinion that it was an attack the country could have well averted if action had been taken beforehand. He remarked that as such, the ringleader behind the carnage Zahran Hashim, too, could have been apprehended before the bombs were exploded five years ago, if the Police Department had paid due heed to intelligence reports of the imminent attack. He therefore accepted the fact that the Police Department had been guilty of dereliction of its duty regards the Easter Sunday blasts. The Public Security Minister also added that new places where passports could be obtained will be increased up to 335. According to him, 53 such centres had been operated here previously and they were presently functioning smoothly.   "

Chaired by Dr. Harsha de Silva, the Committee sought information on the progress of tax collection from the implicated companies and directed the Inland Revenue Department to submit a comprehensive report within one week, according to the Communications Department of Parliament. During a recent meeting, the Committee underscored its disappointment with the lack of action taken by the relevant authorities, despite a 99.5% reduction in the Special Commodity Levy on sugar imports, as specified in Gazette 2197/12 dated 13 October 2020. The Committee emphasised the absence of accountability measures, allowing certain large corporations to unjustly benefit from the reduced tax rate at the expense of consumers. In addition, the Committee expressed concern about the proposed reversal of the tax policy, intending to raise the Special Commodity Levy on sugar from Rs 0.25 per Kg back to Rs 50 per Kg. The Ministry of Finance’s plan to collect Rs 30 billion from the average Sri Lankan, while permitting implicated corporations to evade responsibility, faced strong criticism. The Committee stressed the importance of holding wrongdoers accountable before imposing additional financial burdens on the public."

The accused, identified as K. K. Mahinda Premalal, who had been charged with the murder of C.

Attorney-at-Law Pradeep Jayakody, appearing for the accused, while cross examining the then RFP, R. A.

This represents a significant 30 per cent of the total State expenditure for education. Speaking at a meeting in Dehiowita on Tuesday (16), Siyambalapitiya highlighted the essential role tuition has assumed in the country’s economic landscape. He emphasised that on average, a child spends Rs 20,000 monthly on tuition and with approximately 5.7 million families in the country, parents collectively contribute around Rs 121 to Rs 122 billion for tuition. Reflecting on the evolution of economic indicators since 1952, Siyambalapitiya emphasised the transformative significance of tuition expenses today.  “This is the significant impact of the competitive education system on parents. They are compelled to allocate 30 per cent of their expenditure on tuition, an amount comparable to the Government’s investment in school education. In comparison, the Government has allocated Rs 546 billion for 2024 from the Treasury, with Rs 402 billion designated for total education expenditure, including school education. These figures do not encompass people’s expenses, prompting the appointment of a team to investigate rising inflation in the country,” Siyambalapitiya said. "

The Mahanayaka Thera commended the initiatives taken by Alles to wipe out the twin scourges of the illegal drug trade and its offshoot the underworld and advised him to proceed forth without bowing down to anyone. Afterwards, the Minister aired his view to the media and stressed that the Yukthiya operation has not been launched to seek political revenge from anyone but that its aim is to ensure the rights and safety of citizens whilst upholding the rule of law. He warned that he will not be forced into halting the said drive midway through despite whatever pressure is exerted on him as he has the backing of the President and the blessings of the Mahanayaka Theras. He also added that all illegal drug traffickers functioning hitherto from abroad will be extradited to the country via the help of Interpol as part of the Yukthiya operation."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/18/hrcsl-puts-forth-five-key-recommendations/,HRCSL puts forth five key recommendations,BY Methmalie Dissanayake,0,2024-01-17T20:32:00+00:00,"The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has put forth five pivotal recommendations regarding the Bill on the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka, officially gazetted on 29 December 2023. In a communication addressed to the President, the HRCSL acknowledged the internationally recognised human right to truth, underscoring its essential role in the realm of transitional justice.  However, it emphasised that the promotion of this right should be synchronised with the advancement of other key transitional justice pillars, including accountability, reparations and preventing the recurrence of historical injustices. To address these concerns, the HRCSL has put forth five key recommendations. Firstly, an urgent call for the establishment of a high-level committee under the Presidential Secretariat is proposed. This committee would comprise relevant experts and representatives from victim groups and civil society. Its primary mandate is to oversee the implementation of all positive recommendations arising from previous truth-seeking mechanisms, such as the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC). Secondly, the HRCSL advocates for the implementation of nationwide programs aimed at disseminating information about the findings of past truth-seeking mechanisms to the entire country. Thirdly, the commission recommends the formation of a robust, impartial entity dedicated to investigating and prosecuting serious human rights violations and crimes. This entity should be promptly equipped with essential resources and granted access to expertise, including international perspectives as required. Furthermore, the HRCSL emphasises the importance of ensuring that transitional justice in Sri Lanka comprehensively addresses both armed conflicts and civil disturbances, including insurrections. This approach involves delving into the political and socioeconomic roots of these events for a holistic national reckoning. Lastly, the HRCSL suggests designating the Presidential Secretariat as the host for any transitional justice mechanism in Sri Lanka."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/18/sri-lanka-maldives-control-hepatitis-b/,"Sri Lanka, Maldives control hepatitis B",Author not found,0,2024-01-17T20:32:00+00:00,"Sri Lanka and the Maldives have successfully achieved control over hepatitis B, according to an announcement from the World Health Organisation on Wednesday (17).  The achievement was verified by an expert panel, which confirmed that both countries have consistently maintained high coverage of hepatitis B vaccine doses for infants, coupled with a low prevalence of the disease. Recent serological surveys conducted in both nations further corroborated this positive outcome. Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director of WHO South-East Asia, extended congratulations and commendation to Maldives and Sri Lanka for their noteworthy accomplishment. She emphasised the dedicated efforts of health leaders, officials, health workers, and the citizens of these countries towards the health and well-being of their communities. The Expert Panel for Verification of Hepatitis B Control in the WHO South-East Asia Region reviewed childhood immunisation data from both countries, revealing consistent coverage of over 90% with hepatitis B vaccine doses administered during infancy for several years. The panel also considered the findings of national surveys conducted among children in 2022-2023. Based on the evidence presented, the Expert Panel concluded that the standards required for the verification of hepatitis B control have been met in both Maldives and Sri Lanka. Dr. Supamit Chunsuttiwat, chairperson of the Regional Expert Panel, recommended that these countries have successfully achieved this important public health target. With this achievement, Sri Lanka and the Maldives join Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Thailand, which accomplished the same feat in 2019. Preventing hepatitis B infection in infancy significantly reduces chronic infections, liver cancer, and cirrhosis in adulthood. Hepatitis control remains a crucial public health initiative in the South-East Asia Region, home to a quarter of the world’s population. The region has an estimated 60 million people living with chronic hepatitis B, with 218,000 deaths occurring annually due to hepatitis B and C. The goal is to reduce hepatitis B prevalence to less than 1% among children aged at least 5 years. The hepatitis B vaccine, part of the pentavalent vaccine, is included in the national childhood immunisation schedule across the region. While progress was made until 2019, there was a decline in coverage in several countries in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Khetrapal Singh emphasized the need to focus on improving the uptake of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose, which has a relatively slow uptake with an estimated coverage of only 58% in the region in 2022. Barriers include high proportions of home deliveries, hindering timely access to the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns. Addressing inequities in immunisation service delivery, improving awareness, and enhancing training of health staff at birthing facilities are essential to optimise hepatitis B vaccination coverage. Achieving control over hepatitis B is a critical step towards eliminating mother-to-child transmission of the virus, aligning with WHO’s ‘triple elimination initiative’ that combines efforts against hepatitis, HIV, and syphilis for integrated service delivery.  The Regional Director emphasised the need for continued efforts to scale up preventive measures such as safe injection, safe blood and infection prevention and control."

This verdict was issued by a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court during the hearing of several petitions filed by Sumana and Hirunika Premachandra,  wife and daughter of the late Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra and Attorney-at-Law Ghazali Hussain, the former Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) yesterday (17). Presided over by Justice Preethi Padman Surasena including Justices Gamini Amarasekara and Arjuna Obeysekara, the Bench concluded that the former President had not followed proper legal procedure when granting the pardon to Duminda Silva. Announcing its decision, Justice Surasena stated that the former President had failed to follow proper legal procedure when granting the said pardon to Duminda Silva. He added that the controversial action resorted to by the deposed President, had also eroded public confidence in the Judiciary and therefore deemed the Pardon granted to the death row inmate as null and void before the law. The Supreme Court Bench further maintained in its verdict that the reasons put forth by Gotabaya Rajapaksa when granting the amnesty to the former Parliamentarian cannot be accepted by the Apex Court. The Bench, therefore, directed the Commissioner General of Prisons to take necessary measures to impose the impending sentence against Duminda Silva thereby overturning the pardon granted by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Silva, who was convicted by a majority verdict by a Trial-at-Bar of the Colombo High Court, over the Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra murder case was sentenced to death in 2016. The former MP then filed an appeal against his sentence before the Supreme Court while a five-member Judge Bench imposed the death sentence on Silva. The former President in 2021 granted a Presidential Pardon to the death row inmate according to powers vested in him based on the Constitution. Subsequently, the aforementioned petitioners prayed the country’s Apex Court to deem that the amnesty granted to Duminda Silva by the deposed former President was in violation of the Constitution."

Some held that all health trade unions were alike. Even doctors would first think about winning their packages before thinking of anything else.     Administrations of hospitals, including those of Teaching Hospitals Peradeniya and Kurunegala lamented that there had been issues in conducting Laboratory services, ECGs, etc, and the hospitals had only performed emergency surgeries while routine surgeries had been postponed.  They lamented that with the problems in dispensing medicines, patients had been diverted to ‘Osusala’ outlets and private sector pharmacies to obtain the quota of medicines written for them at the OPD or the Clinics.     Talks between Alliance of Health Service Trade Union leaders and Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, Acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe, Secretaries of Health and Finance Ministries and the Director General Health Services failed, with the unions deciding to finish the token strike today (17) at 8.00 a.m.  The talks commenced at 3.30 p.m. while the Acting Finance Minister and his officials held that the demand for increment of Rs 35,000 should be further analysed. It was reported that the authorities who participated in the discussion, requested time until President Ranil Wickremesinghe returns from Switzerland. The trade union representatives said that a general meeting has been called tomorrow, to discuss future trade union action, specially the possibility of going for a continuous strike after two weeks.  Secretary of the Joint Council of Professions Supplementary to Medicine (JCPSM) Chanaka Dharmawickrema said the Unions would meet today (17) and decide on further trade union measures.       While the Government Nursing Officers’ Association (GNOA) joined forces with the striking trade unions the All-Ceylon Nurses’ Union (ACNU) staged only a protest between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., Secretary of the Union, S.B. Mediwatte said, noting that his outfit had thought about the poor patients and taken the decision.  “We are not asking for what the doctors have received, but a similar economic justice as we too undergo severe hardship when performing our duties in hospitals. There are several demands that our nurses have, including this and we hope to discuss it with the Health Ministry Secretary during a meeting scheduled for Today (17).  “Also, the Government should stop creating conflicts between health sector professions. There are monetary demands that all health services have been making. Instead looking into possibilities of meeting all demands alike the Government and the Health Ministry increased the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for medical practitioners,” he charged.    However, the President of the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS), Dr. A.D.K.S.N. Yasawardene said that there was no rational for other health sector workers in different grades to get agitated as the raising of DAT allowance was merely a partial correction of an anomaly of transport related allowances, which existed in executive grade State officers and certainly not a change of the existing salary structure. He pointed out that it was a long overdue correction of the DAT allowance paid to doctors.  Meanwhile, a total of 829 troops are currently deployed in 41 Government hospitals across the island. The hospitals under the supervision are; Colombo and Kandy National Hospitals, Kalubowila, Peradeniya, Matale, Badulla and Kurunegala Teaching Hospitals, Matara, Balangoda, Avissawella, Mulleriyawa, Angoda, Eheliyagoda, Nuwara Eliya, Nawalapitiya, Moneragala, Hambantota, Debarawewa, Medirigiriya, Bakamuna, including Higurakgoda, Galoya, Hatraskotuwa, Diyabeduma, Aralaganwila, Damminna, Manampitiya, Pulastigama and Galamuna.  The tri-forces carried out daily duties performed by Hospital Assistants, the Sri Lanka Army said.  "

The President also highlighted that investors venturing into this sector can anticipate a comprehensive and unwavering policy framework in the realm of renewable energy. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during his address at the ‘Green Technology Forum’ convened on 15 January in Davos, Switzerland. The event was coordinated by the Swiss-Asian Chamber of Commerce. Speaking on the theme of ‘Paving the way to an energy secure Sri Lanka’, he highlighted the substantial potential of Sri Lanka’s renewable energy sector. He further outlined the government’s initiatives over the past two years to establish an investment-friendly environment in the renewable energy sector. Emphasising Sri Lanka’s dedication to addressing climate change, President Ranil Wickremesinghe elaborated on various measures, including the ‘Tropical Belt Initiative’, presented at the COP28 conference in Dubai. Highlighting Sri Lanka’s commitment to sustainable and green development, the President emphasised the nation’s ambitious plans and determination to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. “There is an urgent need for acceleration of global actions towards climate change mitigation. There have been multiple global forums which have resulted in numerous commitments towards this end. However, actions have fallen drastically short of commitments. “Sri Lanka is a country with a long history of renewable energy. Since independence Sri Lanka developed an extensive network of hydropower, commissioning its first major hydro-power plant in 1950. Hydropower was able to provide for most of the country’s energy needs until the 1990s. Even today, hydropower accounts for around 40% of Sri Lanka’s installed electricity generation capacity. “With hydropower largely exploited to the optimal levels, there has been an increased effort to include wind and solar power generation to the national grid. The government is now accelerating this process to ensure that by 2030, 70% of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs are fulfilled by renewable energy sources. “Reaching this target requires a large investment of up to USD 11.5 billion. However, until recently the framework for private investment in the renewable energy sector has not been very conducive. Over the last two years several measures have been taken by the government to correct these shortcomings and ensure an optimal investment climate for renewable energy is in place. “The first step was to ensure cost reflective pricing. Between 2014 and 2022 electricity tariffs had not been adjusted. This resulted in major cash flow problems for the Ceylon Electricity Board that sometimes led to payment delays to power suppliers. However, from August 2022 we have shifted to a cost-reflective pricing structure. Accordingly, electricity tariffs are revised every quarter to reflect costs on a forward looking basis,” he said.  “The CEB, which has long been a loss-making entity, returned a profit in 2023, enabling it to settle significant levels of past debt along with some balance sheet structuring. The company now has a strong balance sheet, a far stronger cash flow position, and a pricing structure that ensures liquidity. “Rigidities in the feeding tariff has also been a concern of past investors. However, this has also been addressed with greater flexibility being introduced to the tariff options, including choices between fixed tariff and variable tariff formulas,” he revealed.  There have also been legislative barriers to large scale private investment in the renewable energy sector. Those legal hurdles have also been cleared through necessary amendments to the Electricity Act introduced in 2022,” he said.  Speaking further, President Wickremesinghe said the government is in the final stages of implementing unbundling of the CEB.  “This will result in greater financial and operational autonomy for the distribution, generation, and transmission arms of the CEB, resulting in competition and transparency. Whilst private participation in generation is already available, the unbundling process will open up opportunities for private participation in distribution as well. This major reform, implemented with the support of the Asian Development Bank, will ensure the CEB operates at the frontier of efficiency, delivering the best outcome for consumers and the most competitive and efficient producers of electricity. The draft legislation for this reform was already been published last month,” he said. "

Deeyagahage – Ahangama,0,2024-01-16T20:31:00+00:00,"A person who had assisted another to rob the title Deed of a land belonging to a woman and evading Court proceedings was arrested on his return from abroad. He was sentenced to one year in prison by Galle Magistrate Isuru Nettikumara. The sentence was originally imposed by the then Galle Magistrate Harshana Kekunawela. The suspect is a resident of Meepe, Habaraduwa. The incident took place when the main suspect visited the woman who was residing in the same area and had said that her house was haunted. The suspect had then told the woman he could dispel ghosts and instructed the woman to place all documents in the house in a cupboard and that she should not open the cupboard for a week. The woman then refrained from opening the cupboard. During this time, the recently arrested suspect had visited the woman’s house with the main suspect.  Several days after the incident as the woman wanted to sell the land,  to her consternation she found that the title deeds were missing and on further examination found that the land was registered in someone else’s name with her forged signature. Subsequently, she reported the incident to the Police.  An investigation led to the arrest of the woman from Unawatuna, identified as the purported owner of the land and two individuals including the recently arrested suspect who had signed the fake deed as witnesses. The case was filed in court in 2012. By this time, the main suspect who originally registered the land in his name had passed away. The defendant woman from Unawatuna acknowledged as being the present landowner. The accused who had been evading court proceedings was sentenced to one-year Rigorous Imprisonment by the then Galle Magistrate Harshana Kekunawela and warrants were issued to arrest him. However, the accused was avoiding court appearances and finally apprehended by BIA Police officers and transferred to the Galle Police. "

This became apparent when the Government Medical Officers’ Association’s (GMOA) took up the stance that the token strike of about 70 health sector trade unions, to demand the same economic justice the Government had shown the doctors, as unfair.  The doctors argue that they belong to the senior grade while the categories that were currently striking belong to secondary and primary grades, according to the salary grades of the National Wage Policy. GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the Government has addressed only 15 per cent of the demands put forth by the doctors. In contrast, other State health service employees, who requested a  Rs 20,000 increment, have been granted a Rs 10,000 initially. This implies that the latter group has received 50 per cent of their initial demand, he said.  It is necessary to maintain the differences in salary scales between the levels in the public service, to fulfil the basis for social justice in the public service.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The IMF team met the Northern Province Governor P.S.M. Charles and several businessmen, Jaffna University representatives and small-scale traders. While acknowledging that the progress is still distant from the comprehensive growth everyone can benefit from, the initial signs of the green programme, such as food security, from pursuing reforms are promising. He stressed that these reforms are crucial to prevent the continuation of the challenging situation the country has been facing. Brueur added that the country experienced a significant 70% inflation rate last year, posing a substantial burden, especially for those without savings and buffers, who live day by day. Surviving with a 70% surge in prices becomes exceptionally challenging. However, he commended the government and the central bank for swiftly implementing a monetary policy that effectively brought down inflation, offering relief to the economic landscape. He further noted that the key to the country’s development lies in the economic policy currently being introduced. During the meeting with the IMF team, at the Governor’s Secretariat, the Governor informed them about her implementation task of the food security programme initiated by the President. Brueur attentively listened to the matters explained during the discussions, which covered various issues such as economic growth in the province, demining programmes, resettlement of conflict-displaced individuals, compensation for conflict victims and assistance for flood victims. Participating in the meeting were representatives from Jaffna University, members of the business community, and small and medium entrepreneurs. The team extensively discussed topics related to development projects in the North, the region’s infrastructure facilities, climate change, recent floods, and the challenges associated with the compensation programme. Governor P. S. M. Charles provided insights during these discussions. Representatives from Jaffna University also addressed the IMF team, highlighting the post-Easter Sunday attacks, challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the economic crisis in the North, and the impact of implemented taxation hindering the growth of the masses. The guests were further informed about prevalent corruption in the country, with an earnest call for strict measures to end corruption and regulate prices of goods. They emphasised that, facing tough times due to the economic crisis, many individuals have been severely impacted and urged the government not to impose additional taxes, alleviating them from further losses. Additionally, concerns were raised about the challenges small-scale entrepreneurs face in obtaining bank loans in the country, citing excessively high interest rates as a significant obstacle to their growth.  Breuer also acknowledged that he has become aware of the severe hardships people are facing due to the government’s introduced taxation. He recognised that the financial crisis has led to such challenging circumstances and while acknowledging the constraints, he expressed understanding of the difficult situation. However, he highlighted that there have been some positive developments in the financial sector. He emphasised that the changes in economic policies are expected to bring about further improvements."

Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industry Mahinda Amaraweera and others participated in the export of the first container of dried fish and Maldives fish produced by this factory. Traditionally, dried fish and Maldives fish are dried in the sunlight, but under this new technology, dried fish and Maldives fish is processed using an Air Condition Dehydration system. Dried fish and Maldives fish produced using completely safe and healthy methods are very suitable for human consumption. Especially due to factors such as the use of low salt to dry the dried fish and the fact that the oil contained in the fish is not removed, the quality of dried fish and Maldives fish, under this new technology, is high. This is the first time that our country’s dried fish and Maldives fish have been exported to Australia and Korea. Minister Amaraweera expressed his views: “I took initial steps to start this project when I was the Fisheries Minister in 2018. President’s Attorney Upali Mohotti, who was the Chairman of the Aquaculture Development Authority at that time, submitted proposals for this project. Today that project has been successful. There is a high probability of waste being added to the traditional dried fish and Maldives Fish preparation. Salt is used more to prevent that condition. But for the first time, there is no space for even a little dust or a fly to enter in the production of dried fish and Maldives fish in this factory, which is using air conditioning systems. “Therefore, by producing dried fish and Maldives fish using this method, we can offer dried fish that is most suitable for human consumption to the market. This will give us the foreign exchange that the country needs. Such projects can be used for all sectors in the country.”"

Speaking to the media following the raid, Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said that a network of online loan service providers, who provide short-term, high interest micro loans, as little as Rs 5,000, have commenced operating in Sri Lanka, including the company operated by the local and Chinese nationals who were arrested. Following a complaint lodged by a woman who obtained a loan from the company, the Cyber Crimes Investigation Division commenced an investigation.  According to SSP Thalduwa, the woman had failed to pay the loan and the suspects have obtained contact information on her mobile phone, created a WhatsApp group chat with the contacts obtained and has harassed her and her contacts regarding the loan she has failed to pay back.  Investigations have revealed that the company based in Dehiwala was operated by Chinese nationals and female Sri Lankan employees, since 2021, as a registered loan providing service and that Sri Lankans have also been hired to help them in their operations.  Further investigations have revealed that once the individuals who obtained the loans, which are provided in exchange for personal information, fails to pay back or even if the repayment gets delayed, the loan providing company will use illegal methods to access the individuals personal mobile phone and access the contacts within. Once the company has access, SSP Thalduwa said that the company continues to call and harass the contacts regarding the unpaid loans.  The company which has been registered initially through a Sri Lankan national was later taken over by the Chinese nationals. SSP Thalduwa further said that the Chinese nationals have also forced the female Sri Lankan employees to obtain the loans or part of it from the clients and would bar the Sri Lankan employees from leaving the premises without doing so.   Meanwhile, Director of the Computer Crimes Investigation Division SSP Darshika Kumari further advised the public to be vigilant as to the sources which they obtain loans from and to act with caution as these companies and individuals are suspected of going to great lengths to hack into personal electronic devices and social media accounts to harass individuals to obtain loans. Police are carrying out further investigations into similar online micro loan providing rackets."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/16/gmoa-says-health-sector-strikes-unfair/,GMOA says health sector strikes unfair,By Dilanthi Jayamanne ,0,2024-01-15T20:32:00+00:00,"Following the Cabinet decision to double the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors, based on a proposal put forth by the President, a division among health trade unions seems to have arisen. This became apparent when the Government Medical Officers’ Association’s (GMOA) took up the stance that the token strike of about 70 health sector trade unions, to demand the same economic justice the Government had shown the doctors, as unfair.  The doctors argue that they belong to the senior grade while the categories that were currently striking belong to secondary and primary grades, according to the salary grades of the National Wage Policy. GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the Government has addressed only 15 per cent of the demands put forth by the doctors. In contrast, other State health service employees, who requested a  Rs 20,000 increment, have been granted a Rs 10,000 initially. This implies that the latter group has received 50 per cent of their initial demand, he said.  It is necessary to maintain the differences in salary scales between the levels in the public service, to fulfil the basis for social justice in the public service. Therefore, if these categories, who are resorting to strike action want to make demands which would benefit their membership, there are many demands that are unique to their categories which should be made, he said.  Therefore, maintaining differences in salary scales between different levels in the public service is deemed necessary to uphold the principles of social justice within the public service, he claimed.  Secretary Joint Council of Professionals Supplementary to Medicine (JCPSM), Chanaka Dharmawickrema yesterday (15) faulted the President, the Cabinet of Ministers and the incumbent Health Minister for their failure to provide economic justice to other service categories engaged in the State health sector. Dharmawickrema warned the public and patients that hospital service would be brought to a complete standstill in State hospitals and urged them to refrain from coming to government hospitals. All health services including CT scans, MRI scans, all radiology tests, all laboratory tests, drug dispensing, distributing, physiotherapy, disease prevention services, immunisations and maternal and child clinics would all collapse, he warned.  Essential service will be provided while cancer hospitals, maternity and children’s hospitals, the central blood bank and special units and hospitals will be exempted, the JCPSM Secretary said.   He accused the authorities of the Health Ministry of having used medical practitioners to apply the theory of “allotment to novice monks” by increasing their disturbance, availability and transport (DAT) allowances.  Dharmawickrema warned that it would be impossible to prevent large scale exodus in the State health sector if the government failed to provide economic justice to other service categories in the State health service as well.  Meanwhile, the All-Ceylon Nurses’ Union said it decided not to join the token strike, but will only hold a demonstration in front of government hospitals during lunch time. If the government tries to deploy military to suppress the health workers’ strike, they will continue to carry out the trade union action even further, President of the Academy of Health Professionals Ravi Kumudesh said.  On 8 January 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to the State sector doctors, raising it from Rs 35,000 to Rs 70,000. Following this, several health sector trade unions launched a token strike last week, demanding an allowance of Rs 35,000. "

They only enjoy themselves at the cost of the tax payer, he charged, noting that the taxes had become so hard for our people that they could hardly make ends meet.  He recalled the grenade incident, which had occurred at a time when the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka was praying for success in discovering the masterminds behind the 2019 Easter Attacks. Other than arresting four innocent people in connection with the incident, the law enforcement officers had failed to even carry out the investigations into the matter to identify the real perpetrators responsible for having placed the grenade in the church.     “We are not agitating for disorder and anarchy in Sri Lanka. We have a right, as citizens of this country, to ensure that justice is done,” His Eminence said.      Despite the severe drawbacks, the island’s leaders are talking about war in the Middle Eastern countries taking Sri Lankan warships – “a kind of boastful thing to say that Sri Lanka would help the international armada by joining one of the island’s small warships for the fight to show the greatness and glory of Sri Lanaka while many people are starving,” he charged."

He added that SJB members have accepted President Wickremesinghe’s economic policies and will publicly support them as the Presidential Election approaches. Harrison said they (UNP) have unanimously decided to extend their fullest support and cooperation to the incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Presidential Election. Harrison stated that they are prepared to declare President Wickremesinghe as a common candidate for the upcoming Presidential Election. He alleged that individuals who escaped through the back door without taking over the Government, during the severe economic crisis, are attempting to contest the upcoming election, which he finds amusing. Harrison also claimed that only the incumbent President Wickremesinghe is eligible to contest the Presidential Election, asserting that no one else has the ability to steer the bankrupted economy of the country back onto the correct path. “Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa is eager to take over the Government but seems hesitant. His reluctance should not plunge the country into a terrible or tragic state. Today, the country requires a leader who is proficient in every aspect, possesses the capability to engage with the rest of the world and maintain diplomatic relations with them. As the incumbent President possesses all these qualifications, he is the ideal candidate for the upcoming Presidential Election,” claimed Harrison."

According to the videos that went viral, the students alleged that Sirisena is one of the masterminds of the prevailing rice shortage in the country. Upon the arrival of a group of lecturers, discussions ensued with the students, leading to Sirisena being escorted out.  When asked about the situation, Sirisena told Ceylon Today that the incident, characterised as a protest, by a small group of students, should not be given significant consideration. “It was just a group of five – six boys. There is nothing serious about it. I don’t mind such minor incidents,” he said. "

Speaking in Parliament, Dissanayake focused on two specific allocations, Rs 1.3 billion for the restructuring of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) and Rs 200 million for the President’s overseas travel, fuel, vehicle maintenance and arrears. He questioned the logic of allocating substantial sums for SLT privatisation amidst the nation’s economic hardship. Regarding the President’s expenses, he asserted, “the President should be the first person to comply with financial discipline.” He condemned the additional funds allocated after an already inflated budget for travel and vehicles. Dissanayake further scrutinised the President’s frequent overseas travels, highlighting 14 trips in 14 months, including four visits to the UK, two trips to Japan, and an upcoming ‘longest tour’ of nearly two weeks. He contrasted this with the travel patterns of previous presidents and questioned the necessity of attending summits where other world leaders were absent. Dissanayake also drew attention to the irony of the President’s travel expenses, while basic necessities like rice, milk powder, diesel and medical supplies are subject to Value Added Tax (VAT). He then turned his focus to the Rajapaksa family, questioning the continued use of State residences by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his son, Namal Rajapaksa, along with other Rajapaksa family members.

This pledge was given to the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) by the CPCEC at the recent committee meeting chaired by Dr. Harsha de Silva.  During the meeting, COPF reevaluated the Regulations under Section 71, read with Section 52(5) of the Colombo Port City Economic Commissions Act, No. 11 of 2021. The reconsideration came in response to concerns about Duty-Free Rules issued by the Port City Commission, revealing a policy inconsistency that could lead to market distortion and potential cannibalisation. During the examination of the legality of the Duty-Free Rules, the Committee sought the opinion of the Attorney General, who highlighted that the Commission lacks the authority to establish such rules.  The officials from the Port City Commission, present at the meeting, acknowledged the error and committed to revoking the rules by the end of the week. However, when the Committee sought accountability for these erroneous decisions, there was a notable absence of any official stepping forward to take responsibility. Expressing strong dissatisfaction at the lack of clarity and accountability, the Committee deemed that reconsideration of the mentioned Regulation necessary. Consequently, the Committee directed the Ministry of Investment Promotion to identify the responsible party and outline measures to prevent similar errors in the future, aiming to safeguard against potential discouragement of future investments. Furthermore, the Committee considered Gazette Extraordinary No. 2334/39, as per Section 24 of the Board of Investment (BOI) of Sri Lanka Law, No. 4 of 1978. The Gazette proposed amendments to regulations, allowing non-BOI or Section 16 BOI companies to attain Section 17 approval with exemptions for specific sectors and criteria. These amendments aim to expedite Foreign Direct Investments and facilitate collaborations between foreign companies and existing BOI entities, enabling them to benefit from customs duty exemptions. After meticulous examination, COPF approved the proposed Regulation to be presented to Parliament, expressing confidence in the consistent thresholds for companies registering for Section 17, ensuring no discrepancies were introduced. Furthermore, the Committee engaged in a discussion regarding the proposed strategy for ensuring equitable VAT treatment for both foreign and domestic providers of software and digital services. Despite administrative challenges highlighted by officials from the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), the Committee directed the IRD to present a comprehensive plan addressing these issues and ensuring the appropriate implementation of the law within one week. This proactive approach by the Committee aims to resolve potential hurdles and promote fair VAT treatment for all stakeholders in the software and digital services sector."

USAID is funding the four-year extension of support to Sri Lankan paddy farmers, which will benefit 10,000 farmers across four districts – Hambantota, Vavuniya, Anuradhapura and Kurunegala. FAO and the Ministry will help farmers diversify the use of 1,250 hectares of paddy lands during the Yala cultivation season to grow suitable cash crops. In addition, the initiative will help farmers use resources such as water and fertiliser more efficiently across 5,000 acres of paddy land. The funds will also help establish streamlined supply chains to ensure the timely availability of supplies and machinery to farmers at affordable prices. The project builds on the United States’ 2022 donation of 36,000 metric tons of Triple Super Phosphate and 9,800 metric tons of urea amid the country’s economic and food security crisis, which FAO and the Ministry distributed to more than 1 million farmers. “Our paddy farmers underwent significant challenges over the past few years,” said Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera in expressing his appreciation for the commitment to revitalise the sector. Minister further said, “USAID and FAO provided essential fertiliser free of charge for more than 1 million paddy farmers in the country at a crucial time. This initiative builds on that support to continue ensuring increased incomes for the most vulnerable paddy farmers in Sri Lanka.” “USAID is proud to continue our partnership with FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture,” said USAID Mission Director Gabriel Grau. “Our mutual goals for crop diversification and agricultural efficiency are a natural extension of our work to increase the productivity of Sri Lankan agriculture and improve the livelihoods of smallholder paddy farmers.” In remarks at the launch of the initiative, FAO Representative Vimlendra Sharan called the partnership with USAID and the Ministry of Agriculture a “significant milestone in our commitment to continue to support Sri Lankan agriculture. By combining resources and expertise, we aim to bring about positive and sustainable changes for the farming community.”   FAO and USAID emphasised their commitment to closely collaborating with the Government of Sri Lanka and other key stakeholders to ensure the success of this initiative. By fostering resilience and sustainability, the programme seeks to contribute to the overall recovery of the agriculture sector, promoting increased yield and profitability for smallholder farmers."

The Gender Equality Bill, a key component of these efforts, includes the establishment of a Gender Equality Council with representation for the LGBT+ community. The Council will also appoint Gender Focal Point officers for various government institutions. Kumarasinghe revealed the commencement of a programme to provide a complete morning meal for all preschool children in the island this year. Emphasising the challenge of ensuring a nutritious breakfast for 120,000 preschool children, she disclosed that a request has been submitted to President Ranil Wickremesinghe to increase the allocated amount from Rs 60 to Rs 100 per child.  The focus is on providing a protein-rich meal to combat the high prevalence of malnutrition among children in Sri Lanka. The initiative aims to cover approximately 120,000 non-estate and 35,000 estate pre-school children, totaling 155,000 beneficiaries. In addition to the breakfast programme, plans are underway to distribute nutrition packs to pregnant mothers, benefiting 220,214 pregnant mothers for a duration of 10 months, each valued at Rs. 4,500 per month.

The Valuation Officer had been accused of seeking a bribe amounting to Rs 35,000, from a Police Sergeant, to undervalue a State-owned land. Judge Marasinghe also fined the accused Rs 32,000 and instructed her return the bribe of Rs 35,000. The Judge stated that the actions resorted to by the accused, would be a black mark on honest public service officers. He stressed that those found guilty, would stand to invariably suffer its ramifications, for the rest of their lives. He then stated that he was imposing a lenient penalty on the accused, due to her willingness to accept her guilt from the outset, without wasting valuable time of his Court and also based on submissions, produced by her lawyer. Assistant Director General of Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Disna Gurusinghe prosecuting, told the Court, that one of the reasons, for this country’s ongoing economic crisis, is the actions of people of the caliber of the accused, who prevent the desired revenue, from being accrued to the State, due to soliciting bribes willy-nilly. President’s Counsel Nalinda Indatissa appearing for the defendant stated that his client was feeling extremely remorseful, over her actions and that she was seeking forgiveness for it.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Opposition Leader queried, “This Government is suspending the season tickets given to the schoolchildren. But they do not hesitate to spend handsomely when it comes to the parties of ruling party MPs. This is a shameless act. Former PM Mahinda Rajapaksa had also participated in this party. How can they spend State money like this when people are suffering due to challenging economic conditions?” Jayasekera mentioned that a group of 20 MPs had undertaken an inspection tour of the Colombo port in response to requests made during the budget debate. The purpose was to visit the East and West Jetty of the Colombo port and understand the reasons behind the delay in work on the West Jetty. Addressing concerns about the visit being misconstrued, Jayasekara asserted that he considered it his duty to listen to the MPs’ requests. He condemned the spread of rumors and called for action against those making false claims. Jayasekera stated that certain Trade Union members had unlawfully recorded the visit, prompting the need for a thorough investigation and subsequent arrest by the CID.

The birds were intended for display at a private zoo in the country. In a strongly-worded statement, the CEJ revealed that the individual responsible for the importation lacked the necessary licence and despite this, the birds were not prevented from being delivered. The organisation has called on the Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation, the Director General of the Department of Wildlife Conservation and the Director General of Sri Lanka Customs to conduct thorough investigations into the matter. The CEJ expressed deep concern over potential attempts by certain officials to unlawfully detain and grant licences for the imported birds, exploiting a previously obtained licence. Such actions not only raise legal issues but ,also pose a severe threat to the environment. According to the CEJ, a shipment of these birds, following an earlier importation, was prevented from being released due to a lack of documents and permits. However, the birds are currently held under the custody of animal quarantine and allowed ‘safe custody’ at the premises of the importer in Hambantota, until an investigation is completed. The CEJ emphasised the need for a comprehensive investigation into the illegal importation of exotic birds, urging authorities to take appropriate legal action against those violating the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. They called for an assessment of the birds’ origin, considering Suriname’s notorious reputation for bird and animal smuggling from the Amazon rainforest. Additionally, the CEJ urged authorities to ensure that the remaining birds are securely held in a location adhering to proper quarantine standards. In the event of authorities’ failure to respond to the CEJ’s demand within 14 days, the organisation warned that it would initiate legal action, viewing the lack of response as an inaction and a refusal to fulfil statutory and constitutional duties. The CEJ urged transparency in the investigative and corrective process, emphasising the importance of keeping the public informed about steps taken to address this environmental issue."

State Minister Siyambalapitiya also outlined the Government’s strategy to expand the tax base at this meeting with a target of increasing the direct tax percentage to 40 per cent. Acknowledging the challenges faced by individuals regardless of their economic status in these trying times, State Minister Siyambalapitiya emphasised the government’s commitment to addressing the country’s issues. He highlighted the importance of increasing State revenue for economic development, revealing that the direct tax percentage has already risen from 20 per cent to 30 per cent, with plans to further elevate it to 40 per cent. The Government is also intensifying efforts to combat the trade mafia through stringent laws preventing them from profiting unfairly. Speaking on the controversial VAT amendment introduced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the 2024 Budget, Director General of Trade Unions to the President Saman Ratnapriya said that there are major misconceptions perceived by the public, such as the 3 per cent increase for certain goods and commodities from 15 per cent to 18 per cent, and urged a thorough societal discourse on the amendment to navigate its complexities. According to the President’s Office State Revenue Unit Director K.K.I. Eranda who also spoke at the press briefing, the Government has identified inefficiencies in its VAT collection procedures, identifying three primary areas of tax leakage: failure to remit collected taxes by businessmen, irregularities by officials and losses due to tax exemptions. He added that, to stabilise the economy addressing these leakages is crucial and that the government is aiming to increase the number of businesses registered for VAT collection from 13,000 to 50,000 in the near future."

The Government has already announced that loss-making State-owned enterprises would be privatised and these three entities are on the list.   Following State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalpitiya’s announcement in Parliament about the intended privatisation yesterday (10), confusion has gripped the workers in these State-owned sectors, Arulsamy said. He emphasised that the CWC stands firm against this move, ensuring that workers’ dues, including land rights, are duly honoured to prevent injustice to those who have dedicated decades to these estates. Arulsamy raised this concern, highlighting that the matter was brought to the attention of Estate Infrastructure Development Minister Jeevan Thondaman, expressing strong opposition to the privatisation of these State plantations. He stressed that should the Government proceed with its privatisation plans, adequate compensation in the form of EPF and ETF, along with service allowances, must be ensured for the affected workers.  Further, the demand for rightful ownership transfer of the houses and lands presently occupied by the workers. He emphasised the need for a just solution, suggesting the allocation of one acre of land per worker to enable them to become small-scale tea growers, thereby providing a sustainable solution for their livelihoods."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/11/is-national-prosperity-really-possible/,Is National Prosperity Really Possible?,By Ananda Ariyarathne,0,2024-01-10T20:32:00+00:00,"“We are a Nation of Hypocrites as we never address a problem as a problem but become too diplomatic to say that yes it looks like a problem. This way, we acknowledge but never name it. It goes the same way when we try to look for answers. Take all the people we know especially the politicians and those who call themselves Advisors but are incapable of directing their masters in the right direction. Especially at a time when we do not have honest and sensible politicians and the right kind of advisors who can give the right advice, will there be a time when you start feeling more helpless and stranded than a time you can see clearly that they are nowhere near the right answers? It is very plain and clear that the problems are not that complicated as it is we who have made them complicated and it is we who have made the answers impossible. What we need is a moment of freedom to think honestly, without getting affected by false values we ourselves have created. Let us escape from such and in our small capacities, let us select the obviously plain answers.”  What is the most easily available resource? It is nothing but the Human Resources. If we organise ourselves, we shall become the Most Productive Resource. We have to escape from the mentality that we have a price and unless we make use of our potential, we shall never make use of that and we shall have no value too. Understandably, we do not like to work for others. Let us work for ourselves. Absence of genuine leadership Sri Lanka, as a country, was never interested in the need to understand the realities. Instead, we took things for granted and we did not wait to find out the truth before blaming anyone. This superficial approach made us lose the opportunity to learn the truth. We happily listened to someone and believed in whatever was said. Always, all the bad experiences were like wounds we received. At that moment of receiving it, we felt the pain and that was unbearable. Then we slowly got accustomed to bearing the pain that was generated and learned to live with the pain. Are there capable people trying to find the answers? From simplicity to confusion As a kind of people who were very simple at heart and did not have any plans to improve living conditions, they got used to getting global influence and learned to enjoy benefits if the opportunities fell in their laps. The improvements that came into the country also came in like that. It was a very natural life all lived until such time the economy started expanding all of a sudden when the plantation economy came in. The whole system became too commercialised and by that time, our economy expanded bringing in the trickling effect that reached even the bottom line where people started getting used to new trends that affected the human society in very subtle ways. The simple villager who enjoyed drinking the fermented sap tapped off the flowers of kitul and coconut trees felt as if they had reached the top of the world, a pleasant state of well-being. It was not harmful in any way. But the influence that started with the Portuguese passed on to the Dutch, especially in that direction of alcohol had already crept into our lifestyle. Toddy Tappers from Kerala had been brought to Sri Lanka to exploit the potential and by the time the British took over from the Dutch Toddy tapping and distilling arrack had become a thriving business. Slowly, the Toddy Taverns became a normal feature. This intrusion of alcoholic drinks into simple living became a normal and natural feature and it was through that the development of changes in modern living started intruding into Sri Lankan Society. Today, we have a society which has modern features as they have become the signs of compatibility. That had happened through a very gradual change in the social values which had become deeply embedded in the Sri Lankan social base. It is not a society that has acquired modern features and therefore is not an example of a really advanced Western social system. The result is it has values that are still evolving, but with the most ancient social practices which most of the time keep on influencing even the most modern features.  As a result of that, the features give misleading signals and although it is not recognised, even the specialists who plan and set the bases for implementation have their decision-making to represent their highly acclaimed academic backgrounds but are still lost in their unshakeable ancient realities. That is the reason for the absurdities caused, especially in the application of principles in taxation. Absurdities in taxation In the US economy, the expected results of taxation are applied to bring in results but in the Sri Lankan economy, only a very small portion of taxpayers get affected as the changes made are not directly applied. The indirect taxes slapped affect even beggars as well as stray dogs. The superior planners who are either unaware or not concerned about those realities keep on performing as if it is a matter of life and death importance, but ironically it is so, as taxpayers are not given any alternatives. What is really happening is that the Government is slapping taxes to compensate for the burdens of inefficiencies in administration. Let us just take taxes slapped on commodities can be meaningful only if such are applied only to imports thinking that the effect of the taxes shall encourage measures to increase the production of items that are imported. What the wise magicians who are busy performing magic shows cannot understand is that there is no ‘Rebate’ system to encourage increased production that encourages Import Substitution. This affects all and the absurdities experienced in sugar imports are ample proof.  What those who have to understand do not or simply cannot understand is the naked truth that on a prorated basis or at times through Black market mechanisms the prices go up and the cost of living is affected by that. On one hand, we are trying to pay back what we owe to the IMF but are increasingly getting involved with more commitments to overcome recurring commitments without having a proper plan to increase national productivity.  Our current problems became a trend with the open economy policy and our society was more exposed to the global economy from which the entire system got complicated and connected with global concepts accepted blindly, the initiatives taken in support and programmes introduced without proper evaluations.  Effect of liberalised imports  How much did we waste on importing unnecessary things simply because we could import anything and now, we suffer because we do not have the needed foreign exchange? If there was an opportunity to import the banks were ready to open LCs. We could import even junk. The freedom to import anything easily paved the way for very harmful chemically based fertilisers as well as pesticides and herbicides intruding into our farming practices to leave behind a highly absurd scenario where nothing can be cultivated without having the chemical agricultural support and the acquisition of such marketing opportunities by ruthless traders who have one arm in purchasing agricultural produce has left the ordinary farmers further strangled and helpless. What kind of motivation can we expect in a situation  like that?  One of the worst developments is the combination of health hazards that have evolved making the farmers becoming vulnerable to deadly ailments. Calling it the Green Revolution, those investors who wished to make money right, left and centre, to achieve profits by hook or by crook spent so much to advertise those deadly chemicals that led to the root causes which have left us several killer diseases, namely chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology and indicating that we have become clueless about the diseases even.  It is alarming to note that in 2019 alone, 300,000 metric tons of fertiliser and 5,000 metric tons of Agrochemicals had been imported knowing that arsenic is added into the environment affecting even the drinking water. It shall be important to note that Sri Lanka was identified as the Nation that uses the highest number of chemical fertilisers, that is, 284.3 kg are used per hectare compared to Pakistan using 163 kg and India using 153 kg per hectare. Nepal and Bhutan are said to be using only 7 kg and 9 kg, respectively per hectare. This shows how irrational we have become.  The deviation from the traditional fertilising and controls, we now depend on all imported chemicals and farm machinery compelling us to have the highest cost per land area. Do we actually need governments to tell us how to dig our graves?  At a time when our world is concerned about Food Security, we have achieved a sickly farmers community. It is also said the ailments develop a kind of autoimmunity and that tells us that there shall be no cure also. Where is this country heading?  Avenue for escaping  In an environment where varying inputs will have their own prices is a reality no one can deny. Although there is no hard and fast rule to determine the costs, the pricing can be logically tagged onto the values that can be connected.  A day of twenty-four can be tagged to different moods of occupation. Time left for sleeping is time left out for relaxing, seen as unproductive though it is then the energy is replenished, to last at least for twelve hours, then there can be unproductive times, and therefore one should be able to have a value enough for working hours within a day. One should be able to make enough for three meals, and all those can be valued. Taking the present costs having an average minimum of Rs 250 for a meal it shall be at least Rs 750 for meals. At least three times should call for at least Rs 3,000 per day, which shall be a very high value. Therefore, the answer has to be more workable. Even if we think it can be Rs 100 for a meal it shall be Rs 300 for a day and for thirty days it shall be at least Rs 9,000 for a month. Now, can even an unskilled worker survive with such earnings? In other words, can we hire a person for just about Rs 1,500 (Rs 45,000) or Rs 2,000 (Rs 60,000) per month? As it is, the nearest possible is about Rs 2,000 per day. That shows that the best way out is to keep the food prices low as much as possible. Can we do that with a price like Rs 200 for 1 kg of rice? If we can settle all the expenses in a day, we should need at least Rs 1,000 per day and if we can manage with Rs 1,000, Rs 30,000 per month shall be enough. This will give us a base to start calculating to generate revenues to make a “cooperative movement” based on an understandable revenue target. Then by doubling that we can correlate it to a commodity like rice. A person may earn a value enough for a certain value target. Once it is set, a person may increase productivity and it will show how a worker can get compensated.  By increasing productivity, a worker may earn 5 kg more and can give 50 per cent of the increased productivity to the worker and the other 50 per cent to the society that engages the worker. Once we can decide on a medium as the unit, we can decide on a rate for “coupons,” the number of coupons of different denominations can make matters more precise and accurate. Then, we can logically connect the value denominations of the Units in Monetary terms. That way, we can get rid of Monetary Justifications. By doing that, we shall be solving Two Main aspects and a worker shall learn to respect his or her own toiling in a more rational manner. When the worker increases effortlessly, he or she will understand how much he or she has been losing continuously all the time. The second aspect is the natural achievement of additional productivity with the same resources first and then with reduced resources secondly, will show us how much is saved for the future. By expanding the idea based on such rational thinking, we can start setting the targets. By setting the values on that basis, we shall learn to cut the costs. Then we can develop variations and have a complete basis for valuing efforts. So, it shall not be that bad to start generating value and once all get to the mood, the rhythm will take over. All the rust that has been created over the years shall disappear."

Sources said however that neither of the instructions had been implemented to date while paediatric cases in need of age-related plastic surgeries where certain reconstructions could be made was piling up at LRH.  Patients at LRH currently have to depend on NHSL Colombo to attend to their plastic surgery needs while that hospital has been forced to send some of the paediatric patients home having rescheduled surgeries. Sources lamented that LRH has been without a plastic surgeon since December 2023 as one surgeon retired in 2022 while the remaining one at LRH had migrated at the end of December 2023 which left LRH without a plastic surgeon.  The Hospital Administration in Peradeniya when contacted said if the hospital’s incumbent plastic surgeon accepted his transfer and took up the post at LRH, Peradeniya would be left without a plastic surgeon. The NHSLT, Kandy plastic surgeon was not in a position to take up the post as he is scheduled to leave the country for foreign training within a week or two. The Hospital Administration said that TH Peradeniya would be left high and dry as a new Plastic Surgery Unit had also been opened recently.  However, informed sources alleged however that the plastic surgeon from NH Kandy who was to replace the one in Peradeniya had returned after completing his foreign training and was waiting to migrate. They said that having failed to accept the transfer given the LRH he had even requested a transfer to TH Peradeniya.  Sources said that the Transfer Board had withdrawn the particular application and urged him to accept his end-post transfer to LRH."

The Government has already announced that loss-making State-owned enterprises would be privatised and these three entities are on the list.   Following State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalpitiya’s announcement in Parliament about the intended privatisation yesterday (10), confusion has gripped the workers in these State-owned sectors, Arulsamy said. He emphasised that the CWC stands firm against this move, ensuring that workers’ dues, including land rights, are duly honoured to prevent injustice to those who have dedicated decades to these estates. Arulsamy raised this concern, highlighting that the matter was brought to the attention of Estate Infrastructure Development Minister Jeevan Thondaman, expressing strong opposition to the privatisation of these State plantations. He stressed that should the Government proceed with its privatisation plans, adequate compensation in the form of EPF and ETF, along with service allowances, must be ensured for the affected workers.  Further, the demand for rightful ownership transfer of the houses and lands presently occupied by the workers. He emphasised the need for a just solution, suggesting the allocation of one acre of land per worker to enable them to become small-scale tea growers, thereby providing a sustainable solution for their livelihoods."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/11/is-national-prosperity-really-possible/,Is National Prosperity Really Possible?,By Ananda Ariyarathne,0,2024-01-10T20:32:00+00:00,"“We are a Nation of Hypocrites as we never address a problem as a problem but become too diplomatic to say that yes it looks like a problem. This way, we acknowledge but never name it. It goes the same way when we try to look for answers. Take all the people we know especially the politicians and those who call themselves Advisors but are incapable of directing their masters in the right direction. Especially at a time when we do not have honest and sensible politicians and the right kind of advisors who can give the right advice, will there be a time when you start feeling more helpless and stranded than a time you can see clearly that they are nowhere near the right answers? It is very plain and clear that the problems are not that complicated as it is we who have made them complicated and it is we who have made the answers impossible. What we need is a moment of freedom to think honestly, without getting affected by false values we ourselves have created. Let us escape from such and in our small capacities, let us select the obviously plain answers.”  What is the most easily available resource? It is nothing but the Human Resources. If we organise ourselves, we shall become the Most Productive Resource. We have to escape from the mentality that we have a price and unless we make use of our potential, we shall never make use of that and we shall have no value too. Understandably, we do not like to work for others. Let us work for ourselves. Absence of genuine leadership Sri Lanka, as a country, was never interested in the need to understand the realities. Instead, we took things for granted and we did not wait to find out the truth before blaming anyone. This superficial approach made us lose the opportunity to learn the truth. We happily listened to someone and believed in whatever was said. Always, all the bad experiences were like wounds we received. At that moment of receiving it, we felt the pain and that was unbearable. Then we slowly got accustomed to bearing the pain that was generated and learned to live with the pain. Are there capable people trying to find the answers? From simplicity to confusion As a kind of people who were very simple at heart and did not have any plans to improve living conditions, they got used to getting global influence and learned to enjoy benefits if the opportunities fell in their laps. The improvements that came into the country also came in like that. It was a very natural life all lived until such time the economy started expanding all of a sudden when the plantation economy came in. The whole system became too commercialised and by that time, our economy expanded bringing in the trickling effect that reached even the bottom line where people started getting used to new trends that affected the human society in very subtle ways. The simple villager who enjoyed drinking the fermented sap tapped off the flowers of kitul and coconut trees felt as if they had reached the top of the world, a pleasant state of well-being. It was not harmful in any way. But the influence that started with the Portuguese passed on to the Dutch, especially in that direction of alcohol had already crept into our lifestyle. Toddy Tappers from Kerala had been brought to Sri Lanka to exploit the potential and by the time the British took over from the Dutch Toddy tapping and distilling arrack had become a thriving business. Slowly, the Toddy Taverns became a normal feature. This intrusion of alcoholic drinks into simple living became a normal and natural feature and it was through that the development of changes in modern living started intruding into Sri Lankan Society. Today, we have a society which has modern features as they have become the signs of compatibility. That had happened through a very gradual change in the social values which had become deeply embedded in the Sri Lankan social base. It is not a society that has acquired modern features and therefore is not an example of a really advanced Western social system. The result is it has values that are still evolving, but with the most ancient social practices which most of the time keep on influencing even the most modern features.  As a result of that, the features give misleading signals and although it is not recognised, even the specialists who plan and set the bases for implementation have their decision-making to represent their highly acclaimed academic backgrounds but are still lost in their unshakeable ancient realities. That is the reason for the absurdities caused, especially in the application of principles in taxation. Absurdities in taxation In the US economy, the expected results of taxation are applied to bring in results but in the Sri Lankan economy, only a very small portion of taxpayers get affected as the changes made are not directly applied. The indirect taxes slapped affect even beggars as well as stray dogs. The superior planners who are either unaware or not concerned about those realities keep on performing as if it is a matter of life and death importance, but ironically it is so, as taxpayers are not given any alternatives. What is really happening is that the Government is slapping taxes to compensate for the burdens of inefficiencies in administration. Let us just take taxes slapped on commodities can be meaningful only if such are applied only to imports thinking that the effect of the taxes shall encourage measures to increase the production of items that are imported. What the wise magicians who are busy performing magic shows cannot understand is that there is no ‘Rebate’ system to encourage increased production that encourages Import Substitution. This affects all and the absurdities experienced in sugar imports are ample proof.  What those who have to understand do not or simply cannot understand is the naked truth that on a prorated basis or at times through Black market mechanisms the prices go up and the cost of living is affected by that. On one hand, we are trying to pay back what we owe to the IMF but are increasingly getting involved with more commitments to overcome recurring commitments without having a proper plan to increase national productivity.  Our current problems became a trend with the open economy policy and our society was more exposed to the global economy from which the entire system got complicated and connected with global concepts accepted blindly, the initiatives taken in support and programmes introduced without proper evaluations.  Effect of liberalised imports  How much did we waste on importing unnecessary things simply because we could import anything and now, we suffer because we do not have the needed foreign exchange? If there was an opportunity to import the banks were ready to open LCs. We could import even junk. The freedom to import anything easily paved the way for very harmful chemically based fertilisers as well as pesticides and herbicides intruding into our farming practices to leave behind a highly absurd scenario where nothing can be cultivated without having the chemical agricultural support and the acquisition of such marketing opportunities by ruthless traders who have one arm in purchasing agricultural produce has left the ordinary farmers further strangled and helpless. What kind of motivation can we expect in a situation  like that?  One of the worst developments is the combination of health hazards that have evolved making the farmers becoming vulnerable to deadly ailments. Calling it the Green Revolution, those investors who wished to make money right, left and centre, to achieve profits by hook or by crook spent so much to advertise those deadly chemicals that led to the root causes which have left us several killer diseases, namely chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology and indicating that we have become clueless about the diseases even.  It is alarming to note that in 2019 alone, 300,000 metric tons of fertiliser and 5,000 metric tons of Agrochemicals had been imported knowing that arsenic is added into the environment affecting even the drinking water. It shall be important to note that Sri Lanka was identified as the Nation that uses the highest number of chemical fertilisers, that is, 284.3 kg are used per hectare compared to Pakistan using 163 kg and India using 153 kg per hectare. Nepal and Bhutan are said to be using only 7 kg and 9 kg, respectively per hectare. This shows how irrational we have become.  The deviation from the traditional fertilising and controls, we now depend on all imported chemicals and farm machinery compelling us to have the highest cost per land area. Do we actually need governments to tell us how to dig our graves?  At a time when our world is concerned about Food Security, we have achieved a sickly farmers community. It is also said the ailments develop a kind of autoimmunity and that tells us that there shall be no cure also. Where is this country heading?  Avenue for escaping  In an environment where varying inputs will have their own prices is a reality no one can deny. Although there is no hard and fast rule to determine the costs, the pricing can be logically tagged onto the values that can be connected.  A day of twenty-four can be tagged to different moods of occupation. Time left for sleeping is time left out for relaxing, seen as unproductive though it is then the energy is replenished, to last at least for twelve hours, then there can be unproductive times, and therefore one should be able to have a value enough for working hours within a day. One should be able to make enough for three meals, and all those can be valued. Taking the present costs having an average minimum of Rs 250 for a meal it shall be at least Rs 750 for meals. At least three times should call for at least Rs 3,000 per day, which shall be a very high value. Therefore, the answer has to be more workable. Even if we think it can be Rs 100 for a meal it shall be Rs 300 for a day and for thirty days it shall be at least Rs 9,000 for a month. Now, can even an unskilled worker survive with such earnings? In other words, can we hire a person for just about Rs 1,500 (Rs 45,000) or Rs 2,000 (Rs 60,000) per month? As it is, the nearest possible is about Rs 2,000 per day. That shows that the best way out is to keep the food prices low as much as possible. Can we do that with a price like Rs 200 for 1 kg of rice? If we can settle all the expenses in a day, we should need at least Rs 1,000 per day and if we can manage with Rs 1,000, Rs 30,000 per month shall be enough. This will give us a base to start calculating to generate revenues to make a “cooperative movement” based on an understandable revenue target. Then by doubling that we can correlate it to a commodity like rice. A person may earn a value enough for a certain value target. Once it is set, a person may increase productivity and it will show how a worker can get compensated.  By increasing productivity, a worker may earn 5 kg more and can give 50 per cent of the increased productivity to the worker and the other 50 per cent to the society that engages the worker. Once we can decide on a medium as the unit, we can decide on a rate for “coupons,” the number of coupons of different denominations can make matters more precise and accurate. Then, we can logically connect the value denominations of the Units in Monetary terms. That way, we can get rid of Monetary Justifications. By doing that, we shall be solving Two Main aspects and a worker shall learn to respect his or her own toiling in a more rational manner. When the worker increases effortlessly, he or she will understand how much he or she has been losing continuously all the time. The second aspect is the natural achievement of additional productivity with the same resources first and then with reduced resources secondly, will show us how much is saved for the future. By expanding the idea based on such rational thinking, we can start setting the targets. By setting the values on that basis, we shall learn to cut the costs. Then we can develop variations and have a complete basis for valuing efforts. So, it shall not be that bad to start generating value and once all get to the mood, the rhythm will take over. All the rust that has been created over the years shall disappear."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The inspection of vegetable cultivations had been kicked off by the reps of the NFC from Ambagasdowa. Later farmers engaged in growing potatoes had highlighted the issues they faced.  The NFC team was led by Anurada Tennakoon, who told the media that the agriculture officers of the Uva Province were in a deep slumber. “It was evident to us that the potato cultivations in this Province have been destroyed beyond measure. Due to certain bacteria being contacted, there is a serious threat of potato farmers failing to obtain the requisite harvest in the Yala Season. This is a pathetic situation.  “It was also evident to us that the officials from the Department of Agriculture instead of striving to resolve burning issues of farmers are now in the habit of levelling baseless allegations against various organisations like the NFC. They are not at all interested in providing solutions to pressing issues faced by farmers but only want to pass the buck. This matter has to be looked into seriously by the Minister of Agriculture and his Ministry or else the farmers will have no alternative but to gang up against the Government. It was also clear to us that no officer from the DA has been to any of these areas to look into concerns of farmers and this is therefore a pathetic situation.  They are only known to deliberate in air conditioned rooms and submit review reports. This is their modus operandi. We believe that the damage suffered by the big onion cultivations here will befall the potato cultivations as well before long, thanks to the lackadaisical attitude of the officials from the DA. It is also imperative that some sort of compensation is paid to potato farmers due to their current plight.” "

Annarasa condemned Minister Devananda and his party, claiming that he won’t hesitate to point out the shortcomings as well as any malpractices and irregularities, without fearing for his life. During a media briefing held at Vadamarachchi Media House, Annarasa claimed that during the visit of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, a meeting between the Multi-Purpose Cooperative Societies and the fishermen had been held at the Jaffna District Secretariat on 6 January noon, but many fisheries federations, in particular, Mullaitivu, Oorkavathurai and Karainagar fisheries federations had been prevented from meeting the President. Annarasa alleged that an appeal had been made to Divisional Secretary Oorkavathurai and the Assistant Director Regional Office of the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in a letter to arrange to meet and discuss the problems of fishermen in Oorkavathurai area, but they did not receive any feedback from them. “A question would arise in the minds of everyone whether there is democracy in the matter of fishermen in Jaffna District. At a time when there is a need to give priority to fisheries-related issues in the Jaffna District, only a few societies mollycoddling the Minister had been invited to meet the President. If permission was granted to only the supporters of a particular political party why do we need the Fisheries Department, Divisional Secretariat and District Secretariat? We are also Sri Lankans, not foreigners and are entitled to the same rights as other citizens,” Annarasa said.  Annarasa alleged they might have been prevented from meeting President Wickremesinghe out of fear that they would bring up every problem the fishermen in the region were facing and striving to resolve with the support from the government and it was an act of violating the democratic rights of fishermen. “The Ministers from the majority community who were in charge of fisheries took necessary action to resolve the problems of fishermen in the North, but a Minister from the same community is giving step-motherly treatment to the poor fisherfolk,” Annarasa added."

Indian Tamils are living almost all over the world and a majority of them are in the peak economically and they must come forward to invest in Sri Lanka willingly, according to Radhakrishnan.  We are ready to provide infrastructure and other facilities to the investers. A large number of Indian origin Tamil people are living across the Central Hill Country and when the investments are made in those areas it will become a boon to those people and help improve their economic and living conditions, Radhakrishnan added."

Amaraweera claimed that numerous private zoos in China express a strong interest in having Toque monkeys from Sri Lanka. Regrettably, that plan is currently prohibited due to legal procedures, he added responding to a query raised by MP Rajika Wickramasinghe. Amaraweera revealed that initially, the plan was to send 100,000 Toque monkeys to China. When he and a group visited China two weeks ago, several private zoos expressed their willingness again about taking those monkeys. There are approximately 20,000 private zoos in China. Unfortunately, legal barriers have surfaced, leading to a court case as environmental organisations have intervened, he said The minister said there is an urgent need for alternative strategies to address the agricultural damages caused by Toque monkeys. Raising concerns over the urgency of the issue, the Agriculture Minister called for collaborative efforts between the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Wildlife to formulate a solution. He highlighted the significant agricultural losses incurred within a day due to these animals and emphasised the need to equip those authorised to deal with the situation, either by providing firearms or ammunition.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/09/sajith-petitions-sc/,SAJITH PETITIONS SC,By Buwanaka S. Perera,0,2024-01-08T20:36:00+00:00,"Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has submitted a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition to the Supreme Court, seeking an Order to reduce the existing electricity tariffs.  Premadasa, in the petition, has named the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Minister of Power and Energy and the Secretary of the Ministry of Power and Energy as Respondents. The Petitioner (Premadasa) stated that since the past several years, Sri Lanka has plunged into the worst economic crisis since independence, as a result of decades of mismanagement, lack of implementation of Government policies and political instability.  He said in the petition that Parliament Sectoral Oversight Committee, appointed to determine the causes of the economic crisis, has exposed inaccuracies in the estimation of hydropower generation, miscalculations in coal and thermal generation, flawed projections of electricity demand and inefficiencies in institutional coordination.  These factors collectively led to the PUCSL making an erroneous decision to raise electricity tariffs in October 2023. In the last three quarters, a minimum of 800,000 electricity connections were terminated because the public faced challenges in affording excessively high electricity costs and tariffs, the Opposition Leader said.  “Consequent to the Covid-19 pandemic, the emergence of the economic crisis presented multiple challenges including, but not limited to severe threats to nutrition, food security, healthcare and education affecting a vast number of families, children and the elderly, irreparable losses affecting continuity to small and medium scale business and the livelihoods of vast number of individuals.” Premadasa further stated that as the economy continued to plummet, businesses were forced to shut down while education and operation of entities were hindered due to persistent power cuts. The shortage of fuel, food and medicine resulted in the loss of public trust, paving way for a civil unrest in 2022.  “Lest one forget, that one such crisis was the electricity crisis, where sporadic power cuts even extending to 13 hours a day were experienced in the country in 2022.”  In these circumstances, the Petitioner states that the electricity sector has a fundamental bearing on all facets of life involving the economy, health, education, national security, etc. Businesses and enterprises that suffered owing to the economic crisis are now in further turmoil in sustaining themselves given the increase in electricity. Persistent mismanagement has resulted in the increase in the new electricity costs forcing small, medium and large-scale producers and manufacturing industries to downsize their production and/or the threat of complete shut down due to the inability to pay such increased electricity tariff. As a result of the increase in electricity costs, export-oriented manufacturing industries are currently focusing on investing and conducting business overseas resulting in the loss of foreign exchange, further imposing a risk of collapse of domestic small-scale industries due to the shortage of imported raw materials and in turn would result in a loss of employment, he stated.   Premadasa sought, from the Supreme Court, a declaration that the respondents PUCSL, CEB, Minister Kanchana Wijesekara and the secretary of Power and Energy Ministry have infringed the fundamental rights of the Petitioner and/or the Citizens of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. He also sought a declaration that those respondents have infringed the fundamental rights of the Petitioner and/or the Citizens of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka guaranteed under Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. Furthermore, an order is sought directing those Respondents to reduce the prices of electricity costs and/or tariffs. "

But no one assess the programmes to see if the required goals had been met.  “We request the new Health Secretary, who has been with the World Health Organisation (WHO), to measure the effectiveness and prevention projects and submit a report based on proper criteria,” Kumudesh said.  It should start from today – with the National Dengue Control Programme (NDCP). He noted that there should be a clear idea as to what are the objectives of the project were, what are the indicators proposed by the project to measure them, what percentage of the objective had been achieved, what were the areas to be developed in the next programme, how much the Project cost the State health service, the results obtained and what the justification for that expenditure should be identified. Neither the dengue mosquito nor the measles virus understands the deceptions that are done through the media shows instead an environment should be created for all stakeholders to work together.  Health service officials working at a grass roots level do not have the fuel to engage in their duties, nor can they obtain a vehicle when required. Furthermore, overtime payments and allowances are not paid for their services. The Dengue Campaign does not take into consideration any of these facilities, he said.  Kumudesh alleged that only some officials had the opportunity to hold frequent meetings in five-star hotels and travel to foreign countries for related programmes while those engaged at the ground level had no idea nor were of those programmes. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Efforts to bring more dollars to the country are hampered due to the activities of some officials at the Ministry of Finance, he added. He also said that the President will announce the decision to increase wages of plantation sector workers at the end of this month. The SLBFE opened their new branch office in Nuwara Eliya and it would provide services in the Tamil language.  Marking the recent International Migrants Day, the Labour Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, responding to a request made by the children of migrant workers, opened an SLBFE office with Tamil language speaking officers in Nuwara Eliya to provide a better service to migrant workers and their families from the area. The Minister handed over the registration documents to the first worker to depart for an overseas job after getting duly registered at the new SLBFE branch.  Minister Nanayakkara said some politicians had divided the nation by making Sinhala the only official language and added that due to such imprudent decisions he was not able to learn Tamil and as a result he is not even able to speak a few words in Tamil during the event.  He went on to say that the Government today has to take even some unpopular decisions, such as tax increases and wage cuts, to usher the necessary changes thinking about the future wellbeing of the children. The Minister said that the expatriate workers had responded positively to a request to become shareholders by sending 500 million dollars per month to the country through legal channels and they had sent nearly six billion USD to the country last year. Minister Nanayakkara said that even though the President published the necessary gazette and requested to act accordingly, the officials who took decisions during the Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksa regime were still active and they had stopped remittances from crossing the six billion USD mark. The minister emphasised that they should be held responsible for that. The Minister, responding to a request of the President’s Senior Adviser Vadivel Suresh, MP, to increase the salaries of the plantation workers, said that the President will announce the relevant decision before the end of this month."

It is guided by the current spiritual leader, Al-aalimul Faalil Ash-sheikh Ahmad Ibnu Ash-sheikh Muhammad Hafilahullah. With 18 branches across the island under the current spiritual leader, the Nabaviyyah Islamic Youth Organisations have been at the forefront of serving communities, irrespective of caste or creed, empowering youth to lead with professionalism and excellence. Established on 20 October 2003, the NIYO Galle branch has made a positive impact in its represented area. NIYO’s service is provided under five pillars: Education, Awareness, Social Welfare, Empowering the Youth and Drug Eradication. The organisation has grown from strength to strength, supporting the community in times of need. From assisting those affected by the 2004 tsunami to aiding flood victims in Malwana and Viyangalla, setting up medical camps, providing meals, dry rations and financial assistance in various calamities, NIYO has championed humanitarian causes that go beyond the community and region, reaching the nation. To mark its 20th anniversary, the NIYO Galle held a book distribution ceremony for Galle students on 30 December 2023, at the Town Hall, Galle. The event was attended by well-wishers, parents, students, and prominent community members.

Jayatilaka.  This programme, he stated, played a pivotal role in establishing a robust foundation in Sri Lanka, across social, cultural, religious and educational aspects through citizen participation. The Colombo YMBA, founded in 1898, under the chairmanship of Sir Anagarika Dharmapala and its founding chairman D.B. Jayatilaka, stands as the oldest and largest Buddhist organisation in Sri Lanka. President Wickremesinghe emphasised the need for collective progress as one Sri Lankan Nation, with a focus on the future. Acknowledging the historical significance of the Colombo YMBA, President Wickremesinghe received the launch of a special issue commemorating the 125th Anniversary and awarded scholarships to ten university students.  A group photo featuring the President, heads of the association, members of the governing board and members of the working committee was also taken. In his additional remarks, President Wickremesinghe recognised the pivotal role played by the Colombo YMBA in shaping Sri Lanka’s history. He applauded the association’s commitment to the Buddhist renaissance, initiated during a period when Christian youth societies were being established in Western countries. As part of the celebration, President Wickremesinghe announced a significant gesture, granting government-owned land in Colombo Fort to the association for an additional 99 years, with plans to develop it into a tourist area. Addressing the theme of the 125th Anniversary, ‘One Sri Lanka Discourse,’ President Wickremesinghe aligned it with the country’s current needs. He outlined plans to address war-related issues by 2025, focusing on political solutions for displaced and missing persons. Additionally, there are plans to enhance the religious centre in Nagadeepa and establish a distinctive Hindu temple in Jaffna, emphasising collective progress. President Wickremesinghe emphasised the importance of engaging with the youth, stating that their input, plans, and ideas are essential for nation-building. Looking beyond the present, he expressed the need to recreate a comprehensive national plan, uniting everyone to move forward collectively for the country’s future. The President highlighted Sri Lanka’s rich history as an agriculture-centric nation and emphasised the focus on ensuring the safe export of food crops through sustainable agricultural practices. Touching on anti-corruption measures, President Wickremesinghe mentioned the establishment of the Anti-Corruption Commission and the submission of a comprehensive report on financial control in alignment with the International Monetary Fund agreement. Addressing the political landscape, the President advocated for regulations governing political parties, with a committee studying global political processes to shape the country’s political framework. Regarding global engagement, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the importance of free trade agreements, ongoing negotiations with India and China and expected agreements with Thailand in April. He expressed the need for diplomatic ties with Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam to foster relations and open the country’s economy to the world. President Wickremesinghe called for unity to advance with a shared economic programme, drawing inspiration from the remarkable economic progress seen in Cambodia over a short period."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/09/civil-organisations-tell-govt-to-take-more-time-to-discuss-onur-bill/,Civil Organisations tell Govt to take more time to discuss ONUR Bill,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-01-08T20:31:00+00:00,"As the Government prepares to introduce the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), there’s growing concern among prominent civil society members and clerics. They are urging the Government to prioritise discussions before pushing the ONUR law through Parliament. Twenty-four individuals have collectively appealed to the government, emphasising the necessity of examining the Bill before its parliamentary consideration. They’ve proposed a crucial addition: the ONUR board should include ex-officio representatives from various bodies like the Office of Missing Persons, Office of Reparations, NGO Secretariat, and the forthcoming Truth, Unity and Reconciliation Commission. Their concern primarily centres around the potential power imbalance, raising issues about ONUR’s authority to guide and oversee peace and reconciliation programmes conducted by local organisations, potentially infringing on the autonomy of civil society. Their joint statement highlights specific problematic aspects of the proposed legislation. For instance, it’s noted that while the Minister is empowered to recommend 11 members to the ONUR for three-year terms, the chairperson’s term has no limit, a scenario deemed inadvisable. Furthermore, the Bill’s objective to ensure equal opportunities in economic, social, cultural and political spheres, while safeguarding identities and fostering inclusivity, is commendable. However, the lack of extensive public dialogue or efforts by the government to educate the general populace about the necessity and potential impact of the ONUR raises concerns. The objectives outlined in the ONUR Bill, aimed at promoting national unity and peaceful coexistence, require comprehensive engagement and dialogue among diverse community representatives in Sri Lanka, both within civil and political circles.  The commendable objectives outlined in the ONUR bill, such as promoting national unity and peaceful coexistence, require dialogue and negotiation among representatives of diverse communities in Sri Lanka, both in civil and political societies. Unfortunately, the potential importance of this new institution appears to be under-estimated by the government, its policymakers and the law’s drafters as there has been little or no effort to engage in public discussion on it or to educate the general public about the need for it.  “We, the undersigned, express three significant concerns that we believe need urgent attention. Firstly, the composition of the decision-making board within ONUR will be pivotal to its effectiveness. Presently, the appointments to the ONUR Board are at the discretion of the Minister, allowing the recommendation of 11 members for three-year terms, while the chairperson’s term remains undefined — an arrangement deemed inadvisable. We strongly advocate for a more inclusive, multi-partisan method of appointments that truly reflects the diversity across ethnic, religious, and socio-cultural spectrums. “Secondly, considering ONUR’s anticipated central role in the national reconciliation process that aims to amalgamate various independent reconciliation mechanisms, we propose the inclusion of ex-officio representatives from key bodies such as the Office of Missing Persons, Office of Reparations, NGO Secretariat, and the forthcoming Truth, Unity, and Reconciliation Commission. “Thirdly, our concern extends to ONUR’s granted authority to guide and facilitate peace and reconciliation programmes conducted by local organisations, including community-based ones. This directive capacity raises apprehensions about potential government overreach into civil society affairs. There’s a risk of politicisation, potentially veering national reconciliation policies for narrow, partisan objectives. The new law must explicitly emphasise that the government’s role is to “assist and facilitate” rather than direct civil society initiatives. “Furthermore, national reconciliation cannot be imposed hierarchically; it demands a voluntary, inclusive process involving all ethnic and religious communities. To achieve this, it’s imperative to engage civil society and elected political representatives in discussions about this new institution. Prior to passing the new law, we strongly urge the government to engage opposition political parties, especially those representing minority ethnic and religious communities, alongside civil society. A multi-partisan consensus, echoing pluralistic values, is vital to chart a genuine path towards national unity through a comprehensive reconciliation process.”  Those signed the statement were: Ihsaan A.

SLTB Chairman Lalith de Alwis, when inquired, said a policy decision has been taken not to issue school season tickets for January following a Gazette Notification from the Ministry of Education granting school holidays for the entire month. He explained that the Treasury covers ninety-three per cent of the transportation fee to provide season tickets to students. However, since the Ministry of Education has declared a full month’s holiday for January, the amount required cannot be requested from the Treasury. However, he clarified that students who have already paid for a January season ticket in December still have the opportunity to travel in SLTB buses, without any restrictions. He also said students sitting for the G.C.E Advanced Level Examination this year, as well as those studying for A/L and O/L, have been issued season tickets for weekdays, excluding Saturdays and Sundays. To obtain season tickets during the holiday month, A/L and O/L students must provide an approval letter from the principal and on submission of the necessary documents, season tickets will be issued, the Chairman said. On 3 January, the SLTB Chairman instructed depot managers to cancel season tickets to students for January. This decision was communicated seven days after students had already received their season tickets."

This advanced technology facilitates the identification of suspects who may attempt to disguise themselves or enter informally. Through this process, the fight against drug trafficking and organised crime can be conducted more successfully.  Consequently, law-abiding individuals traveling abroad and returning need not harbour undue concerns. This initiative, directed by Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles and Acting IGP, Deshabandu Tennakoon, aims to identify individuals engaged in illegal activities among both departing and arriving passengers at the airport. The objective of launching this pilot project is to prevent organised criminals who commit various crimes abroad and subsequently return to Sri Lanka using unofficially prepared foreign passports, such as forged documents, while remaining in hiding. The automated facial recognition system will identify these criminals by their faces when they depart or return to Sri Lanka. Addressing the launch, the Minister emphasised the ongoing special operation to eliminate crime from the country, highlighting the dedication of police officers in achieving positive results. Acknowledging the challenges, he stressed the importance of enhancing technology and providing necessary facilities to support law enforcement. The Minister explained that even if police manage to identify criminals within 24 to 48 hours after a crime, some criminals may flee the country through airports or sea routes during that time. The initiative to prevent such escapes through the airport was initiated several months ago by the Crime Reports Division, supported by the CID and the Information Technology Division. The Minister said he was determined not to allow any criminals to hide in the country and emphasised the collective effort required to combat the underworld, drugs, and crime. He underlined his commitment to making significant strides in the next six months, prioritising the safety of the country, its people, and children. He affirmed a readiness to take tough decisions, saying the ultimate goal was to make a notable difference in the fight against crime."

Stalin criticised the Government’s claim that VAT was only increased by 3 per cent, arguing that the burden on low-income families would be disproportionately high. He predicted that many economically disadvantaged parents would be forced to withdraw their children from school to cope with the rising cost of living. When questioned about the consequences on the education sector, Stalin accused the Government of subjecting ordinary citizens to severe hardship under the guise of economic recovery. Despite assurances of economic improvement, he said government and private sector  salaries remained unchanged. Stalin emphasised that, despite having a free education system, the increased VAT and associated expenses were placing a heavy financial burden on families. Anticipating a rise in the prices of essential school supplies, he expressed concern that ordinary people would struggle to cope with the economic strain imposed by the tax revision. Stalin highlighted the immediate impact on low-income families, particularly those with children attending 7,000 schools identified as deserving students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. He pointed out that approximately 1.1 million students receiving nutritious foods in schools would also be adversely affected. Additionally, he raised concerns about the anticipated increase in school transport fares, making transportation unaffordable for students relying on these services. Speaking further, Stalin warned that without swift action, the education system would face imminent collapse and the well-being of students, particularly those from economically vulnerable backgrounds, would be severely compromised."

We have a lot of events connected to Pongal which are happening here. We are proud that the cultural events are restored in the Tamil community,” Thondaman told ANI, India.  Thonadaman who hails from Tamil Nadu’s Sivagangai district and in charge of organising the event said that Pongal is one of the popular festivals celebrated by the Tamil community worldwide. A week-long Pongal festival has been planned with the community set to hold the Jallikattu and Rekla race on Saturday (6), he said. Thonadaman and Malaysian MP Murugan flagged off the Jallikattu event in the Sampur area. More than 200 bulls and a 100 bull tamers will participate in the competition. Jallikattu is a popular bull-embracing sport traditionally played in Tamil Nadu during the Pongal harvest festival in the second week of January. Thondaman said, “Jallikattu, Mattu Pongal continues as a part of Pongal festival. We are starting the Pongal festival with 1,008 Pongal pots and 1,500 Bharatnatyam dancers.” Over 1,000 trained bulls will be released from a closed space called ‘vadi vassal’, one after another, and  bull tamers will be on the ground in an attempt to grab the hump of the bull and hold on to it to win the award. Only one person is allowed to attempt it at a time. The traditional sport is practiced annually and is quite popular in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Madurai. In the age-old practice, a bull is released into a crowd of people and participants of the event try to grab the large hump on the bull’s back, attempting to bring the bull to stop. Due to the risk of injury, both to the participants and the bull, animal rights organisations had called for a ban on the sport. In 2014, the Supreme Court of India imposed a ban on Jallikattu but in 2017, the Tamil Nadu government passed an ordinance to allow Jallikattu, introducing regulations to ensure the safety of both participants and bulls. However, after long protests by the people against the ban, the Supreme Court in India , in May 2023, upheld the Tamil Nadu government’s law allowing  ‘Jallikattu’ in the State. A five-judge bench comprising  Justices KM Joseph, Ajay Rastogi, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar heard a series of petitions challenging Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra governments’ laws allowing the bull-taming sport ‘Jallikattu’ and bullock cart races. The Tamil Nadu government had defended the sport and told the apex court that sporting events can also be a cultural event and there is no cruelty to the bulls in Jallikattu. (ANI)"

Approximately 2,400 children were vaccinated during the programme organised by the Department of Epidemiology. The Epidemiology Unit urged parents with infants born between 7 April and 5 July 2023 to avail the opportunity to get the supplementary dose of MMR for infants. This is in the wake of a little over 710 measles cases being recorded while 50 per cent were from the Colombo District and reported from January till December last year. Between April and July, six to nine-month-old infants should be given the dose to increase immunity against the viral disease which could even lead to death, the Epidemiology Unit said.  In addition to fever, cough, runny nose, reddishness of eyes and a reddish rash were  symptoms of the  infection.  He said unlike Covid–19, the measles virus was highly contagious and the risk of complications even after five years of contracting the disease were high and could cause severe complications in children which includes pneumonia and encephalitis- brain inflammation that could result in convulsions, hearing loss and even intellectual disability. Therefore, whatever the religious beliefs and myths that one may hold it is very important for children to take the vaccine, he added."

President Wickremesinghe reiterated his commitment to addressing and resolving these concerns. Siddharthan expressed dismay over Jaffna-based politicians residing in Colombo avoiding addressing these matters. He stressed the need for a more vocal response from political figures regarding the challenges faced by the local population. He also revealed the presence of caste-based schools in the Northern Province.  The President  requested to give details about 100 such schools, assuring that these 100 schools would undergo immediate development. Moreover, the President pledged to investigate Divisional Secretariats neglecting public issues by prioritising caste.

Emphasising concerns over delays caused by Houthi attacks on shipping lines, the President cautioned that these disruptions could lead to further spikes in the cost of living. Houthis have been actively impeding the flow of commerce in crucial waterways in the region, targeting Red Sea shipping vessels. Houthi rebels claiming solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, aim at vessels with affiliations to Israel. This has been causing disruptions and raising security concerns in the busy maritime route. The Houthi rebels are a Yemeni rebel group involved in the ongoing conflict in Yemen. They have been designated as a terrorist organisation by several countries, including Saudi Arabia and the United States. Due to recent attacks by the rebels, Saudi Arabia took the decision to halt oil exports through the Bab Al-Mandeb Strait. This critical passage in the Red Sea serves as a crucial route for global oil transportation, but its security has been compromised by recurrent Houthi assaults launched from the Yemeni coastline controlled by the militia. Speaking at the Shilpa Abimani 2023 Presidential Handicraft Award ceremony held yesterday (4), the President said, he does not want the rupee to depreciate further. He said, the Ukrain- Russian war is ongoing and with the war between Israel and Hamas prices of goods can increase. “At present, the Houthi rebels are in the Red Sea firing missiles at cargo vessels and this put a halt to the transport of goods.  If the vessels do not operate through the Red Sea and take the long route passing South Africa, the prices of commodities will increase further. “Hence, to fight against the Houthis on  the Red Sea, we have agreed to send one Navy vessel to the Red Sea to protect the cargo ships from the rebels.”  The international community, particularly led by the United States, is strongly urging Yemen’s Houthi rebels to cease their attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea. The statement from the White House emphasised the immediate necessity to halt these illegal assaults and demanded the release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews. Failure to comply could lead to severe consequences. The signatories of the statement include the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, and eight other countries. Notably, Bahrain, the sole Middle Eastern signatory, participated despite its tense relations with Iran an ally of the Houthi rebels in Yemen."

Apart from the hotline, the public can inform such incidents via 0112 444 444 or [email protected].  The inauguration took place under the patronage of Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles. Through the dedicated unit, the Child and Women Abuse Prevention Bureau diligently investigates crimes against children and women, including sexual violence, domestic violence, child insecurity, child labour, and cruelty to children. The unit offers a vital avenue for adolescents who may be hesitant to directly approach Police Stations to lodge complaints, allowing them to report incidents through the provided email address and hotline numbers without compromising their well-being. In response to such complaints, the 24-hour Public Complaints Cell, overseen by the Director of the Child and Women Abuse Prevention Bureau, promptly takes necessary actions in coordination with relevant Police Stations and other agencies. Addressing the event, Minister Alles highlighted the significance of the initiative, acknowledging past instances where children or women faced violence or helplessness without receiving adequate assistance from the Police. To address potential concerns about reporting, Minister Alles emphasised that the call centre employs only female Police Officers. This decision aims to create an environment where women can speak openly without hesitation when discussing their problems. The overarching goal of these operations is to safeguard the children of the country and secure their future. Minister Alles asserted the commitment to continuously battle against such crimes without yielding to external influences. He emphasised that there would be no amnesty for those involved in such offenses. In the previous year alone, around 8,000 complaints were submitted, with approximately 3,000 related to social media.  Minister Alles mentioned ongoing efforts to introduce an online safety bill, with the proposal set to be submitted on 23 January. Public input about the Bill is invited until 8 January, with the possibility of including suggestions under consideration, he added.   Minister Alles affirmed that these measures aim to ensure the safety of the children and women of the country, despite opposition from some politicians and sections of society. He expressed confidence that the people would support these initiatives."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The initiative, designed to protect victims and witnesses under Act No. 4 of 2015, involved discussions with the National Child Protection Authority on multiple occasions. The official noted that discussions had taken place with the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses, focusing on methods for obtaining evidence from children and ensuring the protection of victims and witnesses. However, the communication systems, equipped with audio-visual capabilities, purchased for Rs 43 million in 2022, have not been put into operation. In 2021, the Cabinet approved the establishment of nine video recording units across the nine provinces to record the testimonies of sexually abused children for legal cases. Despite government proposals to set up these units in hospitals covering all provinces, the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) has only implemented them in two locations to date. A senior official from the National Authority for the Protection for Victims of Crime and Witnesses expressed concern that the government’s efforts to videotape the testimonies of children, who are subjected to abuse, for legal cases have not been effectively implemented. Failure to provide proper protection to victims and witnesses undermines the societal benefit envisioned by the Act for the Protection of Victims and Witnesses of a Crime No. 4 of 2015. The official emphasised the need for a robust mechanism to support witnesses and victims directly and indirectly involved in crimes, particularly in the face of increasing crime trends in the country."

Explaining they said, that one of the two plastic surgeons serving at LRH had retired at the end of 2022, while his successor was yet to assume duties as he had not been released from his post in Teaching Hospital Peradeniya. He too, shows no inclination of wanting to come. In the meantime, the remaining Plastic Surgeon at LRH had migrated overseas at the end of December 2023 which left LRH sans the speciality of Plastic Surgery, while the requirement till now was covered by the Plastic Surgeons at National Hospital Colombo.  As a result, the Health Ministry and the Hospital Authorities in Kandy have been urged by concerned parties to release the Plastic Surgeon from his duties to take up his post at LRH. They further said, the transfer to the LRH position had been made from the End Post List.   The Central Province had three Plastic Surgeons stationed at the Sirimavo Bandaranake Children’s Hospital in Kandy and Teaching Hospital Peradeniya. In the midst of this crisis the Health Ministry had allocated a Plastic Surgeon to the General Sir John Kotelawela Defence University (KDU) heightening the shortage crisis.  The country’s requirement for Plastic Surgeons is 18, while currently Sri Lanka has only 12. The existing total too, had been allocated for LRH. Although it had also been decided that the provinces should have two plastic surgeons each Sabaragamuwa, Eastern and Uva Provinces had none. Adding insult to injury the hospital in the least populated District, Jaffna had two Plastic Surgeons serving in it. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Speaking at a press conference at Sirikotha, Kariyawasam assured that measures had been taken to grant concessions and relief to the people, allowing them to lead a life free from hindrances or difficulties. He urged the public to be patient and cautious until the government unveils its proposed plans. Highlighting the government’s success in meeting financial obligations without resorting to printing currency or borrowing from State banks, Kariyawasam expressed confidence in the government’s ability to revise taxes and provide relief promptly. Acknowledging the undeniable rise in the cost of living and the complexities introduced by tax revisions, Kariyawasam emphasised that these challenges would be short-lived.  He reiterated the President’s commitment to prioritising relief for the people, attributing recent economic difficulties to adverse weather conditions affecting vegetable production and the agriculture sector. Kariyawasam clarified that essential commodities were not subjected to new taxes and tax concessions had been granted to the health and education sectors. Contrary to claims that VAT had increased to 18%, he clarified that only 3% had been added to the existing 15%.  Responding to the allegations made by the Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB), Kariyawasam challenged them to publicly present alternative plans, stressing the importance of political parties having stable plans and policies to address economic crises. He concluded by stating that the government would show no mercy to traders who artificially inflate prices of essential commodities. Kariyawasam reiterated that the President’s efforts to bring about systemic change might be bitter in the short term but would prove beneficial in the long run."

I will never forget you and every day I am thankful to God for your love and friendship. I miss you a lot, which I am sure you know. It has been five years since your life was taken. It’s hard to believe how fast time has passed since we last spoke. Some days, I think that all of this is a dream and that I will see you again. I miss your laugh and your lame jokes. I miss you, I miss you, I can’t say it enough. Each sunset reminds me of your smile, the way you’d brighten every moment and even though you are not here, each day ends with the memory of your laughter. You are forever alive in my heart. Death leaves a heartache, that no one can heal. Love leaves a memory, that no one can steal. I still remember all the times you and I had together from home to school and tuition class.  You know, it is hard to believe that it has been five years. The laughter, the memories, they still feel so fresh. I catch myself reminiscing about our times together, and it feels like you are here with me. Priyani, I know this loss hits you and Milinda so deeply. You both are a wonderful wife and a son. I know this day of Kenneth’s birthday is very difficult for you both, but I wanted you to know that I am remembering Kenneth. I want to share with both of you a comforting prayer; Praise be to God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort those in any troubles with the comfort we have received from God, for just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.           Dear God, on this day, the 76th birthday of my dear friend, I pray for his peace and happiness in your divine presence.

Their bodies were found inside a house in Kahantota, Malabe and the Police believe it was a murder-suicide. The Police identified the other victims as a 24-year-old university student residing in Rasal Watta in Yakkala and a 34-year-old youth from Thivolpura, Ambalangoda. The youth found dead in a lodge on Parana Road, Maharagama, yesterday (3), had shown signs of poisoning as well.

Ltd. (SHMA) of A. Baur & Co. Pvt Ltd., also known as Baurs opened its second learning centre of Skills for Sustainable Growth (SSG) programme at the Kandy National Youth Corps. Following its first centre at Matale last Month, Kandy was chosen being a focal point for the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation together with whom Baurs has forged a private and public sector partnership to implement the SSG programme and a majority preference from the applicants from across the island. Over 70 students have successfully enrolled at the Kandy learning center, from different areas in the country including Ratnapura, Moneragala, Kurunegala, Negombo who are now boarded in close proximity to the Kandy National Youth Corps. SHMA is also planning to call out for its second intake during the beginning of 2024. The SSG programme in Kandy is carried out by veteran hotelier Sam Rajamanthri who gears students through various learning techniques to gain employability skills. Many renowned hotels in the area have already shown their support of the SSG programme, and have extended their scope to provide internship opportunities for students. Some students have already made it through the interview and selection rounds for the blended learning phase. Students had the opportunity to experience a study tour at the Hotel Grand Kandyan, where the hotel staff expressed their encouragement and guidance to the students in their future career plans. These value added  live hotel experiences enable students to gain industry exposure prior to entering on-the-job training, preparing them for a successful internship. SHMA has also implemented the Learning Management System (LMS) to enhance the study programme at the Kandy learning centre. The LMS enables and facilitates lecturers in seamlessly delivering lectures and effectively monitoring and planning their tasks in advance. The LMS also gives students access to additional learning content at their fingertips and are monitored during their on-the-job experience. The course content is based on a Swiss Vocational Skills Development (VSD) curriculum, including 70% practical and 30% theoretical lessons, followed by the on-the-job learning at star class hotels and restaurants. Further, students have access to various soft skills development workshops including life skills training with team building activities. Distinguishing itself from the existing hospitality education model in Sri Lanka, the SSG programme stands out with a unique approach. Approximately two-thirds of its nine-month curriculum are dedicated to addressing both student and industry requirements, emphasising hands-on practical training through internships. In classroom soft skill development is a highlighted topic among the rest of the hospitality related courses we offer during the programme. To produce highly qualified world-class hoteliers, SHMA is an education institute licensed to deliver the VET (Vocational Education Training) by EHL Professional Diploma program offering specialised tracks in Culinary, Food & Beverage, and Hotel Operations, provided by École hôtelière de Lausanne, a pioneer in hospitality education since 1893."

In addition, parents in the Colombo District who have taken the jab from the private sector could also attend the vaccination drive in the relevant private health care facility on Saturday (6).  Dr. Ginige said although there was a slight down turn in the number of measles cases being reported, it was advisable to take the supplementary vaccine dose.  Fielding questions, the Epidemiology Chief said that having received the certification of Measles being eradicated in 2019 the first few cases reported last year were imported after which the disease started to spread.  However, the fear is that the disease would spread in the country once again and reach epidemic proportioned.   Meanwhile, Former Secretary of the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians and Paediatric Specialist at Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) Dr. Channa de Silva said, in addition to the fever, cough, runny nose, reddishness of eyes and a reddish rash were also symptoms of the viral infection.  He said unlike Covid -19, the measles virus was highly contagious and the risk of complications even after five years of contracting the disease were high and could cause severe complications in children which includes pneumonia and encephalitis- brain inflammation that could result in convulsions, hearing loss and even intellectual disability. Therefore, whatever the religious beliefs and myths that one may hold it is very important for children to take the vaccine, he added."

Perera,0,2024-01-03T20:31:00+00:00,"Opposition leader MP Sajith Premadasa expressed grave concern over the recently increased Value Added Tax (VAT), asserting that it will exacerbate the suffering of the people and in his opinion, may even lead to tragic outcomes such as deaths resulting from economic hardship.  The Opposition leader was addressing an event at a school in Gampaha on Tuesday (2). He highlighted the distressing trend of reported suicides linked to families struggling to meet basic household needs, including providing basic necessities for children. Criticising the Government, the Opposition leader claimed that its decisions, such as implementing the new VAT in January, contribute to the prevailing hardship experienced by the populace. According to him raising VAT wasn’t the only method the Government had to increase State revenue. Premadasa slammed the Government of being ineffective in reclaiming stolen assets, attributing this failure to their alleged collaboration with individuals involved in corruption. He also said the current administration, having secured key positions through alliances with corrupt individual lacks the will to address the issue adequately. The Opposition Leader also alleged that the Government was more inclined to shield wrongdoers than to apprehend them, contending that their actions prioritise the protection of individuals involved in corruption over justice and accountability. "

These challenges exacerbated poverty, hunger, and escalated conflicts, leading to a decline in trust among nations, he said.  However, the Secretary-General emphasised that blame and the proliferation of arms are not the path forward. Instead, he pointed out the need for unity as the source of strength to address the interconnected challenges faced by humanity. Looking ahead to 2024, the Secretary-General issued a rallying cry to rebuild trust and reignite hope. The focus is on fostering collective solutions that transcend divisions. This includes addressing urgent climate issues, creating economic opportunities and establishing a fairer global financial system that benefits everyone, he added.  A key theme in the message is the imperative to combat discrimination and hatred that affects international relations. The Secretary-General advocated for the responsible embrace of new technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, ensuring that they serve the greater good of humanity. The United Nations commits to persisting in its efforts to rally for peace, sustainable development, and human rights, he said and called on the global community to make 2024 a year dedicated to cultivating trust and hope in our shared potential."

Clause 13 further empowers the Commission to conduct searches, inspections, and seizures with magistrate-issued search warrants. It permits the acquisition of necessary evidence for ongoing investigations. The Commission is authorised to seek necessary assistance, including from foreign governments, to fulfil its mandate. It possesses the authority to resolve local conflicts to support reconciliation at both macro and policy levels. Clause 13 says it also grants the Commission the power to decide on the confidentiality of received information. Furthermore, Clause 16.2 enables prosecutions by the Attorney General’s Department based on the Commission’s findings. The Commission will also have the mandate to search and inspect identified premises under the authority of a search warrant issued by a Magistrate, and examine, make copies of, extract from, seize and retain, any object that is deemed necessary for any investigation being conducted by the Commission and to ensure that any such site that may have been allegedly used for torture or illegal places of detention are located and preserved. The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 shall, mutatis mutandis apply in such instances. They also will have the mandate, to seek the assistance of the Sri Lanka Police as necessary to advance the investigations of the Commission; (zc) to make an application to a Magistrate, having jurisdiction, to excavate sites of suspected graves or mass graves and to act as observers at such excavations or exhumations.

The Commission will be located in Colombo and may conduct its sittings in any place in Sri Lanka and the Commission shall reflect the pluralistic nature of Sri Lanka, the Bill elaborates. The Bill says it’s a truth-seeking mechanism, anchored in the right of all Sri Lankans to know the truth as an integral part of their right to an effective remedy, will contribute to the promotion of national unity, peace, rule of law, coexistence, equality with tolerance and respect for diversity and reconciliation among the people of Sri Lanka and non-recurrence of disharmony and violence for the well-being and security of all Sri Lankans including future generations"

Discussions  focused on the compensation process related to the disaster and support was sought from the expert committee appointed by the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) to assess damages. MEPA officials informed the committee about the challenges they face in obtaining information from the Attorney General’s Department regarding the activities and future needs of their expert committee. Although a letter seeking clarification was sent to the Attorney General’s Department, a reply has still not been forthcoming, according to MEPA officials. They further disclosed that the Ministry of Justice has informed them about the appointment of an international, independent expert committee to continue assessing the damages. Consequently, the MEPA expert committee has not made a definite decision on the next steps. The committee highlighted the lack of awareness within MEPA regarding the activities of the Attorney General’s Department in this matter, emphasising the need for coordination between the institutions involved. It was revealed during the committee meeting that payments relating to research activities conducted by the MEPA expert committee have not been made. In response, the Ministry has been urged to submit a cabinet paper to explore the possibility of making these payments. Additionally, it was disclosed that no appointments have been made to the expert committee for 2023. Prof. Ajith De Alwis, co-chairman of the MEPA-appointed expert committee, informed the committee that inquiries about educational qualifications had been made by relevant universities. The Committee to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has also inquired about the appointment and educational qualifications of two members appointed to the expert committee. The committee addressed concerns arising from the lack of coordination between the Marine Environmental Protection Authority, the Ministry of Fisheries, and the Attorney General’s Department, particularly in relation to compensation for fishermen affected by the disaster. The Committee Chair instructed the Attorney General’s Department, the Ministry of Fisheries, MEPA and the members of the expert committee appointed by MEPA to jointly prepare a programme and submit a report to the committee.

They said despite VAT coming into effect from 1 January, chemical fertiliser brought to Sri Lanka was sold with the new VAT, giving businesses to take advantage. Farmers also allege a conspiracy to raise fertiliser prices by levying VAT on chemicals such as Urea, Muriate of Potash (MOP) and Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) in the country. They said many businesses were selling fertiliser at inflated prices without issuing proper bills. Meanwhile, Mahinda Amaraweera, Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries allaying these fears said the Government was committed to remove VAT on fertiliser in the upcoming Yala season.  He discussed this matter with the President, who responded positively, assuring that chemical fertiliser will continue to be available to farmers at the old price during the Yala season. Amaraweera also revealed plans to control the price of insecticides and herbicides by selling the products at a minimum price through two State owned fertiliser companies. Steps will be taken to prevent the future sale of pesticides at varying prices, he added. During a programme to distribute coconut saplings in Sooriyawewa, the Minister said fertiliser required for this season have been imported at old prices and the Government does not intend to impose VAT on them.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Customs spokesperson, Senior Director Seevali Arukgoda, said yesterday (1) that this amount represented 109 per cent of the amended revenue targets set by the Ministry of Finance, which were initially Rs 893 billion. The original revenue target for Sri Lanka Customs at the beginning of 2023 was Rs 1,217 billion, but due to the unstable economic situation in the country, it was revised to Rs 893 billion. According to the spokesperson, the previous highest revenue collected by Customs was Rs 923 billion in 2023, with a considerably lower revenue of Rs 708 billion in 2022. In 2018, the revenue generated from automobile imports was Rs 180 billion when there were no restrictions, but this figure dropped significantly to a recorded low of Rs 10 billion last year. He highlighted the achievement of reaching this figure last year with only 990 staff members, while the stipulated number of employees should be 1,547. He mentioned, “We are performing our duties with a shortage of one-third of employees at present.” The best-performing divisions of Customs last year were the Central Valuation Directorate, with a 400% increase, Preventive Directorate, Revenue Task Force (RTF), Central Cargo Examination Directorate and Post Clearance Audit Directorate. Arukoda credited the planning and action plans introduced by the Director-General of Customs for helping achieve this outstanding target."

Dissanayake highlights the need for collective action in the face of economic crises, increased taxes and the looming threat of selling off national resources. The release begins by acknowledging the difficulties faced by citizens, as the Ranil -Rajapaksa regime imposes new taxes, including an increase in VAT from 15% to 18%. Notably, 97 types of goods, including essential items like diesel, petrol, electricity bills, school and agricultural equipment, have been newly subjected to taxation. Dissanayake asserted that these burdens will lead to an unsustainable rise in the prices of essential goods, placing an immense strain on the populace and pushing local industries to the brink. “According to the neoliberal economic policies of the last four decades and International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions, the government is poised to sell off critical resources, including water and even dairy cows. Plans to lease 32 State-owned dairy farms and 28,000 acres of land to Amul are presented as indicative of a broader trend,” he said.  Dissanayake also warned of the Government’s intention to introduce new suppression laws, raising concerns about potential limitations on civil liberties. Dissanayake contended that these crises will force citizens to reconsider the existing political landscape and assess the viability of the current governance system. In the face of these challenges, the JJB leader called  for unity among progressive forces, irrespective of ethnicity or religion. Dissanayake urged citizens, producers and business people to join hands and strive for a brighter future. The upcoming presidential election is identified as a pivotal opportunity for the Sri Lankan people to reshape the nation’s destiny, he added.  Dissanayake, expressing optimism, noted early signs of people coming together with determination. He called on all progressive forces to collaborate in rewriting the history of Sri Lanka, aiming for a society characterised by economic independence, social justice and human dignity."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

A spokesperson for Civil Organisations yesterday (2) said they (the organisations) had submitted a letter to the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of the CID during a discussion held two weeks ago to be handed over to the IGP calling to strengthen the security of MCPA President, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa and civil organisation activists who played a key role in bringing to light corrupt medicinal drug deals including the Human Immunoglobulin scam which took place in the Health Ministry last year. However, the lack of action on the part of the DIG of the CID prompted the Organisations to directly complain to the IGP and the NCPV. Protection was sought for Dr. Sanjeeva, Jamuni Kamanta, Sanjay Mahawatta, Rasika Koralage and a few other organisation leaders actively involved in revealing the corruption that had taken place in the Health Ministry. The disclosures regarding weak administration and management mechanisms in the state health service, questionable drug purchases and procurement processes which contributed to the economic crisis and resulted in several killings in addition to the impact caused by those revelations to former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella, Board Member of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Manoj Gamage, pharmaceutical companies which benefited from these crooked drug deals and the Health Ministry officials connected with them make it necessary to ensure the safety of the MCPA President and civil organisation leaders.

Convener of the Civil Organisation Mage Rata (My Country) Sanjay Mahawatta said the CID’s probe into the alleged forged documentation presented at the Customs during the Immunoglobulin scam was disappointing as they seemed to overlook investigating the former CEO of the NMRA Dr.  Vijith Gunasekara and Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Saman Ratnayake. ​"

The birds were intended for display at a private zoo in the country. According to Sri Lanka Customs, the airplane, that carried 330 exotic birds, arrived from Suriname. Sri Lanka Customs Spokesperson Seevali Arukgoda said due to permit issues, the birds were prevented from being released. The individual responsible for bringing the birds possessed a prior licence for bird importation, but during the previous import, a number smaller than the permissible number of birds were brought in. Arukgoda mentioned that the importer believed they could bring and release another batch of birds with the same licence. However, he clarified that, typically, import permits allow items not brought in the first shipment to be brought in the second, yet, due to the live birds, the Customs decided to conduct further investigations. Arukgoda indicated that the importer was advised to obtain permits again, suspecting potential harm to native Sri Lankan fauna and flora by these birds. The birds were placed under the custody of officials from the Animal Production and Health Department of Mattala Airport.  He emphasised that the birds are being kept in a secure location under the importer’s supervision until the necessary permits for bringing them to Sri Lanka are finalised. However, environmentalists alleged that certain officials are attempting to unlawfully detain and grant licences for the imported birds by misusing a previously obtained licence.  Environmental lawyer Dr. Jagath Gunawardena, speaking to Ceylon Today, stressed that the Sri Lanka Customs’ actions in this incident contradict the existing legal framework. He pointed out that importing foreign birds without a necessary licence is a violation, emphasising that a licence issued for bird importation cannot be reused. Dr. Gunawardena pointed out that importing exotic birds without proper permits violates Section 37 of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. He highlighted that neither Sri Lanka Customs nor the Wildlife Conservation Department has the authority to recommend re-licensing for the illegally imported birds and keeping them in the possession of the alleged perpetrator is legally flawed."

Upon her arrival at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), Katunayake, it was evident that the victim, Sureni Wasana, was in poor health, struggling to speak properly or walk. She shared her harrowing ordeal with the media, detailing the abuse she endured. “I was employed at a house in Al Asad as a domestic aid. I left for Saudi Arabia on 6 December 2022, due to the acute economic situation at home and to improve our lives. The head of the household, a businessman, attempted to sexually abuse me one day when nobody was around at the house in June last year. I resisted, managed to leave the house, but not before he assaulted me. Subsequently, I fell ill with a fever that worsened, rendering me unable to work. The employer then handed me over to the job agent in that country. The agent, named Sultan, continued to assault me and violently banged my head against the wall three times, causing me to lose consciousness. Fearing for my life, they admitted me to a hospital, where they put stitches to my head and kept me in the ICU for several months,” she alleged.  Sarath Jayantha Peiris, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Human Rights Organisasion, an NGO, who intervened to bring Wasana back to Colombo, highlighted that in many instances, employers in Saudi Arabia tend to assault migrant workers by slamming their heads against walls to conceal evidence. He said that the woman would receive additional medical treatment upon admission to the District General Hospital Negombo. He emphasised that she had legally registered with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) and had gone through a job agency in Maradana before flying to Saudi Arabia."

The flowers were apparently offered in prayers and homage to the sacred Sri Pada site. Peak Wilderness Sanctuary is the third largest nature reserve in Sri Lanka. It spreads over 224 square kilometres. Photos had been circulating yesterday (1), on various social media platforms, depicting a large basket of flowers containing protected flora within the Sri Pada Reservation.  According to the photos, the basket contained a number of flowers including Gordonia speciosa and Loxococcus rupicola, protected by the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.  Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) Ranger of the Samanala area B.P. Siyasinghe, when questioned about the matter, revealed that they had initiated an inspection of the photos posted on Facebook, in this context. He mentioned that inquiries were ongoing to identify the individuals responsible for sharing the photos. Upon contacting DWC Director General Chandana Sooriyabandara, he revealed that he had not yet received official information about the alleged incident. However, he warned that if it is confirmed that a flower basket was indeed prepared with protected flora, legal action would be taken against those violating the provisions of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.  Researcher Bathiya Gopallawa expressed concern over the trend of offering flowers made from preserved flora to religious places of worship. He emphasised the potential seriousness of this issue and highlighted that certain flora and fauna from the Sri Pada Reservation are unique and not found elsewhere in the world. Gopallawa disclosed that approximately 60 per cent of plants in the Samanala area are at risk of extinction, emphasising the urgent need for officials to take prompt action to preserve them for future generations. Senior environmental lawyer Dr. Jagath Gunawardena emphasised that removing or damaging plants in a protected area is a punishable offense under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. Specifically, he highlighted that the road to Siri Pada falls under the jurisdiction of the Peak Wilton Sanctuary and the remaining land is part of the Samanala Reserve. Dr. Gunawardena pointed out the illegality of damaging plants on such protected land, as outlined in Sections VI and VII of the Wildlife and Flora Protection Ordinance, and said that even without a warrant, it is an arrestable offense. He further noted that it is also improper to harm plants native to Sri Lanka, safeguarded by Section 42 of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, within such territories. Dr. Gunawardena drew attention to the critical role played by the flowers of threatened plant species in the butterfly site, explaining that they are crucial for breeding another generation. Cutting these flowers disrupts the natural breeding process in the area. Additionally, Dr. Gunawardena highlighted the potential risk of damaging the plant itself when removing the flowers of endangered species. Consequently, he stressed the importance of widespread public awareness and proper law enforcement to safeguard rare plants and flowers."

I resisted, managed to leave the house, but not before he assaulted me. Subsequently, I fell ill with a fever that worsened, rendering me unable to work. The employer then handed me over to the job agent in that country. The agent, named Sultan, continued to assault me and violently banged my head against the wall three times, causing me to lose consciousness. Fearing for my life, they admitted me to a hospital, where they put stitches to my head and kept me in the ICU for several months,” she alleged.  Sarath Jayantha Peiris, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Human Rights Organisasion, an NGO, who intervened to bring Wasana back to Colombo, highlighted that in many instances, employers in Saudi Arabia tend to assault migrant workers by slamming their heads against walls to conceal evidence. He said that the woman would receive additional medical treatment upon admission to the District General Hospital Negombo. He emphasised that she had legally registered with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) and had gone through a job agency in Maradana before flying to Saudi Arabia."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/01/new-year-brings-soaring-prices-of-goods/,New Year brings soaring prices of goods,BY Mithun Jayawardhana ,0,2023-12-31T20:36:00+00:00,"With the dawn of the new year, a staggering rise in Value Added Tax (VAT) takes effect as of today (1), triggering a notable upswing in the prices of an extensive array of goods and services. This includes passenger transport bus fares, three-wheeler fares, telecommunication service charges, mobile phone prices, animal food prices, hospital room charges, domestic gas cylinder prices, petrol prices, auto diesel prices and prices of snacks, including plain tea and milk tea. There is a notable increase in the prices of various services. The existing 15 per cent VAT for goods and services will be increased to 18 per cent from 1 January and items and services that were previously exempt from VAT will now be subject to it. Attention has turned to the owners of passenger transport buses and tricycles, who are contemplating adjustments to transport charges in light of the VAT increase. Anjana Priyanjith, General Secretary of the All-Ceylon Private Bus Owners Association said due to the VAT increase, minimum bus fare should be increased to Rs 35. Similarly, Lalith Dharmasekara, Chairman of the All Ceylon Three-wheeler Drivers Association said with the price of petrol set to be Rs 50 from January, the fare for the first kilometre must be increased. Unlike previous instances where tariff adjustments did not accompany government fuel price increases, he stated that it is now impossible to avoid a fare hike. Samith Senarath, President of the Mobile Phone Sales and Sellers Association, said due to the VAT increase, prices of all types of mobile phones will see an approximate 35 per cent surge starting tomorrow. Consequently, this price hike is expected to lead to a nearly 50 per cent decline in the mobile phone market. Further, telephone companies have announced that taxes related to telecommunication services will rise by over 42 per cent from today (1). The total tax value for local calls, text messages, and additional services is set at 42.02 per cent, while the total tax value for data and international calls is 23.50 per cent. Some phone companies have also indicated that although the amount of data on some prepaid data cards has been reduced, their prices, inclusive of taxes, will remain unchanged. The All-Ceylon Bakery Owners’ Association has decided to raise the price of snacks, including plain and milk tea. The Association specified that the price of a cup of plain tea will increase by Rs 5, a cup of milk tea by Rs 10, shorteats would increase by Rs10 while fried rice and kottu will see a Rs 25 increment. The rise in VAT is expected to result in an increase in liquor prices ranging from Rs 90 to Rs 150. According to liquor companies, this surge is attributed to the imposition of VAT on various components, including ethanol, empty liquor bottles, liquor labels, caps, and bottles containing manufactured liquor.  Consequently, a bottle of arrack, presently priced at Rs 3,260, may see a hike of Rs 90, bringing the new price to Rs 3,350. Meanwhile, Litro Gas Company sources revealed that due to the implementation of VAT today, the price formula of Litro Gas will be disrupted. Consequently, a revision in the domestic LP gas price will be implemented from this morning, deviating from the usual practice of revising prices on the 4th of every month at midnight, as per the Litro gas price formula."

According to Police Spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa, the CCD officers were carrying out a sting operation in Matara to arrest persons who aided notorious drug kingpin and gangster Nadun Chintaka aka ‘Harak Kata’ to carry out his botched escape attempt last September.  Following the investigation, CCD officers took one of the arrested accomplices of Harak Kata in a white van to a hotel in Palana, Weligama at around 2.30 a.m. on Sunday, to help apprehend another suspect who was a close acquaintance of Harak Kata. At this point, the suspect had escaped from the van and sought refuge in a nearby hotel, from which many other unidentified individuals had began shooting at the van carrying the CCD officers. They had in turn fired at the hotel. SSP Thalduwa said  during the ensuing crossfire, a passing police patrol vehicle attached to the Weligama Police Division had mistaken the CCD van to be a vehicle owned by an organised crime group and started shooting at the van.  He also said following the incident two CCD officers sustained injuries and the van had fled the area to get to the nearby highway entrance, upon which officials arranged an ambulance to take the injured officers to the Teaching Hospital Karapitiya. One of the CCD officers, Police Sergeant Upul Chamindakumara (46) succumbed to injuries on arrival at the hospital, and the injured Sub Inspector is receiving treatment. SSP Thalduwa did not confirm if the CCD officer’s death was a result of police gunfire, citing reports of the crossfire between the CCD officers and the unidentified shooters at the hotel prior to the arrival of the Police patrol vehicle. SSP Thalduwa also said that a special investigation is being carried out, under the supervision of Senior DIG in charge of the Southern Province to probe the incident."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/29/dayasiri-ready-to-join-presidential-race/,Dayasiri ready to join presidential race,By Buwanaka S. Perera,0,2023-12-28T20:36:00+00:00,"Ousted SLFP General Secretary, MP Dayasiri Jayasekara, expressed his willingness to contest the forthcoming Presidential Election if the majority of his Party consents. He revealed this at a press conference held on Wednesday (27). Furthermore, he insisted that before the Party agrees to such an action, his Party membership, revoked by former President Maithripala Sirisena must be reinstated. Jayasekara argued that the vacuum left by leftist progressive nationalist political forces cannot be filled by the outdated politicians from the 1950s who make up the majority in SLFP, SLPP and UNP. Refuting claims about former President Sirisena running for the presidency from the SLFP and the possibility of former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa running for elections, Jayasekara indicated that SLPP will focus on corrupt businessmen for the role. He asserted that spaces occupied by these outdated politicians should be given to a younger generation of politicians, expressing his readiness to take on the responsibility if given the opportunity. According to Jayasekara, his 27-year-long political career, graduation from the University of Colombo and legal background, make him a suitable candidate, particularly in comparison to corrupt politicians whom SLPP prioritises. Jayasekara emphasised having a more comprehensive plan for Sri Lanka, noting the need for a leader willing to collaborate with professionals, intellectuals, or a democratic leader chosen by the people to rescue the country from the current situation. He expressed preparedness to make necessary sacrifices to achieve this goal. Responding to a question about Minister Mahinda Amaraweera’s allegation of his joining the SJB, Jayasekara denied any intention to join SJB and criticised Amaraweera for alleged opportunism. He clarified that ongoing multilateral and bilateral meetings have not influenced his decision to join hands with SJB. Jayasekara alleged that many SLPP MPs are direct and indirect beneficiaries of President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s Government, valuing ministerial portfolios more than their party or its values. While commending President Wickremesinghe for positive policies and actions since assuming office, Jayasekara warned that the austerity measures and inconclusive privatisation policies of the country’s financial strongholds could result in disastrous consequences. Despite the division within SLPP, which Jayasekara claims is between pro-SLPP MPs and pro-Ranil Wickremesinghe MPs, he urged the public not to take the risk of electing non-career politicians and to choose a president from experienced politicians. If inexperienced individuals are elected, he also asserted that he would not be held responsible for a repeat of the disaster that occurred in the previous government."

Three members have been appointed to the Commission which includes Justice Niel Iddawela as the Chairman. The appointment of the commission had earlier drawn the ire of President Ranil Wickremesinghe towards the Constitutional Council (CC). President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday (28), announced Justice W. M. N. P. Iddawela as the Chairman of the Bribery Commission with Chethiya Goonesekera and K. Bernard Rajapakse as the other members. The appointments will be effective from 1 January 2024. This decision aligns with Article 41B of the Constitution and Section 4 of the Anti-Corruption Act No. 9 of 2023. To maintain the independence of the Bribery Commission, the appointment of members of the Commission is made by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council and their removal could only be made by Parliament and only on the grounds of misconduct and incapacity. The President who addressed Parliament on 23 November advocated the formation of a select committee to investigate delays attributed to the CC. The Speaker affirmed his plan to address the President directly, stating, “I will write to the President and clarify the CC’s stance on the issues he raised.” In response, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena who is the Chairman of CC acknowledged the error in the 22nd Amendment where the Constitutional Council was mistakenly referred to as the Constitutional Board. Speaker Abeywardana emphasised that this error caused the delay in appointing members to the Bribery Commission. He said no one should be held accountable for this oversight, stating, “You cannot blame anyone for this error.”"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Kantar Sri Lanka, hosted its annual knowledge-sharing event, Kantar Lighthouse 2023, at the King’s Court, Cinnamon Lakeside and unravelled compelling insights around the young generation, Gen Z in Sri Lanka, through sessions that included key trends impacting the overall business landscape and their implications on brands.    The conference was attended by top leaders from a diverse range of brands present in Sri Lanka. The distinguished guests included CEO, Kantar APAC – Leung Cheong Tai, Executive Managing Director, Insights Division, Kantar South Asia – Deepender Rana, and the Executive Committee of Kantar South Asia.  Head of Kantar Sri Lanka – Himalee Madurasinghe, emphasised the crucial necessity of comprehending the prevailing pulse of the people. She explained the myriad experiences individuals have undergone in recent years, leading to unprecedented shifts in behaviour. “The resultant impact on businesses has been profound, leaving little room for proactive planning or anticipation of these transformative changes. While certain sectors show positive momentum, the journey towards reclaiming past levels of achievements is anticipated to be gradual.” Madurasinghe emphasised that the profound understanding of consumers remains a paramount concern, given the evolving landscape. “Notably, the emergence of Gen Z into the workforce introduces novel and intriguing behavioural patterns that demand thoughtful consideration from brands and their custodians.” In reaffirming Kantar’s commitment, Madurasinghe reiterated the company’s dedicated role as a facilitator for providing invaluable insights into these nuanced dynamics. CEO, Kantar APAC – Leung Cheong Tai, shared insightful observations with the audience, shedding light on three overarching trends prevalent in the APAC region. With a succinct articulation, she outlined these trends as “Do more with less, Unlearn to build brands of tomorrow, and Do well by doing good.” In his engaging address, Executive Managing Director, Insights Division South Asia – Deependra Rana, presented a compelling perspective on the integration of artificial intelligence within Kantar, aptly titled ‘Kantar and Artificial Intelligence – Future is Here.’ Rana illuminated how this technology serves as a catalyst for ‘Generative AI = Humanizing EI (Enhanced Intelligence)’, ushering in a paradigm where AI enhances human capabilities. The evening’s focal point was the exchange of information and insights encapsulated within the theme – GEN Z – Unravelled. Shevanie Senanayake and Nuwani Jayasuriya skilfully took the audience through a captivating presentation. “Gen Z, the demographic cohort aged between 11 to 26 years, took centre stage in our exploration, with a specific focus on those aged 15-26 for this study, constituting 23% of the population. These Gen Zers emerged as alchemists, reshaping the societal norms of Sri Lanka. While Gen Z can sometimes be enigmatic, they represent a puzzle, embodying a complex and multifaceted identity composed of various pieces that together form a cohesive whole. Our exploration delved into five distinct facets of this generation, casting light on their identity.” The facets categorised as Neo-Traditional, Aspirant, Go-Getter, Phygital (Physical and Digital) and Explorer, offered a nuanced understanding of Gen Z. The study not only reaffirmed known behaviours, but also unveiled new perspectives, empowering marketers and businesses to appreciate the significance of these findings for making informed decisions.  Gen Z and Gen Y make up 50% of Sri Lanka’s population with 25% being Gen Z. As per Kantar’s National Demographic and Lifestyle Survey (NDLS), Gen Z is present in 58% of our households and is not only influencing the buying power shift, but they are also a part of a large-scale cultural shift. The Study showcased that religion is a key pillar and spirituality is held dear with 92% of Gen Zers saying – ‘Faith guides my life’. In addition, while culture is important to Gen Z, their need to progress is not held back by tradition. They are considerate of others but do not want to be restricted by unreasonable social norms, such as opinions on attire, grooming and the company they keep, in particular, they do not judge and wish not to be judged. An overarching commonality is that Gen Z are passionate about creating positive change. They are not politically aligned, but keen to have their voice heard. This applies to many aspects of their lives, be it the products they use, the brands they love or hate and even what they experience in everyday moments. Gen Z are exposed to career options available to them and are also aware of the competitiveness of the job market. They aspire to gain qualifications, with 55% aspiring for a degree or a higher qualification. Employers can expect individuals who are qualified yet still hungry for more qualifications. They prioritise freedom and independence, with 63% aspiring to be entrepreneurs. However, this pursuit of independence alone may not guarantee business success; despite knowing their goals, they look for guidance to acquire the necessary knowledge. Almost half of Gen Z are in the workforce at present, however, they have clear expectations of work conditions, where pay takes precedence, but flexibility and working hours are also considered important. These factors entice Gen Z towards a job and encourage them to remain there. Gen Z lives with technology and has a strong online presence. 94% of them are on the Internet daily which is their preferred source of information. As a result of this, Gen Z has wide exposure to international movies, celebrities, advertisements, pop culture and music at a younger age. It shapes their thinking behaviour and the way they act and experience the world. At the same time, it is interesting to note that Local content is consumed across digital and traditional media – 49% watch daily local content on TV while 44% consume it through social media. Being globally exposed to topics such as equality, sustainability and social awareness encourages Gen Z to connect with brands that are ethical, eco-friendly and better for the community. Most are willing to reject brands that are unethical and stop following celebrities and influencers who cross the line.  Each generation plays its part in upholding and adding to our culture and values; now, Gen Z stands as the resounding voice of the nation."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/28/beyond-the-basics-advanced-physiotherapy-techniques-for-stroke-recovery/,Beyond the basics: Advanced physiotherapy techniques for stroke recovery,By Ashan Kavisekara,0,2023-12-27T20:32:00+00:00,"As a physiotherapist, my journey in stroke rehabilitation has been a continuous quest for innovative and advanced techniques to enhance the recovery journey of my patients. In this article, we will explore ‘Beyond the Basics: Advanced Physiotherapy Techniques for Stroke Recovery,’ shedding light on cutting-edge approaches that go beyond conventional methods. Neuroplasticity and constraint-induced movement therapy Neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to reorganise itself, is a fundamental concept in stroke recovery. Advanced techniques harness this principle, with Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) standing out prominently. CIMT involves restricting the movement of the unaffected limb, compelling the use and strengthening of the affected limb. This intensive approach encourages neural rewiring, fostering improved motor function. Robot-assisted rehabilitation Advancements in technology have paved the way for robot -assisted rehabilitation, offering precise and controlled movements tailored to individual needs. Robotic devices aid in repetitive and task-specific training, promoting motor learning and functional recovery. Integrating robotics into stroke rehabilitation has shown promising results, offering a new dimension to our approach. Mirror therapy for improved motor imagery Mirror Therapy is an intriguing technique that utilises a mirror to create the illusion of movement in the affected limb by reflecting the unaffected limb. This enhances motor imagery, promoting neural activation and reorganisation. I’ve observed the positive impact of Mirror Therapy in restoring motor function and reducing pain perception among stroke survivors. Functional electrical stimulation Functional Electrical Stimulation involves applying electrical currents to specific muscles, triggering contractions. This technique aids in muscle strengthening, coordination and re-education. FES has become an integral part of our advanced physiotherapy arsenal, offering tailored interventions for patients with varying degrees of motor impairment. Task-Specific Training and Dual-Task Paradigms Beyond traditional exercises, advanced physiotherapy emphasises task-specific training, where activities mimic real-world challenges. Dual-task paradigms, incorporating cognitive tasks alongside motor activities, enhance the integration of cognitive and motor functions. Implementing these strategies has showcased their effectiveness in addressing multifaceted challenges faced by stroke survivors. Transcranial magnetic stimulation for targeted brain stimulation Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation involves the application of magnetic fields to specific brain regions, modulating neural activity. TMS has emerged as a non-invasive method to assess and stimulate brain areas involved in motor control, offering insights into individualised treatment approaches. Aquatic therapy for low-impact rehabilitation Aquatic therapy provides a buoyant environment, reducing the impact on joints while allowing for resistance-based exercises. Integrating aquatic therapy into stroke rehabilitation has demonstrated positive outcomes in terms of mobility, strength and overall well-being. Music and rhythmic auditory stimulation The power of music in stroke rehabilitation cannot be overstated. Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation synchronises movements with external auditory cues, enhancing gait and motor coordination. Incorporating music and RAS has proven to be a culturally resonant and effective approach, making rehabilitation more engaging for our diverse patient population. Tele-rehabilitation for accessibility In a dynamic and evolving healthcare landscape, tele-rehabilitation has gained prominence. This approach allows patients to receive physiotherapy services remotely, overcoming geographical barriers. Tele-rehabilitation has emerged as a valuable tool, ensuring continuity of care and promoting accessibility to advanced physiotherapy services. Conclusion As a physiotherapist, the integration of advanced physiotherapy techniques into stroke rehabilitation reflects our commitment to providing the best possible care for our patients. Beyond the basics, these innovative approaches not only enhance functional outcomes but also contribute to the overall well-being and quality of life of stroke survivors. It is essential to note that while some of these advanced techniques are actively utilised and show promising results, the landscape of rehabilitation is continually evolving. In certain contexts, factors such as accessibility, patient suitability, and evolving medical standards may influence the adoption of specific techniques. Nevertheless, by embracing these advanced techniques where applicable, we aim to pave the way for a future where stroke rehabilitation transcends limitations and offers newfound hope for recovery.

While recognising the emphasis on the living, Prof. Perera stressed that the deceased too should be treated with dignity and their bodies should be cremated with respect. Referring to the 2004 tsunami disaster, where around 40,000 people were estimated to have perished in Sri Lanka, Prof. Perera said not even ten per cent of them were definitely identified. Many were buried in mass graves, with the government resorting to unconventional measures in handling the deceased. He spoke of the burial of foreign nationals in a similar manner, but due to pressure from foreign embassies, their bodies had to be exhumed to confirm their identities. Even today, numerous persons have not had the opportunity to see the bodies of their loved ones who perished in the tsunami. While acknowledging the measures taken by the Disaster Management Act (DMA) and the Disaster Management Centre in areas such as building plans and arrangements for displaced individuals, Prof. Perera highlighted the Act’s lack of focus on those killed in disasters. He proposed the setting up of mobile morgue in at least one hospital per district to bury those killed in disasters. Temporary storage facilities should be set up with the suggestion of selecting a main hospital in each district and providing the necessary resources for this purpose, he pointed out. "

President of the association Mahinda Dodampegamage expressed concerns about the lack of a comprehensive tourism plan and inadequate parking facilities in Nuwara Eliya, regardless of the increasing tourist arrivals. Despite the surge in tourist numbers, the current infrastructure does not support smooth travel to many of the popular spots in Nuwara Eliya due to the absence of proper parking lots. He emphasised the urgent need to replace the outdated tourism plan that has been in place for several years. Advocating for the swift implementation of a new tourism plan, Dodampegamage stressed the importance of developing a special travel plan that incorporates a well-thought-out vehicle strategy. This, he believes, would facilitate both local and foreign tourists in enjoying their visit to Nuwara Eliya, ensuring their needs are met without inconvenience. While acknowledging the past profitability of the tourism industry, the chairman lamented the current severe downturn, attributing it to the substantial increases—115% in water fees and 118% in taxes—imposed arbitrarily by the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council. He called for the attention of both the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council and the Government to address these issues promptly. He emphasised the critical necessity of formulating and implementing special plans for Nuwara Eliya Tourism Town.  This includes revising the existing tourism plan, establishing sufficient parking facilities, and addressing the economic challenges faced by businesses in the tourism sector. The collective effort of local authorities and the Government is paramount to ensuring the sustained growth and success of Nuwara Eliya as a vibrant tourist destination, he added. "

The main event was organised near the Peraliya tsunami memorial statue.  The DMC also announced the initiation of a new programme to raise awareness about tsunami dangers. Major General (Retd) Sudantha Ranasinghe,  Director General of the Disaster Management Centre, said the awareness campaign will be facilitated through a unique approach—using a caller tune ringtone on mobile phones. Yesterday (26) marked the 19th anniversary of the 2004 tsunami, a catastrophy that stands out as one of the world’s deadliest and most destructive natural disasters, impacting over 10 countries in the Indian Ocean. The devastating undersea megathrust earthquake, registering a magnitude of 9.1, originated off the coast of Sumatra Island, Indonesia, on that fateful Sunday morning of 26 December 2004.  The ensuing series of turbulent waves wreaked havoc on the coasts of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, the Maldives, Myanmar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The cumulative death toll from the disaster exceeded 230,000 in just a matter of hours. Sri Lanka bore a heavy toll as one of the hardest-hit countries, with over 40,000 fatalities and substantial property damage. Events were organised in the districts of Jaffna, Batticaloa and Ampara in memory of those who lost their lives. In the Jaffna district, an was held at the Jaffna District Secretariat chaired by Ambalavanar Sivabalasundaran, Jaffna District Secretary.

Initial investigations showed that the stock of potato seeds had been stored incorrectly. It has been revealed that due to incorrect storage, bacteria had developed in the potato seeds and this had resulted in the 21 metric tons being deemed unsuitable for cultivation. The Minister said officials who had been entrusted with the task should take the blame for it and added that further action would be taken after receiving the report."

Deeyagahage – Ahangama ,0,2023-12-25T20:36:00+00:00,"Out of the 77 towers constructed along the island’s coastal areas to provide early warning signals in the event of a tsunami, 57 towers are currently out of service, according to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC). The distribution of these tsunami early warning towers, built after the 2004 tsunami disaster, across various districts is as follows: Colombo District (2 towers), Gampaha District (5 towers), Kalutara District (6 towers), Galle District (8 towers), Matara District (7 towers), Hambantota District (9 towers), Puttalam District (4 towers), Ampara District (8 towers), Batticaloa District (7 towers), Trincomalee District (7 towers), Mannar District (3 towers), Mullaitivu District (3 towers) and Jaffna District (5 towers out of a total of 6). Currently, 11 towers are operational, and 9 are in a state where they can be operated normally, while around 57 towers are out of service. The technology for these towers was provided by the American Signal Corporation, and they are manned by security personnel from the Sri Lanka Army and Sri Lanka Police at the district level, overseen by disaster management units. Despite efforts to upgrade the towers after construction, the technology has become obsolete, and the American Signal Corporation has discontinued its services. The DMC has conducted public rehearsal programmes and established daily performance checks to assess the effectiveness of these towers.  However, due to financial constraints, creating a technical device for tsunami early warnings is challenging.  The centre is seeking recommendations through an expert committee to address the technical performance of the towers, considering concerns about their deterioration and potential risks if they were to collapse due to their proximity to the sea."

The WHO also urged people to take protective measures. “The Covid-19 virus continues to evolve, change and circulate in all countries globally. While current evidence suggests the additional public health risk posed by JN.1 is low, we must continue to track the evolution of these viruses to tailor our response.” “For this, countries must strengthen surveillance and sequencing, and ensure sharing of data,” said Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia. WHO has classified JN.1 as a variant of interest following its rapid global spread. In recent weeks, JN.1 was reported in multiple countries, and its prevalence has been rapidly increasing globally. Considering the limited available evidence, the additional public health risk posed by JN.1 is currently evaluated as low at the global level, Singh said. It is anticipated that this variant may cause an increase in Covid-19 cases amid a surge of infections of other viral and bacterial infections, especially in countries entering the winter season. “As people travel and gather for festivities during the holiday season, spending a lot of time together indoors where poor ventilation facilitates transmission of viruses that cause respiratory diseases, they must take protective measures and seek timely clinical care when unwell,” said Dr. Khetrapal Singh. The Regional Director also emphasised the importance of vaccination against Covid-19 and influenza, especially for people at high risk. “All WHO-approved Covid-19 vaccines continue to protect against severe diseases and deaths from all variants including JN.1,” she said. In May, following a sustained decline in the trajectory of Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths, and high levels of population immunity to SARS-CoV2, WHO declared that Covid-19 no longer constituted a public health emergency of international concern. While considerable progress has been made in establishing and strengthening a global system to detect and rapidly assess risks posed by SARS-CoV2, testing and reporting of Covid-19 cases has decreased. With Covid-19 continuing to circulate at high levels globally, countries must strengthen surveillance, sequencing and reporting to effectively manage respiratory diseases and to protect people’s health, the Regional Director said.

Francis, celebrating the 11th Christmas of his pontificate, presided at a solemn Christmas Eve Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica and spoke of the conflict in the Holy Land in his homily. “Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,” Francis said. The 87-year-old pontiff spoke hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to fight deeper into the Palestinian enclave of Gaza after his troops endured one of the worst days of losses of their ground war. And in the city where Jesus was born, Palestinian Minister of Tourism, Rula Ma’ayah, said: “Bethlehem is celebrating Christmas with sadness and sorrow because of what’s happening in Gaza and in all the West Bank, all Palestinian territories.” At the papal Mass for 6,500 people in St. Peter’s Basilica and more watching on screens in the square outside, Francis said the real message of Christmas is peace and love, urging people not to be obsessed with worldly success and the “idolatry of consumerism.” He spoke of “the all-too-human thread that runs through history: the quest for worldly power and might, fame and glory, which measures everything in terms of success, results, numbers and figures, a world obsessed with achievement.” Francis said that while many might find it hard to celebrate Christmas in “this world that is so judgmental and unforgiving”, they should try to remember what happened on the first Christmas. “Tonight, love changes history,” he said. Francis has made numerous appeals for a ceasefire in the conflict raging in Gaza and has called for the release of all hostages held by Palestinian militant groups. Hamas and Islamic Jihad, both sworn to Israel’s destruction, are still believed to be holding more than 100 hostages from among 240 they captured during their 7 October rampage through Israeli towns, when they killed 1,200 people. Since then, Israel has besieged the Gaza Strip and laid much of it to waste, with more than 20,400 people confirmed killed, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run authorities, and thousands more believed dead under the rubble. The vast majority of the 2.3 million Gazans have been driven from their homes and the United Nations says conditions are catastrophic.  (Reuters) "

In a statement, the ministry said tests conducted over the past few months have shown a very low number of reported  Covid-19 cases. In response to this, health officials in the country have taken proactive measures, collecting samples from major hospitals nationwide, particularly focusing on the recent days. These samples, collected in accordance with relevant technical instructions, have been sent to the Medical Research Institute for testing. The statement highlighted that none of the samples have tested positive for Covid-19. The Ministry of Health further said as advised by experts, preventive measures against the spread of respiratory diseases, including Covid-19 and influenza, remain crucial. Recommendations include wearing masks in closed, poorly ventilated and crowded places, frequent hand washing, maintaining social distancing and practicing proper cough and sneeze etiquette. Additionally, the statement emphasised that individuals above 60 with chronic illnesses and pregnant women are at an increased risk of complications from respiratory diseases. Therefore, they are urged to exercise extra caution and follow recommended health guidelines."

The initiation of the pilgrimage involved the ceremonial transfer of the sacred ‘Karanduwa’ (casket of relics), regalia and statues of the Gods of Saman Devalaya from the Sri Pada Temple in Galpottawala, Pelmadulla, to Sri Padaya through four main roads. This procession began on the preceding day (25). Ven.

On 24 December evening, devotees were granted permission to worship the sacred Karanduwa and the statue of God Saman, which were placed in a secure chamber. Vedda Chief Uruwarige Wannila Aththo performed a traditional honey offering to God Saman. The procession of the holy casket and the statue of Saman Deva took place on the morning of the 25th after religious rituals at Sripada Rajamaha Viharasthana in Galpottawela. The scheduled route included Ratnapura, Hatton, Balangoda and Kuruwita roads. To ensure the safety of pilgrims and arrest those in possession of liquor or other intoxicants, Police posts were operational at Gangulathenna Ratu Ambalama and Seethagangula, in addition to Nallathanniya and Hatton Police stations. This included monitoring activities at the Hatton Railway Station and along the Sri Pada route from Nallathanniya. Ven.

The public was strongly advised not to succumb to false, baseless and suspicious information causing panic. The Department dismissed these rumours, emphasising the potential for unnecessary confusion and panic among residents in the coastal areas of Sri Lanka. Director General of the Meteorology Department, Athula Karunanayake, asserted that predicting the time or date of a possible tsunami or earthquake without scientific evidence is impossible. He highlighted the continuous operation of the International Tsunami Information Centre (ITIC) and other international tsunami early warning centres all year round, urging people not to be misled or alarmed by such rumours. Despite the occurrence of a tsunami on a Poya Day, Karunanayake assured that the current rainy weather does not indicate the possibility of a tsunami. Residents were advised not to panic. Meanwhile, the Department said showers will continue over certain parts of the country on the following day (26). Meteorologist Chaminda Perera anticipated an increase in showers or thundershowers over the Northern, Eastern and North-central provinces. Spells of showers were expected in the Eastern Province and the Northern, North-central and Uva provinces. Showers or thundershowers were expected in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Galle and Matara districts after 2.00 p.m. Fairly strong winds from 30 to 40 kmph were expected in the Eastern slopes of the Central Hill Country, Eastern, Uva, North-central provinces and Hambantota District.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/26/cat-makes-history-in-sydney-to-hobart-yacht-race/,Cat makes history in Sydney to Hobart yacht race,Author not found,0,2023-12-25T20:32:00+00:00,"When Oli queues up on the starting line for the Sydney to Hobart yacht race on Tuesday, he’ll be making history. That’s because Oli is a cat. Since the event began as a casual cruise down the east coast of Australia in 1945, it has attracted all manner of colourful competitors – from media magnate Rupert Murdoch to Australian cricket legend Michael Clarke and former UK Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath. But there’s no record of any feline seafarers in the gruelling regatta. Carrier pigeons – sure: they were once used to send messages back to shore and have graced many a deck during the ocean classic. But cats? No. Oli’s owner Bob Williams says the pair didn’t set out to be pioneers. The moggy is simply part of the furniture on Sylph VI and leaving him behind on the boat’s jaunt south was out of the question. “I’ve done lots of crazy things, but this isn’t one of them,” Williams told the BBC ahead of the race. Organisers – while initially bemused – are also on board. There are no race rules prohibiting animals, and cats have a long history in maritime travel, the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia pointed out. “One of the great things about the Rolex Sydney Hobart is all the wonderful characters in the race and the diversity of boats,” Commodore Arthur Lane said. While most eyes will be on the speedy super maxis – giant yachts with up to 24 crew – during the Boxing Day race, Sylph, a 12m (40ft) yacht made in 1960, will set off in the two-handed division where smaller boats compete with a slimmed down team. “We’re jokingly saying [it’s] the two-handed and four-pawed division,” Williams said. A friend of his is co-skippering, he explains, and as for Oli: “He’s SC – ship’s cat.” While Sylph is an old hat – having taken part in six Sydney to Hobarts many decades ago – this is Mr William’s first time racing it. But both he and Oli have plenty of experience at sea. A retired navy officer, Williams has spent his life traversing the ocean – including a recent single-handed circumnavigation of the globe – much of it with a feline companion by his side. Oli, who is about 10 years old, joined him five years ago and quickly earned his sea legs. “He used to get seasick, and he was a bit stressed to start off with… but now he’s fine. He quite enjoys life,” Williams said. The laidback kitty can usually be found meowing orders or napping on the job in the boat’s cockpit. “He’s very sensible… Whenever it gets rough, he’ll disappear down below to find a nice, safe spot to curl up.” And get rough it just might. The 630 nautical mile (1,166km) dash has long been characterised by unpredictable and often brutal conditions – the worst, 25 years ago. Competitors in the 1998 race were battered by a monster storm, which sank five boats and claimed the lives of six sailors. This year forecasters have warned that the fleet could be in for thunderstorms, strong winds, and even hail along parts of the course. Williams jokes that he hasn’t lost a cat at sea yet. But turning serious, he stresses that he is prepared for any emergency. “The cat overboard routine is just to have something like a towel or a thick rope handy so that they can climb back on board.” There’s no life jacket for Oli though, because he simply wouldn’t wear it: “They’re Houdinis… they’ll escape from anything they don’t like,” Williams says. But although cats hate the water, he knows for a fact Oli can swim, because he once legged it into the ocean to avoid an overzealous dog. Sylph and her occupants will be playing it safe though and proceeding towards Hobart at a comparatively leisurely pace. The record for the fastest finish – set in 2017- is one day and nine hours. But that was a massive, modern super yacht built for speed. “Sylph is an older slower boat… Our ambition is to get to Hobart in time for the New Year’s celebration.” There they’ll mark the occasion with a nip of rum, and perhaps some milk on the rocks for Oli.

I hope that you enjoy all of the different surprises scattered throughout the music video when you watch it”.

The couple had come to the hotel through a travel service company with the aim of deceitfully obtaining insurance money from their home country, the hotel management alleged.  The Romanian couple, on an 8-day visit to the country, planned a two-day stay (24 – 25 December) at the tourist hotel and a subsequent visit to Kandy on 26 December, according to a member of the hotel management.  The couple booked a room on arrival at the hotel. On 24 December night, the 35-year-old woman requested a massage service offered by the hotel. The hotel management arranged for a female masseuse to provide the service. Subsequently, the woman insisted on a male masseuse, the hotel management alleged.  After receiving the service, the woman alleged attempted sexual harassment from the male staffer and reported the incident to the hotel’s Human Resources Department. The hotel management promptly informed the Police. When the Police arrived to record a statement, the tourist explained that she didn’t want to file an official complaint but planned to obtain insurance money and reimbursement for their air tickets. She sought legal documentation from a local lawyer regarding the incident. The couple also requested the hotel management not to charge any fees for the room and other obtained services until they checked out.

Addressing a media briefing at the JVP Head Office in Pelawatte, Dr. Jayatissa highlighted that while there are eight Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) accredited medical faculties in the country, an additional eight have been established by the Government affiliated with Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa and Moratuwa Universities. However, he emphasised that administrators have failed to address deficiencies, especially the Professional Units which are essential for a medical faculty, that would secure accreditation from the SLMC.  Dr. Jayatissa pointed out the absence of a teaching hospital with the necessary facilities for students in these medical faculties to receive proper training. He also noted the lack of Professional Units leading to a severe crisis for many students in these faculties. Expressing suspicions about the substandard medicine scams, Dr. Jayatissa suggested that not only the former Health Minister but also several previous health ministers might be involved.

Speaking at a media briefing in Galle, MCPA President Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa stated that these drugs were brought to the country with the assertion that they would arrive simultaneously with the questionable Immunoglobulin IV transaction. Due to the lack of quality testing, Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) filed a FR petition in the Supreme Court, resulting in an interim order suspending the inclusion of these drugs in the State healthcare system. Dr. Sanjeewa stressed, “Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella sought Cabinet approval on 25 October 2022 to utilise the Indian Credit Line or alternative funding methods for the procurement of these drugs. However, the approval was not granted.  President Ranil Wickremesinghe, as the Finance Minister also emphasised that, Treasury funds could not be utilised to import medicine under the Indian Credit Line.” “However, despite the disapproval of the Cabinet, then Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sri Chandraguptha, Additional Secretary of Medical Supplies Division (MSD) Saman Ratnayake, Deputy Director General of MSD Dr. Herath, Dr. Jayanath Buthpitiya, Chairman of the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) Sarath Liyanage and the other responsible officials carried out the procurements. Apparently, more than Rs 100 million has been paid to those suppliers despite the instructions of the President and the Cabinet,” he alleged.  Speaking further, the MCPA President said it has been revealed that a significant amount of the drugs brought to the country without quality checks through the company Savorite Pharmaceuticals (Pvt) Ltd. are on the verge of expiring.  “Several committee meetings related to these procurement processes, chaired by the former Health Minister, were held with the participation of seven officials. It is questionable as to why the former Health Minister chose to ignore the Cabinet’s instructions. He carried out the procurement without considering the instructions of the President. This amounts to a dereliction of duty. In such cases, the President has the responsibility to remove the relevant minister from Cabinet. Therefore, if there is sufficient evidence, Keheliya Rambukwella should be arrested after obtaining a statement,” he stressed.  "

The biggest wow factor is that the plants used to create the tree are grown and sent by people from all across Sri Lanka. It will go down in history as Sri Lanka’s first-ever crowd-sourced Christmas tree made of vegetable plants. Softlogic Life invited all Sri Lankans to hand over their plants and to collect these plants they travelled to Anuradhapura, Chilaw, Peradeniya, Gampaha, Kottawa, Galle and Matara in their plant collection truck in partnership with Shree FM. This unique Christmas tree was put on display on 23 December and will continue to stand tall until 2 January 2024 at the Lotus Roundabout near the Presidential Secretariat. At 30 ft tall and made up of over 2,000+ vegetable plants such as purple and green cabbage, Chinese spinach, water spinach, Malabar spinach, brinjal, bird’s eye chillies and green chillies, this tree is subject to tough environmental conditions such as intense sunlight, heat, strong winds, sea breeze and rain, located at one of the busiest roundabouts in Sri Lanka. All of this was done by Softlogic Life to send a very valuable message to Society.  In Sri Lanka, there is a famous saying: “Even if we throw a stick somewhere, it will get planted.” It’s because we are blessed with a prosperous land (soil). Sri Lanka is a truly blessed nation. This Christmas tree was created with plants from various towns in Sri Lanka which were grown under different conditions. So, if these plants could survive and thrive on a Christmas tree for over 10 days, why can’t we plant at home, even if it’s on a balcony? So, let’s start home gardening even in a small way, but in the meantime, come and see this historical Christmas tree, Sri Lanka’s first-ever crowd-sourced vegetable Christmas tree! "

Allegedly, he uploaded adult videos with his wife to a website in an attempt to generate a significant income, the Police said.  According to Police, the couple caught the attention of the neighbours due to their ‘suspicious behaviour,’ spending their time leisurely, renting vehicles without engaging in any work and ordering food and drinks online from prominent city hotels.  Following complaints from neighbours, Police searched their residence, seizing a laptop, a video camera and several other devices."

The heartwarming support, from diplomatic missions and international organisations based in Colombo, through their participation in the International Bazaar and Cultural Extravagansa 2023 organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the SLFSA in Colombo on 2 December generated nearly Rs 1.5 million in support of the LRH Neurosurgical Project. SLFSA extended its heartfelt gratitude to each diplomatic mission, which participated, for their active involvement and generous donations to this worthy cause. This is a continuation of the charity cause initiated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to celebrate ‘75 Years of Diplomacy’ through the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka (SOSL) performance in June this year.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/25/lanka-sama-samaja-party-celebrates-88th-anniversary-of-service/,Lanka Sama Samaja Party celebrates 88th anniversary of service,By Prof. Tissa Vitarana ,0,2023-12-24T20:31:00+00:00,"The Sama Samaja Party decided to mark its 88th Anniversary in the Kalutara District in response to the request of the party members of that district. A long procession started at 1:00 p.m. from the LSSP office in Matugama and passed through the streets and filled the Town Hall and the surrounding area. The meeting started at 1.30 p.m. and was chaired by Taneesha Samaraweera, the Kalutara District Organiser of the LSSP. After her welcome address, speeches were made by Tissa Vitarana, then the LSSP Deputy Secretary and President of the Youth Organisation Ravindra, the Chairman of the National Organisation of the Disabled Thushara Sampath, Acting Professor of Economics of the Colombo University Inderjit Aponso and the Jaffna District LSSP Organiser Weerakumaran among others. The presence of the Cuban Ambassador Garrido was an expression of international socialist solidarity.  It was unanimously decided to contest alone as the LSSP on the ‘Key’ symbol. Since, we began coalition politics in 1964 one lesson that we have learned is that forming alliances before the election ends up with us having to sacrifice a large number of our best candidates and abandon our policies that can save the ordinary people and the country. If it is necessary to form an alliance Government the LSSP will only sign MoUs after the General Election with other progressive parties to form a progressive alliance government, provided our policies are given due place. This approach allows us to place our solutions before the people to decide whether they like or dislike our options. If they like our options we can persuade our alliance partners to include them in the common manifesto when we sign an MOU after the election. The Lanka Sama Samaja Party [LSSP] was formed on 18 December 1935 with two main objectives, winning independence from British imperial rule and eliminating poverty and gaining social equity for all the people of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). There was a list of 22 other issues like a free health service, free education, employees rights etc. The struggle for independence led to the banning of the LSSP and the imprisonment of its leaders like Dr. N.M. Perera, Dr. Colvin R. de Silva, Philip Gunewardena and many others, both in Sri Lanka, and in India where they went to after escaping from jail. Leslie Goonewardene led the underground struggle against the British, who finally granted us independence in 1948 and they left, but retained control of the plantations, and the Queen of Britain retained sovereignty. Full independence with sovereignty was obtained after 24 years of struggle led by the LSSP (as the local capitalist class and the feudalists were satisfied with Dominion status). It was only in 1972, through the Republican Constitution drawn up by Colvin, which made Sri Lanka a fully independent and sovereign Republic. (India won independence in just 3 years through struggles led by Gandhi and Nehru, with the full support of their capitalist class. It was Colvin, as Minister of Plantations, with the support of Kobbekaduwa, who nationalised the plantations, thereby getting full control of our economy. It was the LSSP that formed most of the trade unions that struggled and won workers’ rights and fair wages. They had to have frequent strikes to support these struggles for rights and proper wages. The strength of the trade unions gave the LSSP the necessary support for the political struggles. The unions were also the recruiting grounds for new party members. But a bulk of the members came from different districts. The party was started in the Kegalle District by Dr. N.M. Perera, and while the party has 270 branches in all 25 districts, Kegalle is its stronghold. As such the Ruwanwella and Yatiyantota electorates are the strongest and the LSSP has won seats at all levels up to Parliament at every election. Deraniyagala has been lost only once. Yatiyantota came to be called “the NM electorate”.  The next in strength for the LSSP is the Southern coastal strip extending from Colombo to Galle districts, with representatives up to Parliament including Moratuwa, Panadura, Kalutara, Balapitiya, Ambalangoda and Ratgama. Extending inland from this area the LSSP has won Matugama, Agalawatte and Bandaragama. In Colombo, too LSSP had MPs from Colombo South (like Bernard Soysa), Colombo North (Vivienne Gunewardena), Colombo East and Borella. There were MPs from Badulla, Bandarawela, Nuwara Eliya and Maskeliya in the Hill Country. There were Tamil MPs from Jaffna in the North and from Batticaloa District. The LSSP is free of any prejudice based on race, religion or caste. All these MPs, MMCs etc., have worked day and night for the people they represented. Not one of them has ever had any charges of misdeeds lodged against them in any Court of Law. None have obtained or misused any Government money or buildings. Rather than using Government property or funds for themselves or relatives or friends, they have spent their own money to help others in need. They have never charged a cent for any services rendered by them. This is a proud record that has been upheld by all LSSP politicians. We are committed to serving the people and the country. You can rely on us at all times. About the author: Professor Tissa Vitarana is the Leader of the LSSP."

A Hospital ETU required an X-Ray machine and therefore urgent action should be taken to repair this piece of technology as it would only impact patient care, he added.  Fielding questions the GRTA president said, when taking a total count, currently several machines used in carrying out medical tests were out of order in several major State Hospitals. The Catheterisation labs in both National Hospitals Colombo and Kandy were non-functional.  While an MRI machine at the National Hospital Colombo has been out of order for the past several weeks. The MRI machine at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Children’s’ Hospital in Kandy needed to be replaced as it has been out of order for the past three years. He said, the young children were being either transferred to Lady Ridgeway Hospital Colombo for their MRI tests or were compelled to have their tests done in the private sector. Dharmawickrema lamented that the CT machine at Teaching Hospital Kalutara was also out of order."

In a statement, the trade unions expressed concern over the government’s ongoing efforts to privatise public enterprises and assets. The joint discussions, scheduled to commence next week, aim to tackle the challenges posed by the impending privatisation processes affecting multiple sectors. The collaborative effort, involving diverse trade unions, seeks to establish agreements tailored to the specific needs of each sector. To facilitate this dialogue, trade union leaders have been invited to a crucial meeting on 28 December 2023, at the Postal Auditorium. Several sectors, such as electricity, banking, insurance, telecom and postal services, have already endorsed these discussions. In recent weeks, strikes have been staged by unions representing postal and telecom workers, with the latter continuing its protest action last week. The invitation, jointly extended by various trade unions, highlights the adverse impact of State enterprise privatisation on a significant number of citizens, potentially excluding them from the national market. Concerns have also been raised about the negative changes in working conditions for employees in these enterprises. The trade unions stressed the absence of electoral mandates for privatisation measures in recent elections, noting that neither the current government nor its predecessor sought a mandate for this integration process.  Implementing recommendations based solely on the demands of international institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), without public consensus or formal stakeholder consultations, contradicts democratic principles and undermines the sovereignty of the people and the nation, they argued. While acknowledging potential differing views on privatisation within the country, the trade unions collectively advocate for a unified and serious opposition to such a significant change. They emphasise the need for a democratic and consultative approach in the discussions to ensure that the concerns of all stakeholders are adequately addressed. (MD)"

It was chaired by MP Gamini Lokuge. Discussions at the meeting also centered on reimbursing depositors who had placed their money in cooperative banks. The committee recommended seeking assistance from the Sanasa Federation and the Homagama Cooperative Society to address the financial challenges faced by the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Cooperative Society. Additionally, after several meetings, the committee identified four primary reasons for the collapse of cooperative businesses. These reasons include the impact of the economic crisis in the country, fraud and corruption in cooperative societies, imprudent decisions by officials, and failure to conduct accounting audits within the appropriate time frame. The meeting addressed a Bill proposed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and two other reports concerning cooperative businesses. Consequently, a sub-committee was formed, comprising officials from all Provincial Councils and relevant stakeholders, to consolidate these three reports into one comprehensive document for the improvement of cooperative businesses.

The legislation, unilaterally drafted by the government and presented in Parliament on 3 October, contained provisions that could have severely restricted users’ freedom of expression and privacy rights. Despite a review by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, which largely affirmed the government’s proposals, the GNI contended that the Court did not adequately address human rights concerns. The organisation appreciated recent indications from government officials about conducting further consultations with industry and civil society stakeholders and urged the government to ensure that these consultations were open, transparent and inclusive. The GNI highlighted several alarming clauses in the draft bill, particularly in parts one and two, which centralised power through an Online Safety Commission appointed by the President. The lack of clear safeguards for the Commission’s functions, combined with vague legal terms such as “false statements” and “prohibited statements,” raised concerns about the potential misuse of authority. The broad and unchecked powers granted to censor various content categories conflicted with the principles of necessity and proportionality, violating Sri Lanka’s international human rights obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Part three of the Bill extended speech prohibitions to users “whether in or outside Sri Lanka,” indicating extraterritorial intent, which could have led to conflicts of law and serious comity and human rights concerns. Privacy concerns also arose, particularly in Clause 29, which allowed anyone to request the identity or location disclosure of individuals who communicated a prohibited or false statement. This provision, if enforced, could have compromised individuals’ right to privacy and had been misused in other jurisdictions to target journalists, human rights defenders, and others for protected content. GNI emphasised the importance of due process, transparency, and stakeholder involvement in drafting critical legislation. To ensure compliance with international obligations and prevent disproportionate social and economic consequences, the organisation called on the government to reconsider the current proposal, extend the period for debate, and allow greater deliberation on the Supreme Court’s proposed amendments."

On Christmas day we could spend our Christmas with the poor families.”  Cardinal Ranjith appealed to the Parish Priests to bring together families living within their parishes which have been severely affected by the economic down turn in the country and provide lunch on Christmas Day. “As an Archbishop I too, would partake in Christmas lunch at a parish with 200 families which have been severely impacted by the economic situation,” he pledged.  “Not only Christians but, even those belonging to the other religions could share a meal with those less fortunate.   He said, according to a report issued recently, a four-member family required at least Rs 120,000 per month to have three meals per day. A common man receives a wage of about Rs 70,000 to 80,000 per month. But, a majority of the people receive even less than that. It has become a challenge to balance monthly expenses for many. The utility bills that have to be met, expenses for gas etc, have pushed people into borrowing – a “debt economy” is emerging at the family level, he lamented.  It has prompted professionals to leave the country as the income they receive is inadequate to pay income taxes. Doctors, accountants, technologists have all left the island, Cardinal Ranjith observed. “What we should remember as Christians is to spend Christmas without unwanted wasteful expenditure. Spend your Christmas in a manner which would not insult the economically downtrodden,” he invited. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/22/onion-prices-skyrocket-after-india-bans-exports/,ONION PRICES SKYROCKET AFTER INDIA BANS EXPORTS,Author not found,0,2023-12-21T20:31:00+00:00,"India’s ban on the export of onions has driven up prices of the vegetable for Asian buyers, who are scrambling for cheaper alternatives, particularly as New Delhi is unlikely to lift the curbs before general elections next year. Since India’s ban, onion prices have nearly doubled in Sri Lanka, which is slowly emerging from its worst financial crisis in nearly seven decades. The world’s biggest exporter of onions banned shipments on 8 December after domestic prices more than doubled in three months following a drop in production. Now retail shoppers from Kathmandu to Colombo are struggling with high prices, since traditional Asian buyers, such as Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nepal and even the United Arab Emirates, rely on imports from India to bridge domestic gaps. “Onions are needed for almost everything we cook,” said Mousumi Akhtar, who works in the private sector in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. “This sudden price hike is tough to swallow. I’ve had to cut back on how much I buy.” From the belacan shrimp paste of Malaysia and Bangladeshi biryani to chicken chillies in Nepal or Sri Lankan fish curry, Asian consumers have built up a serious dependence on Indian supplies of onions to lend spice to their favourite dishes. Traders estimate that India accounts for more than half of all imports of onions by Asian countries. Its shorter shipment times against those from rival exporters such as China or Egypt, are key to preserving the taste of the perishable commodity. India exported a record 2.5 million metric tons of onions in the financial year that ended on 31 March, with 671,125 tons going to neighbouring Bangladesh, its biggest buyer of the vegetable. To overcome the shortage, Bangladesh is trying to source more from China, Egypt and Turkey, said Commerce Ministry official Tapan Kanti Ghosh. As general elections approach next month in Bangladesh, the government has begun selling onions at subsidised prices to the poor, hoping to offset a surge of more than 50% in prices after India’s ban. Even worse is the situation in landlocked Nepal, which imports most of its onions. “Since the ban by India, we have monitored the supply situation at different places. There are no onions on sale,” said Tirtharaj Chiluwal, an official of the Himalayan nation’s Commerce Ministry. Nepal is considering imports from China and may ask India to make an exception and allow exports, said ministry spokesperson Gajendra Kumar Thakur. Importing nations have to contend with more expensive supplies from China, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey, which have all hiked prices since India is out of the market, said Ajit Shah, an Indian exporter. All would run out of supplies if India’s ban lasted for an extended period, said one exporter based in Mumbai, the financial capital. Within a week after the ban, onions became 20% cheaper in India as supplies from the new season’s crop came in, traders said. Now, with domestic supplies more than adequate to satisfy demand at home, Shah, the exporter, said India should allow exports to maintain its global market position. But the curbs are unlikely to go before next year’s general elections, as the priority of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is to hold down food prices, the Mumbai-based exporter said. New Delhi has also reined in exports of rice, sugar and wheat. Malaysia, like other importers, is also trying to secure supplies from China and Pakistan, said Seri Mohamad Sabu, its Agriculture Minister. (Reuters)"

However, he clarified that the party is presently evaluating four potential candidates including Dhammika Perera for the presidential race and will eventually endorse the most suitable contender for electoral success. Kariyawasam said Dhammika Perera is one of the considered candidates, having expressed a desire to run for President. However, he emphasised that the final decision on the party’s presidential candidate is yet to be made, and the party’s Central Committee will reveal this information at the right time. Addressing a media briefing, Kariyawasam announced that his party does not universally endorse certain decisions made by the President and the Government. He expressed concern over the escalating financial burden on the country’s citizens, attributing it to the anticipated rise in prices due to the recently introduced Value Added Tax (VAT). Kariyawasam emphasised that the party did not anticipate such economic challenges. He lamented the perceived disparity between the promises made during Mahinda Rajapaksa’s leadership and the present reality, deeming it an unfortunate situation. Despite not aligning completely with the Government’s actions, he stressed the importance of avoiding embarrassment and anarchy by supporting the Government in Parliament."

Due to its rapidly increasing spread, WHO is classifying JN.1 as a separate variant of interest (VOI) from the parent lineage BA.2.86.

Three years on since 50,000 employees were recruited as Development Officers. But there are thousands of households in various regions whose assessments have not been collected as yet. If we had acted with discretion and forethought such a situation would not have arisen. This cannot happen when we have a group of officials employed in this field. The mechanism which runs from the Grama Niladhari  level to District Secretary can play a pivotal role to transform the economy to a better standard. With the economic crisis, the Government had to limit filling vacancies in the public service. Likewise, currently there are around 3,000 vacancies for Grama Niladhari Officers who are the main State officers who handle the public service at village level. After conducting examinations to recruit a set of officers to this grade, we will commence recruitment.  We expect to overcome the existing issues and provide a people-friendly public service through this procedure”, the Premier said.  Ministers Harin Fernando, Nalin Fernando, MP Sahan Pradeep and Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration Ranjith Ashoka participated in this event."

Sooriyarajah said yesterday (20) that a total of 1,116 families, comprising 3,749 members, have been affected by adverse weather in the Jaffna District. Sooriyarajah said 28 families, with 91 members, evacuated from their residences in the Chavakachcheri Divisional Secretariat (DS) division, are presently housed in an emergency shelter in the same division. Chankanai DS Division reported the highest number of affected families, with 343 families comprising 1,245 members affected, according to Sooriyarajah. The Assistant Director highlighted that many displaced families, unwilling to stay in emergency shelters, are presently staying with friends and relatives until floodwaters recede. He reported that 32 houses in the district were partially damaged, and compensation would be provided after assessing the extent of the damage. Despite heavy rain leading to a decline in student attendance, the DMC has not been formally informed about school closures. Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department said the prevailing showers will continue the following day. Meteorologist Shanika Dissanayake said several spells of showers are expected in Northern, Eastern, Matale and Polonnaruwa districts on 21 December. Additionally, showers or thundershowers are likely in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and Galle, Matara, Kandy and Nuwara Eliya districts after 2:00 p.m. Misty conditions were expected in the morning at certain locations in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Southern provinces, according to Meteorologist Jayakody. The public was advised to exercise caution and take precautionary measures to protect themselves from temporary localised strong winds and lightning during thundershowers, Dissanayake added. With inclement weather persisting islandwide, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) issued landslide early warning alerts at various levels to 51 Divisional Secretariat (DS) divisions and surrounding areas in 12 districts. Senior Scientist of the Landslide Early Warning Centre of NBRO, Dr. K.G.P.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

The designated funds were not utilised for their intended purpose, resulting in the absence of a reserve of buffer rice stocks in Sri Lanka. The Ministry had set a target of maintaining a safe rice reserve of 8,000 MT, which, unfortunately, has not been achieved, he said.  Cabinet approval was granted to provide Rs 300 million in 2020, Rs 200 million in 2021 and Rs 50 million in 2022 for the maintenance of a buffer rice stock reserve to be used in the event of a disaster. Despite these allocations, the deficiency in proper buffer rice stocks poses a significant problem for the country. The official attributed this issue to the failure of the Food Commissioner’s Office to fulfil its responsibilities despite annual Government allocations. Highlighting the lack of proper supervision, the official emphasised that had the ministry exercised proper oversight, the country would not face this shortage of safe rice stocks. The non-implementation of recommendations from the National Audit Office’s reports regarding the ministry’s supervisory functions has exacerbated the situation. Mudith Perera, President of the United Rice Producers’ Association, acknowledged these concerns, noting that the Food Commissioner’s Department has not maintained sufficient stocks of buffer rice for use in case of shortages. He alleged that existing rice stocks are being illegally sold to the private sector with the knowledge of the Chief Accountant of the Food Commissioner’s Department, prompting a complaint to the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) in 2021."

Ratnayaka said this during the International Migrants Day event at the President’s Office on Monday (18). He highlighted the importance of engaging with the diaspora and creating an environment that encourages their return and investment. Any Sri Lankan residing in another country, regardless of ethnicity or religion, is considered part of the diaspora. Historical events have created a disconnect between the country and its overseas citizens, he said, pointing out the challenges faced by diaspora members who desire to contribute to Sri Lanka’s development but encounter bureaucratic obstacles. During the event, Ratnayaka inaugurated the official website (https://oosla.lk/) for the Office of Overseas Sri Lankan Affairs. Professor Lakshman Samaranayake delivered the keynote address, and in recognition of the exemplary services of the Office of Sri Lankan Affairs Abroad, Ratnayaka, along with Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, presented Professor Samaranayake with a commemorative memento. He said establishing the Office for Overseas Sri Lankan Affairs (OOSLA) aligns with broader economic reform processes in Sri Lanka. He highlighted the need for transparency, a level playing field and attractiveness to make Sri Lanka an appealing place for investment, encouraging Sri Lankans living abroad to invest in the country. OOSLA was established with the overarching goal of engaging with the entire Sri Lankan diaspora. It aims to assist Sri Lankans living abroad with issues such as dual citizenship, passport renewals and obtaining information about their relatives, fostering their contribution to the country’s development. Foreign Minister Sabry also addressed the significance of International Migrants Day, emphasising the challenges and opportunities associated with migration. He stressed the proactive engagement of Sri Lanka with its diaspora, both permanent migrants and temporary workers abroad. He highlighted the historical ties with migration and the need to create conditions that encourage the diaspora to return to their homeland. The Foreign Minister recognised the contributions of Sri Lankan migrants, emphasising the importance of providing them with respect, dignity, and a sense of belonging, in line with constitutional principles. He discussed the establishment of OOSLA as a significant step toward addressing the concerns and needs of the diaspora. Minister Sabry announced the approval of a new law establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission with extensive powers, aiming to provide reparations, locate missing persons and initiate prosecutions. He sees this as a positive step toward creating a conducive environment for fair living in the country. The Minister also highlighted efforts to modernise services for expatriates, aiming to make all services, including immigration-related processes, accessible online. This move intends to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and facilitate smoother interactions for Sri Lankans living abroad. During the gathering, Director General of OOSLA, V. Krishnamurthy, highlighted that the office commenced operations in January 2023 in line with President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s vision. He emphasised the significance of 18 December as the opportune day to introduce the institution to the global Sri Lankan community. Krishnamurthy noted that the diaspora, numbering close to 3 million Sri Lankans who have relocated abroad for diverse reasons, has significantly influenced and contributed to the country’s economy. This acknowledgement underscores the profound impact and positive role played by this expatriate community during the preceding period. The event saw participation, including Ambassadors, High Commissioners and Secretaries of Ministries representing foreign countries. Additionally, several Sri Lankans residing abroad engaged in the proceedings online."

According to the Ministry, this decision aims to curb the docking of Chinese ‘research-cum-spy’ ships at Sri Lankan ports.  The Government is contemplating this moratorium to mitigate diplomatic tensions, especially during the upcoming election year in 2024, as visits by such ships can create disruptions in the region.  China’s request to dock its marine scientific research vessel, the Xiang Yang Hong 3, has been met with reservations from New Delhi, influencing Sri Lanka’s decision. Sri Lanka’s stance is seen as a diplomatic balancing act, avoiding favouritism towards either China or India in the run-up to the 2024 Presidential Elections. During the next 12 months, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to enhance its marine research capabilities, positioning itself as an equal partner in future foreign research expeditions. The objective is to engage in research activities on equal terms with other nations. In October of the present year, Sri Lanka permitted the docking and operations of a Chinese survey and research vessel, Shi Yan 6, at one of its ports. However, the Sri Lankan Government’s move to impose a moratorium reflects a cautious approach, considering the geopolitical sensitivities involved. China’s utilisation of research vessels, often labelled as spy ships, has raised concerns about data collection on strategic assets in Southern India and exploration of ecological and mineral resources in the Gulf of Mannar.

The Sri Lankan Catholic Church had been upset to hear information from reliable sources that Sabry was to be appointed as Justice Minister, he claimed.   “But it is not by considering his ethnicity, his caste or creed. It was because of the atmosphere that prevailed at the time when Cabinet Portfolios were being given. However, we had no concerns when he was appointed the Minister of Foreign Affairs,” Cardinal Ranjith said.  Meanwhile, the Archbishop said his lawyers had been able to finish studying a large portion of the Easter Sunday Commission Report handed over to the Catholic Bishops’ Conference by Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles earlier.      “But we are going through it to see if facts and sections were missing,” he said. The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report has specifically mentioned that they did not have adequate time to analyse certain facts. The PCoI also lamented that they had not had the authority to bring down those who had fled the country following the Easter Attacks to question them. There were also claims that certain officials had intervened and prevented certain parties from giving evidence. This shows that even the Commission had been influenced by certain politicians with vested interests.  Cardinal Ranjith said recommendations had been made to outline steps which needed to be taken to promote peace and harmony amongst different ethnic groups in the country. Also, it notes that some of the officials had failed to carry out their duties and recommendations had been given to the Government to take disciplinary and legal action against those officials. However, none of this has been done. Unfortunately, the Government was not even able to implement the LLRC Report. The only thing that happened was that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had been seen on television in an armchair reading the LLRC report and making claims that he was going to implement what was in it.  How many of these recommendations that have been given by various PCoIs implemented by the various governments?, he queried. There were commissions appointed to probe the Bond Scam, but no action was taken against those found guilty of having been a part of it. Spokesman for the Colombo Archbishop’s House, Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando said he was unable to give a percentage of the number of pages that had been completed.  The Cardinal’s lawyers were still assessing the Presidential Commission Report on the 2019 Easter Attacks which has 40,000 pages. “Recommendations have been made by the Commission after they themselves analysed it.

Perera,0,2023-12-19T20:33:00+00:00,"National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader, MP Wimal Weerawansa, took a swipe at US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, claiming that she issued him a Letter of Demand (LOD) regarding the content of his book on the Aragalaya protests last year and if the matter goes to Court, he will reiterate the same contents without hesitation. These remarks were made during the ‘After 9th: Sri Lanka’s Destiny?’ event organised by the NFF United Kingdom Committee in London on Sunday (17). MP Weerawansa queried why individuals who gathered at Galle Face last year, claiming that the country was in trouble, are now silent. He asserted that the perceived issues have subsided since the appointment of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The MP contended that the protests and opposition against the State did not arise due to the problems existing at the time but rather grew because of the influence of foreign embassies in Colombo and other foreign missions. Weerawansa alleged that foreign imperialist powers used the Aragalaya to achieve their objectives by ousting the then government. He alleged that Ambassador Chung was one of the “masterminds” behind the Aragalaya. According to Weerawansa, the absence of street protests now is attributed to Julie Chung being content with the present situation in the country. He further alleged that social media influencers and activists, who were prominent during the social uprising in Sri Lanka last year, are now engaged in celebratory activities. Weerawansa asserted that the Aragalaya was not about the people’s issues but centred on Ambassador Chung’s agenda. He claimed that these influencers and activists only act when issues align with Ambassador Chung’s agenda and remain inactive when it doesn’t. Additionally, Weerawansa contended that many political parties and offices of politicians have been infiltrated by agents working with imperialist embassies. He warned that Sri Lanka, like Ukraine and Palestine, is at risk of becoming a geopolitical battleground shortly. He alleged that suspected Western imperialist powers will employ a strategy similar to the Aragalaya during the upcoming election year in Sri Lanka to achieve their goals."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The people of the country will regain confidence in the State health service.  Or else this country will never be able to develop or eliminate fraud and corruption, he warned. Dharmawickrama alleged that the technical thefts that occurred in the Health Ministry were done by preparing a conducive environment for it. The end users of the technologies were not involved in the technical evaluation committees in the procurement activities that were often done. He lamented that as a result some of the machinery that had been purchased could not be used or had already been removed from use. They filled their pockets by pilfering State funds. He alleged that the former Health Ministry Secretary had been caught because he had been unable to play this game properly. As a result of this incident, some people claim that no one was suitable for the Health Ministry Secretary’s post other than a doctor. They claimed that even administrative officers were not suitable for the position.  The GRTA President said health trade unions had uncovered incidents of corruption only to have disciplinary action taken against those who revealed such details. “We exposed the fraudulent acts and corruption taking place in the Ministry and called for investigations into them,” he said, urging the Government and the new Health Minister to immediately launch investigations into other fraud and corruption committed in the past."

This was observed by the Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on Children, Women and Gender, which met recently in Parliament. Meanwhile, a report is to be submitted to Parliament regarding the issues and recommendations related to the safety and care of children between the ages of 0-5 years, of working women in Sri Lanka and the committee examined the content in the report thoroughly.  It was discussed in the Sectoral Oversight Committee that the impact on the growing child of 0-5 years of age without mother’s care will have a huge social impact in the next 20-25 years. The Committee met in the Parliament Premises with MP Talatha Athukorala chairing session. According to Ministry Circular No. 02/2023, permission has been given for mothers with children aged 02 and above to go abroad, thereby the child loses the ability to receive breast milk and the bond between mother and child is also lost, the committee emphasised. Furthermore, it was discussed that the loss of the mother from a young age is likely to result in a very violent generation in the future and because the children are deprived of care from a young age due to the mother moving abroad and there is a tendency for those children to be involved in drugs and other criminal activities in the future.  It was also discussed that since children are under someone else’s care, they can be molested not only by neighbours, but also by close relatives such as fathers and grandfathers. It was emphasised that there is a strong need for day-care centres that operate based on safe and formal recommendations for children in early childhood.   It was further discussed that there is no specific institution for the regulation and supervision of day-care centres and that day-care centres are not properly registered and the data related to day-care centres is very deficient. The committee was of the opinion that the above problems can be avoided by following the provisions of the National Guidelines for Child Day- Care Centres in Sri Lanka compiled and published by the National Child Protection Authority. Accordingly, it was recommended by the Sectoral Oversight Committee to regulate the quality of day-care centres in Sri Lanka and to re-enforce the law that prevented mothers with children under the age of five from leaving for foreign employment. The members of the Sectoral Oversight Committee, Muditha Prishanthi, Dullas Alahapperuma, D. Weerasinghe, Manjula Dissanayake, and with the permission of the Committee Chair, MP J. C.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer.

The yield from farmer Bandula’s half acre, which brought him this large income, is considered to be the highest from just half an acre. Under the Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project, he started chilli cultivation on half an acre in the Puliyankulama area using the new technology in chilli cultivation. In particular, MICH 1 and 2, which are the local chilli varieties that give the highest yield in the country, had been selected for this cultivation. Within nine months of starting this chilli cultivation, he has earned an income of 10 million rupees and this was informed to the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera on Sunday. The Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project has introduced high density cultivation methods and new agricultural technology for chilli cultivation. According to the traditional chilli cultivation method, only 6,000 chilli plants can be planted in half an acre, but under the high-density cultivation method, 13,000 plants can be planted. Accordingly, it is accepted to increase the yield several times. Also, by covering the beds with polythene covers and using water under the drip irrigation system, there is no wastage of water and no additional money has to be spent on weed control. Half an acre of chilli cultivation at a time requires minimum amount of chemical fertiliser. Also, because pesticides are not used to control pests, the quality of chilli cultivation also increases. Previously, two farmers who had the highest yield and income from chilli cultivation in our country were reported from the Tirappane and Jaffna areas. They earned five million and six million rupees. But, Bandula of Puliyankulama has earned an income of more than 10 million rupees by Sunday (17) and he has the ability to earn at least 13 million rupees according to the current market prices for chillies. He will be able to harvest his chillies till next January 14. In this regard, he said that by introducing new technology to chilli cultivation and other crops, the government’s goal is to provide the farmers with the opportunity to earn more income and to obtain the harvest needed by the country."

According to them it was not clear as to how many of the cases were the JN.1 sub variant as only a few samples underwent genome sequencing.  The particular sub variant was first identified in Luxembourg and is a offspring of the Pirola variant (BA.2.86) which itself was a descendant of the Omicron sub variant.

He also said these matters came to light during an investigation conducted after receiving complaints from parents about substandard pencils, colouring pencils, plastic water bottles and lunch boxes imported to Sri Lanka.  According to international standards related to plastics, usable plastics are graded as 1, 2, 4 and 5, and No. 5 plastic is suitable for water bottles and lunch boxes.   Dr. Wickramarachchi also mentioned that parents are requested to provide only plastic water bottles and lunch boxes with the No. 5 grade mentioned on the outer bottom, for the use of children.   He said unusable plastics contain Bisphenol A (BPA) which is carcinogenic, and long-term use of plastic containers containing it can cause illnesses such as catarrh, asthma and eczema.  He mentioned that plastics that do not contain this chemical are designated as usable plastic and that different numbered categories of this usable plastic have been designated to pack food and drinks under different conditions such as single-use water bottles and cold drinks.  He further said he urges people to buy quality products and not to buy substandard imported plastic equipment to save a little money in the short term. Meanwhile, due to the low quality of imported school equipment sold islandwide, the lives of schoolchildren in this country have been put at risk and the sale of substandard school equipment from countries like China is increasing rapidly at a very high profit, Chairman of the National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection, Ranjith Withanage, said.        He said any person or organisation can import and sell substandard school equipment and the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) has not introduced any standards in this regard. He mentioned that it is a common practice for small children to chew pencils/colouring pencils and due to this, there is a risk of harmful heavy metals contained in such products entering their bodies.  The Consumer Affairs Authority should set up a programme to look into this and it is very important for parents to have some idea about the quality of the school equipment when the schools issue the book lists, Withanage asserted.  He also stated that his union requests authorities to take necessary action to regulate imported school equipment. He said although teachers and trade unions of our country constantly struggle for their rights, they maintain pin-drop silence on such sensitive matters.  Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) Secretary, Joseph Stalin, said there is a very big problem regarding the health and safety of children and the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) has a responsibility to find out and confirm the quality of these products. He said the SLSI is forsaking its duty and he plans to investigate the substandard equipment and take legal action against it.  Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said due to the economic situation in the country, people tend to buy goods from the cheapest place and urged parents to be mindful about child safety when making purchases. He further said if there is substandard school equipment, the provincial education authorities have been informed to take action in this regard and they have also been instructed to inform the schools in this connection."

Former Health Secretary had allegedly recommended the manufacturer of fake immunoglobulin Isolez Pharma AG to manufacture three more medicinal drugs.  “It’s the misfortune of the entire country that parties who were directly responsible to order the manufacture of fake drugs to go scot-free? Is the question posed by the public.   The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) earlier said a batch of human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) imported to Sri Lanka from India in violation of the due procedure was suspended from use. Forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance when importing the drug which later failed the quality tests. The product, manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd.

Additionally, the Upcountry programme, aimed at supporting isolated mountain villages, has commenced, with each divisional secretariat receiving Rs 10 million. Plans are in place to incrementally increase this support,” he said. “Financial allocations to provincial councils will contribute to the overall funding available to each district. Capital expenditure at the ministry level, along with foreign aid-supported projects, will be integrated into the funding structure. President Wickremesinghe highlighted that this comprehensive approach, combining resources from various channels, aims to commence the work by July 2024,” he added. President Wickremesinghe expressed plans to establish committees at provincial level, collaborating with district development committees. These committees, comprising district chairpersons, members and officers, will oversee development activities in their respective divisional secretariats. Provincial Council projects will be initiated through the Governor, while Central Government projects will be managed by relevant institutions."

The Minister expressed these views at a special programme organised to educate community Police committees in Matara on Saturday (16).  The Minister said, “We took up this ministerial responsibility about one-and-a-half years ago, at a time when the whole country was faced with many challenges. Due to daily protests and the various gamas being set up, no foreigner set foot into the country. Business activities were paralysed. Many institutions had to be closed for a long time and many did not get a proper wage. We were assigned the challenge of restoring the country that was in such a grave situation. Meanwhile, there was a change in the leadership of the country. In the discussions held with the current President, it was also expressed that the President would give his utmost support to curb the prevailing situation. Without the support of the President, it will not be possible to carry out any of these tasks”. “The main challenge assigned to us was to change the prevailing situation in the country. With the support of the current acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) , who was a Senior DIG at that time, we removed the ‘Gama’ which was known by various names in Colombo, bringing normalcy to people’s lives. As a result, there was a big change in the country. However, the ‘struggle’ that existed at that time led to many problems in the country which prevails even today. At that time, the police had to focus on protesters and demonstrations and had no time to focus on drugs, the underworld and other criminal activities that was going on in the country. This resulted in drug usage spiking and more and more drug addicts in addition to underworld activities. At that time, the police was badly treated badly. When one dons a police uniform, you don’t have to surrender to anyone. I instructed police officers to perform their duties fearlessly. I also said I would stand up for them as the Minister in charge in the event any issue cropped up. This rang true and the police force turned out to be fearless in any calamity and perform their duties better. In such a setup, the IGP and I had to face brickbats on social media. Some believed that through this they would be able to discourage us and block this programme. Those who criticised us were in the belief that these brickbats would deter us in our duty and to create an opinion that it was in my interest as minister to appoint the current Acting IGP. I believed that the latter was the most suitable officer to solve criminal activities in Colombo and then solve those in other parts of the country and that he had the ability to do so. “I don’t have any personal interest other than implementing the programme needed for the country. A large number of people, including some religious leaders and lawyers, followed these protests. On investigation it was found that many famous lawyers who opposed the appointment of the Acting IGP were found to be lawyers representing drug traffickers and were in their pay. Looking at it from this perspective, it could be seen as to why they were vehemently opposed to his appointment as acting IGP and the real agenda behind this. We desperately need to get rid of drug dealers and the underworld, in this scenario, the Police are all out to implement an effective programme. “We have already drawn up a programme that is to be implemented. The acting IGP and the Commander of the Special Task Force have been instructed as to how it should be carried out. Meanwhile, a special programme is being implemented by the police and the Navy to deal with large scale drug smugglers who bring drugs to Sri Lanka. Our focus is to dismantle the drug trafficking network. Once the drug distribution network is dismantled, the drug import business will be disrupted and drug users will not be able to gain access to drugs. We will certainly fulfill this task. “Previously, when a drug dealer is arrested, some person in power would pressure the police and they are released. But as long as I hold this position, there is no remote chance of such a thing happening. We will not be influenced by anyone, whatever rank he may hold. We need the support of community police committees and the public for that. The public should support the police to overcome this menace. People have an understanding as to how drug trafficking works in every area. As such the police need that information. Previously, when people gave information to the police, there was uncertainty about their safety. But under this programme such informants need not entertain any such fear. “People are requested to divulge information without any fear. If we all join hands, it is not impossible to eradicate crime including drug trafficking. Underworld activities are spiking due to drug use and traffickers. Women and children have to face various harassments. From January, a 24-hour hotline will be introduced where women police officers will report such activities. “During the terrorist war, the public cooperated with the police and the armed forces. Now too we are facing a similar challenge. However, not limited to the story, this programme is being implemented practically all over the country. It is necessary for the public to provide information for each operation. We are checking every bit of information we receive. We are working to strictly implement the law. “The people involved in drug sales are also requested to think about their children and family and not contribute to the downfall of other families. The police will not ignore such activities. The same applies to those hiding illegal weapons. The police have to use these weapons before it is used against them or used for any other crime. These operations are ongoing. All those who love their children, brothers, sisters and family are requested to support this operation.” The Maha Sangha, Ministry Secretary Vyani Gunathilaka, acting IGP Deshbandu Tennakoon, Senior DIG in charge of Special Task Force, Senior DIG in charge of the Southern Province, Police Chiefs, government officials, community police committee representatives and a large number of people attended the event."

He was instrumental in realising several crowning achievements in India-Sri Lanka ties.  Among the key highlights of his term was the multi-pronged assistance worth USD 4 billion, in response to the economic challenges in Sri Lanka in 2022. The signing of the Modalities Agreement for the possession, development and use of Trincomalee Tank Farms and Joint Venture between CPC & LIOC in January 2022 also deserves a special mention. Under his watch, India supplied more than 25 tons of medicines, Made in India Covid vaccines, Rapid Antigen Test kits, Liquid Medical Oxygen, to Sri Lanka to tide over the Covid-19 pandemic. Further, Indian Naval and Air Force assets were deployed specially to expedite humanitarian supplies to Sri Lanka during this period.  The economic and commercial engagement between the two countries got a major boost during his tenure. There have been multiple bilateral MoUs including for cooperation in renewable energy, for intergrid connection, for the development of Trincomalee, for UPI-application acceptance & digital payments, utilisation of INR- denominated trade settlements. India has also emerged to be the largest trading partner of Sri Lanka. While development partnership featured landmark projects such as the Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity Project, generational linkages in Buddhism were reinforced through numerous noble initiatives such as the USD 15 million grant assistance for the promotion of Buddhist ties, inaugural international flight from Sri Lanka to the sacred city of Kushinagar in October 2021, carrying almost 100 monks. Various dimensions of connectivity also deepened such as the resumption of Chennai-Jaffna flights and recommencement of ferry services. Santosh Jha will assume charge as the next Indian High Commissioner. Jha is presently serving as India’s Ambassador to Belgium, Luxembourg and the European Union. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Jha has served in diverse capacities in several countries and New Delhi including as a Counsellor at the Indian High Commission, Colombo during 2007-2010. "

He emphasised that those opposing the programme should provide concrete proposals to rescue the country from financial crisis. The President cautioned against engaging in rhetoric merely for public appeasement without shouldering responsibilities, noting that such political tactics could lead the nation back into economic turmoil. The President underscored that, despite facing blame and acknowledging the challenge of making tough decisions, individuals resorting to popular statements exhibit an unwillingness to take necessary measures. Emphasising the absence of alternative options to salvage the country’s economy, he reiterated the initiation of the programme with the IMF. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks while participating in the inauguration of the Karaliya Conference and Performing Arts Centre at the Kandy Municipality this morning (17). The construction of the Performing Arts Centre by the Kandy Municipal Council commenced in 2018, with an expenditure of nearly Rs 600 million from the Municipal Council Fund. The establishment of this Conference and Performing Arts Centre aims to address the city’s infrastructure gap by providing auditorium facilities and creating exhibition halls for art and sculpture. The President inaugurated the building complex by unveiling the commemorative plaque. President Ranil Wickremesinghe awarded certificates of appreciation to individuals and businesses for their outstanding contributions to the  Pivithuru Dorakada business contribution programme and the city beautification programme. These initiatives were collaboratively implemented by the Urban Development Authority and the Kandy Municipality under the Kandy Formal City Development Programme aiming to enhance and preserve the distinctive features of the world heritage buildings in the city of Kandy.  Additionally, a special souvenir was presented to the President during the ceremony. President  Wickremesinghe, addressing the gathering, emphasised that the construction of the new Karaliya theatre signifies a modern architectural model for the city of Kandy in the 21st century. Highlighting the cultural significance of such structures, he expressed that the city, deeply rooted in history, plays a crucial role in the cultural and tourism industries of the country. “The newly established centre has the capacity to host conferences and events, thereby elevating the significance of Kandy city. The President expressed the intention to enhance Kandy’s cultural infrastructure by introducing a modern library. Plans are underway to construct a three or four-story library building as part of the Bogambara programme. The relocation of the D.S. Senanayake Library to this new facility is expected, enabling the integration of the library with the theatre building. This transformation aims to create a facility comparable to the Bandaranaike Conference Hall. “President Wickremesinghe expressed plans to initiate the Kandy development programme in the coming year. Additionally, a multimodal transport centre is slated to commence construction next year in Kandy. The President emphasised the need to upgrade infrastructure on Gopallawa Mawatha, advocating for the replacement of single-story houses with at least three-storied structures. These endeavours are projected to be completed within the next five years. “A modern Kandy city is set to take shape, with the commencement of the first phase scheduled for the upcoming month. Although previously initiated, progress on these projects had been impeded by the economic crisis afflicting the nation. The President highlighted that the stagnation resulting from the country’s financial distress had obstructed the momentum of crucial development initiatives. “Following the country’s descent into bankruptcy, the administration had to engage with two distinct groups. Several nations extended loans, including India, China, Japan and entities associated with the Paris Club. While India and other organizations participated in discussions within the framework of the Paris Club concerning these loans, separate negotiations were held with China. The President highlighted that, akin to Sri Lanka, other nations grappling with bankruptcy also confronted similarly challenging circumstances. “Divided into three distinct groups—India on the one side, the Paris Club on the other and China forming the third—the Government initiated dialogues with each, facilitated by the Lazard team. The negotiations adhered to the terms set by the IMF. In a significant milestone, the administration successfully secured the initial agreement with the IMF and devised a debt restructuring plan that garnered acceptance from India, China and the Paris Club. Consequently, the first instalment of the loan, as stipulated by the IMF, has been received. “Engaging in a series of diplomatic dialogues, the President  held discussions with the Secretary of the Treasury in the United States. Following this, deliberations were conducted with the President, Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Japan. Subsequently, meetings were held with the Finance Minister and the Prime Minister of India. A visit to China ensued, during which discussions were conducted with the President and Finance Minister of China. “Negotiations were held with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which serves as an aid organization. However, there is a notable absence of similar aid organizations in China. Despite this, negotiations were successfully conducted with China’s Exim Bank, culminating in the challenging acquisition of the loan agreement. “Examining the situation in Zambia, it is evident that they remain entangled in a predicament. The absence of consensus on credit review has emerged as a significant impediment for them. “Our next step involves heading to London to engage in negotiations with private creditors. Successfully emerging from bankruptcy has paved the way for us to regain access to credit, facilitating the commencement of development initiatives in the near future. The upcoming year will witness a surge in development projects, marking a significant milestone achieved through agreements pertaining to loans from the IMF and other nations. “We find ourselves in the position of demonstrating a minimum income to meet our country’s debt obligations. Despite the challenges, we have committed to moving forward. Our primary objective is to increase the GDP by 10.4%, a target initially. The target set for 2024 may not be achievable; however, there is an expectation to reach this goal by 2025 or 2026. Recognising the need for flexibility, we engaged in negotiations with the IMF to revise the target to 9.2% for 2024. Although they indicated reluctance to further adjustments, our determination is unwavering and we are poised to achieve this revised goal. “If you were in my position, facing the dilemma of extending the timeline or achieving these goals by 2024, what would you choose? I firmly asserted that expediting these accomplishments is the priority. Meeting the 2024 goal will leave us with a deficit of 534 billion in our income—a challenge we are steadfastly working to address. “The shortage we face is partly attributed to the Aswasuma project. We invested Rs 61 billion in Samurdhi, but an allocation of Rs 207 billion has been earmarked for Aswasuma relief, specifically for the underprivileged citizens of our nation. Additionally, the augmentation of government employee salaries required an allocation of another Rs 133 billion. It is essential to recognise that the Rs 534 billion deficits is a result of vital investments. For three years, the country’s economy suffered a collapse without adequate capital expenditure, necessitating the infusion of funds into these crucial areas. “The IMF suggested that we should increase taxes. This presents an unbearable situation. While raising taxes may lead to a decrease in popularity, rescuing the economy is paramount to eliminating bankruptcy. Although there were options to increase various taxes, such as fuel taxes, it was identified that such measures would have widespread repercussions across multiple sectors. When accounting for the cascading impact on electricity charges, the cumulative effect of raising the fuel tax becomes significantly more burdensome. “So we focused only on Value Added Tax (VAT). The VAT, which was 15%, was increased to 18%. Also, VAT was charged on those that were not currently VAT charged. In other countries, VAT is charged on all of them. Also, in India, the VAT rate is up to 23% while Pakistan up to 18%. Their per capita income is lower than ours. “Hence, I made the difficult decision within the Cabinet. The Cabinet comprises individuals who will be seeking re-election in the next election and it is widely acknowledged that none of them favours tax increases. However, we realised that there was no alternative. The Government is steadfast in its commitment to pulling the country out of bankruptcy by 2024. Consequently, although met with reluctance, everyone in the Cabinet ultimately agreed, recognising that overcoming bankruptcy is essential for the progress of our nation. “Furthermore, what is our alternative? One option is to refrain from spending, but I find that impractical. I challenged others to propose an alternative, but no one has come forward with a viable solution. “Some experts and politicians suggest renegotiating with the IMF. However, this is a misleading proposition. The IMF is not a singular entity. We engaged in discussions with numerous countries, meeting with their leaders. Altering the terms now would mean our country must repay the debt anew. I am not in favour of such a scenario. It is crucial to ask the people if they are willing to return to bankruptcy or not. “Those opposing this should articulate alternative solutions if the programme with the IMF is rejected. It is imperative to declare how we can generate revenue and navigate our way out of bankruptcy. This reflects a significant weakness in our political landscape—unwillingness to take responsibility and make challenging decisions. Mere attempts to please without contemplating the source of funds won’t suffice. This lack of foresight was evident last May when no one stepped up to shoulder the responsibility. Hence, I urge all political leaders to act responsibly in this matter. “Central Province Governor Lalit U. Gamage expressed gratitude to the President for inaugurating the theatre building in the heart of the historic city of Kandy. He also extended appreciation to former Mayor Kesara Senanayake and the councillor group for their valuable contribution to the welfare of future generations of artistes. Notably, this theatre was erected following the unfortunate incident of the D. S. Senanayake library being destroyed by fire. “This holds immense significance for our children and the broader community, serving as a crucial space to embrace the future. The modern technology integrated into this theatre enhances the importance of Kandy city”, the President said. The event was attended by State Minister Dilum Amunugama, Members of Parliament  Rauff Hakeem, A.H.M. Halim, M. Velukumar, former Chief Minister of Central Provincial Council Sarath Ekanayake, former Mayor of Kandy Metropolitan Council Kesara Senanayake, Central Provincial Chief Secretary Ajith Premasinghe, Kandy District Secretary Chandana Thennakoon, Municipal Commissioner of Kandy Metropolitan Council Ishan Wijethilaka and an invited group."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

In his address, Abeywardena underscored the necessity of moving forward as united Sri Lankans, shedding political differences. “If we support the President’s programmes, Sri Lanka can be transformed into a developed nation in a short period,” he said. The tourism industry has collapsed over the past three years due to the Covid-19 pandemic and global economic slowdown, according to Abeywardena. “President Wickremesinghe has achieved a lot in a short span of just one and a half years, largely rescuing the country from the economic crisis.  It is his view that if we are able to bring 5 million tourists we will be able to pay off foreign debt with ease,” the UNP Chairman said."

This project was conceptualised to eradicate disparities in the manual tea-weighing system from the field weighting equipment before transporting green leaves to the respective processing centres.  With newly introduced digital scales, each tea harvester (plucker or picker) gets accurate figures from the field. After initial digital weighting, the system automatically counts tare weight deductions under dry or wet weather conditions and is connected to authorised devices, reducing the gap between the traditional system and the newly introduced system.  The digitally improved new system is expected to benefit tea pickers by easing their grievances over long-standing unethical field deductions. Thereby, each knows to extract figures after weighting on the field instead of doubtful manual weighting.  Initial projects of Hatton Plantations PLC were inaugurated at Waltrim Estate in Lindula and Dickoya Estate in Hatton in the presence of Menaka Athukorala, Executive Director of Hatton Plantations PLC. This project is to be operationalised in all estates of the company soon. This Corporate Social Responsibility event was enlivened by the kids of beneficiary families with dances. Meanwhile, the Executive Director joined them and cut a cake to mark this significant day, followed by awarding educational aids to them. “This will be highly accurate in our present agricultural practices, which can enhance your economy and morale. Old systems may have hindered your accuracy and motivation, but now all of you will be aware of the process. This accuracy will provide many benefits to you and your families, especially in economic terms,” Athukorala added in his brief address to the gathering.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/18/capacity-building-in-universities-need-of-the-hour/,Capacity-building in universities need of the hour,Author not found,0,2023-12-17T20:32:00+00:00,"A university is a higher education institute that is supposed to not just disseminate skills and education via a wide range of certificate programmes but also an institute that serves the community by conducting research, preparing students for society with career guidance and creating balanced graduates equipped with knowledge as well as cognitive skills, entrepreneurial mindsets and free thinking; much-needed to create a generation that isn’t just book-smart but a one that is also responsible, innovative and productive.  Although the fundamental purpose of a university doesn’t change with time, the means of achieving the said purpose need to be updated or ‘modernised’ since social and technological development may deem some conventional means outdated.  It is understood that Sri Lanka is a few years behind developed nations in many aspects of society and education/higher education is one of them. However, the real danger to social progress and development comes from not the apparent lag of a few years but from being complacent about it and taking it for granted as ‘the way it is’.  Our university system might not be the best in the world but it still carries a certain level of international recognition. Take this recognition for granted and we will soon see it disappear, which, sadly, seems to be happening at present. To maintain the international recognition of our universities, not just the quality of outcome (the graduates) but also the quality of the education system should be enhanced.  Due to the pandemic and the economic crisis that followed, the higher education system of the country – just like any other sector – suffered major blows but if there was any silver lining to the crises, it was that it uncovered weaknesses in the higher education system including the existing evaluation system.  However, instead of focusing on improvement, the authorities are seemingly following the conventional means of development which aren’t just outdated but also proven to be ineffective.       In a statement, State Minister of Higher Education Dr. Suren Raghavan revealed plans to implement a four-month compulsory social service activity programme for students enrolling in State universities from next year. While the university system readies itself to enrol 41,000 new students for the upcoming academic year, these students will be mandated to participate in a four-month, course-specific social service activity programme as a prerequisite for university admission.  If history teaches us anything, it is that ‘change’ isn’t something a short course or a programme can instil in the minds of university students. The compulsory leadership training programme for undergraduates which was implemented in 2011 is a case in point. The three-week leadership training and positive thinking development programme was promoted as a capacity-building programme that helps students enhance their careers but in reality, was perceived by many as rigorous military training as it was conducted by the Ministry of Defence. The programme aimed to discourage violence among university students, ragging and keep students away from political involvement. More than a decade since its implementation, ragging continues in many State universities and nobody needs to elaborate about university students’ political involvement over the past two years.  While the new programme criteria may differ drastically from the compulsory leadership training programme and might have materialised out of the best intentions for students, the fact of the matter isn’t the programme itself but the necessity of it, especially considering the many burning issues demanding attention in university education.  For one, the international regard for some State universities is waning due to the brain-drain of university academics and the lack of funds to conduct research, which is the lifeblood of any university system. Moreover, the pandemic brought to light the lack of technology in the university education system when physical classes and in-person exams could not be conducted. Further, it underlined the need for an assignment-based evaluation system rather than the existing exams-based one.  While there are some concerns regarding the student culture and the behaviour of students in universities such as ragging and the way political activities are being carried out, these aren’t issues that a three-week training course of a three-month programme could effectively solve. Creating a free-thinking, educated, knowledgeable and socially responsible citizen isn’t something that can be achieved at the university level alone. To do so, an across-the-board change in the entire education system is needed. Instead of doing that, trying our luck and investing in these types of band-aid solutions is bound to fail.   Changing the system would be the most effective and sustainable solution instead of trying to change the students. The time has come to think long-term! "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "
