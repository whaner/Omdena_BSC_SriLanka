The workshop focused on forthcoming special drug-related operations.  The event was held under the patronage of Public Security Minister Tiran Alles and Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon. The Police Media Division said this data system allows immediate input of details for any individual apprehended, facilitating the retrieval of existing criminal records at all Police stations. As of now, the data system has been updated with information on individuals arrested for drug-related offenses."

The primary accused, the former Mayor, was also instructed to pay a fine of Rs 25,000, while all other defendants were directed to pay fines of Rs 50,000 each. Failure to remit these fines would result in an additional six months being added to their prison sentences. On 6 August 2020, the Kurunegala Magistrate issued arrest warrants against the Mayor, the Municipal Commissioner, an Engineer and two others in connection with the demolition of the ‘Raja Sabha Mandapaya’, a historically significant building dating back to the 13th Century, presumed to be the King’s Court of King Buwanekabahu II. Previously, the Attorney General had directed the Acting Inspector General of Police to obtain warrants and arrest the individuals. However, on 10 August 2020, the Kurunegala Magistrate re-issued the arrest warrants as the Police had failed to execute earlier ones. On 11 August 2020, five individuals, including the Kurunegala Mayor, filed writ petitions challenging the arrest warrants issued against them. The building in question, also known as the Buwaneka Hotel, believed to be the assembly hall used by contemporary rulers in the 13th Century, was demolished by the former Mayor on 16 July 2022, for a road development project. He claimed that the Road Development Authority (RDA) had approved the demolition. However, the Department of Archaeology filed a complaint, asserting that the demolished building was a 13th Century King’s Court and the archaeological site was listed under the Antiquities Ordinance No. 9 of 1940. In response, a five-member committee was formed to investigate the incident under the directives of then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. Simultaneously, the Attorney General obtained a Court Order to protect and restrict access to the demolished historic building site during investigations, targeting the suspects.  On 28 July 2020, the Kurunegala Magistrate instructed the former Mayor to submit all documents, related to the demolished building, to the Court’s safe custody. Additionally, the Magistrate requested all documents and minutes of the City Development Committee from the Governor of the North-Western Province. BY Ravindu Sooriyabandara – Kurunegala"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/15/four-drugs-imported-sans-nmra-registration/,Four drugs imported sans NMRA registration,Author not found,0,2023-12-14T20:34:00+00:00," Four categories of medicinal drugs, falsely portrayed as imported from India and lacking registration with the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), have been identified, with no disclosed information about their actual manufacturing location, medical trade unions alleged. Accordingly, it has been revealed that the medicinal drugs, which were currently being used in hospitals, had been supplied to the State Health Service by the supplier involved in the human immunoglobulin fraud, who is now in custody.  The drugs are: Irinotecan Hydrochloride Trihydrate injection (used in treating colon or rectal cancer), Docetaxel Injection (a chemotherapy drug. It targets fast dividing cells, like cancer cells, and cause these cells to die), Fluorescein Sodium injection (a diagnostic tool in the field of ophthalmology and optometry) and Factor V11 Injection (used to stop bleeding from injuries for patients with hemophilia by helping the blood to clot). The Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association of Doctors (MCPA) said, it would not be difficult to bring the criminals responsible for several medicinal drug scams to justice, without being influenced, if the Attorney General’s Department and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) acted according to their conscientious and committed themselves to achieve at least minute fairness towards the rights of tax payers. MCPA President, Dr. Chamal Sanjeeva yesterday (14), lamented that the CID had informed the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court that  the four categories of medicinal drugs, sans proper registration with the National Medicines Registration Authority (NMRA), had been brought under false implications of having been imported from India, had been identified. However, no information had been unravelled as to the place where they were manufactured. Dr. Sanjeeva said, it had also been revealed that several other medicinal drugs had been imported to Sri Lanka by other suppliers also on the pretext of importing medicines from India. These too had been imported allegedly without registration with the NMRA.  In addition, Dr. Sanjeeva noted that it has also been revealed in the Magisterial Court that including immunoglobulin some of the medicines had been contaminated with microbials. He said, a country was at a dilemma as to why action had not been taken to bring the responsible parties to justice, notwithstanding their social position, even after a lapse of 75 days. It is apparent that there has been a misappropriation of billions of rupees and drug trafficking with a criminal mind.  Meanwhile, President of the Government Medical Officers’ Forum (GMOF) Dr. Rukshan Bellana also expressed his displeasure over the current investigations into the drug scams.  “I don’t know what the Health Ministry is doing. It seems that they want to make it clear to the public that there is no authority to overlook the State Health Sector. It is also sad that the on-going investigations into the substandard medicine are too slow. There are serious problems about the quality of drugs we are using on patients. If I was given the salary of the CID, I can catch those who are responsible for the drug scams faster than the CID,” Dr. Bellana stressed.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne "

Senior spokesman of the Health Ministry said the strike had been called off following the Health Ministry Secretary’s intervention. National Eye Hospital doctors, headed by the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) branch union, on Wednesday (13) declared a strike in protest against the failure by authorities to so far take action regarding the misconduct of the Administrative Officer of Hospital who allegedly misused hospital property including its ambulance for her convenience.  Meanwhile, the Government Medical Officers’ Forum (GMOF) commended the Health Ministry Secretary Dr. Palitha Mahipala for intervening in the issue. President of the GMOF, Dr. Rukshan Bellana said, however, that these were not issues which needed the Health Ministry Secretary’s intervention. The Health Secretary ‘s Office acts in the policy formulating capacity, while the Office of the Director General Health Services acted in operations namely in stepping in during such crisis situations.  “It is unfortunate that the Health Ministry has such DG’s Office, which requires either the Health Minister or the Health Ministry Secretary’s office to intervene,” he said while urging the Health Ministry Secretary to utilise his experience of supporting the health care services of the South East Asian Region to look at what was wrong with Sri Lanka’s health service.    By Dilanthi Jayamanne "

Sara Shaw, spokesperson for FoEI, stated, “The COP28 deal has fallen short of delivering meaningful commitments on fossil fuel phaseout and urgently needed climate finance.”  Concerns were raised about the inclusion of potentially distracting elements like carbon capture utilisation and storage, hydrogen, nuclear energy, and carbon removal technologies. The equity aspect of the outcome was criticised for not adequately differentiating between the roles of developed and developing countries in the transition away from fossil fuels, despite differing historical responsibilities for emissions. While a global renewable energy target was set, no concrete financial commitments accompanied it. Rich nations, including the US, UK, and EU, were accused of hypocrisy for celebrating language on transitioning away from fossil fuels while having substantial expansion plans for fossil fuel use. Shaw emphasised their failure to provide adequate climate finance needed for emissions reductions, adaptation, and loss and damage in developing countries. Carbon market negotiations collapsed at COP28, delaying the establishment of a global carbon market until the following year. This development was viewed as a victory for climate justice movements seeking to prevent the flood of potentially damaging carbon credits once the market becomes operational. The operationalisation of the Loss and Damage fund at the start of COP28 was acknowledged, but questions lingered about its accessibility, especially considering it will be hosted by the World Bank. Pledges made at the summit were criticised for falling far below the estimated damages caused by climate-related events. The presence of over 2,400 fossil fuel lobbyists at the summit and a perceived crackdown on activists’ voices further fuelled criticism. Lise Masson of FoEI emphasised that climate justice requires respect for human rights and condemned the censorship faced by activists advocating for just outcomes amid the ongoing climate crisis."

Fernando clarified that although he was not personally supportive of the government’s choice to raise VAT by 18 per cent, he emphasised the necessity of making tough decisions for the country to achieve economic turnaround. He highlighted that the government made the decision with a focus on long-term benefits for the country, considering the economic landscape beyond short-term consequences. Fernando mentioned that measures would be implemented to prevent intermediaries from taking advantage and profiting at the expense of consumers following the imposition of the 18 per cent VAT on goods.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The SL20 and SL23 fishing boats, measuring 6.3 and 7 metres in length, were meticulously designed for coastal fishing operations in Sri Lanka. Adhering to FAO/ILO/IMO standards, these boats prioritise the safety of fishers and are built to be capsize-resistant and withstand the challenges posed by climate change, including more frequent and intense storms and cyclones. The designs of these climate resilient boats are freely available through the FAO Fishing Vessel Design Database. The design and construction of these boats were made possible through the generous funding of the Norwegian Government -financed FAO Trust Fund project on “Responsible use of fisheries and aquaculture resources for sustainable development,” with a cost allocation of approximately nine million rupees. In addition to the boats, FAO, in collaboration with the Ministry of Fisheries, introduced 30 model fish stalls across 15 fisheries districts in Sri Lanka. These stalls, designed by the Ceynor Foundation under the Ministry of Fisheries, aim to minimise post-harvest fish quality loss by maintaining high-quality and safe conditions for fish retail selling. A recent study by the NARA revealed inadequate maintenance practices among most fish retailers in Sri Lanka. Outdoor fish stalls often display fish uncovered, without ice, in direct contact with sunlight and environmental hazards. The model fish display stalls seek to popularize retail selling stalls among fish retailers to maintain the quality of fish until it reaches the consumer. Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda expressed gratitude for FAO’s support, stating, “The handing over of these specially designed boats and fish stalls is a crucial step in ensuring the safety of our fishers and improving the overall quality of fish in our markets. This collaboration with FAO signifies our joint commitment to the development of sustainable fisheries in Sri Lanka.” Nalin Munasinghe, Assistant FAO Representative for Programmes, highlighted the importance of the initiative, stating, “FAO remains dedicated to fostering sustainable practices and supporting local communities in Sri Lanka. The delivery of these boats and stalls exemplifies our commitment to enhancing the resilience of the fisheries sector in the face of climate change challenges.” The climate-resilient boats and model fish stalls were handed over at a ceremony held at the Cey-Nor Foundation graced by Minister Douglas Devananda, Piyal Nishantha, State Minister of Fisheries, Nalin Munasinghe, Assistant FAO Representative for Programmes, Indu Ratnayake, Secretary to the Ministry of Fisheries, S. J. Kahawatte, Director General of the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, and Dr. Dulan Hettiarachchi, Chairman of the Cey-Nor Corporation.  FAO, together with its partners, remains committed to advancing sustainable practices in Sri Lanka’s fisheries sector, contributing to the well-being of fishers and addressing the impact of climate change on coastal communities."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Under the new approach, students will be assessed based on 30% marks obtained in the Grade 5 scholarship exam, along with an additional 30% derived from evaluations conducted in the classroom during Grades 4 and 5. The Minister emphasised the importance of regular attendance for students to benefit from this evaluation method. While acknowledging concerns that some parents may argue teachers could be biased, the Minister reassured that there is no room for such situations. He stressed the need to foster better trust among teachers, parents, and students. School development boards are expected to play a crucial role in monitoring and evaluating students in the classroom.

The petition, submitted on Wednesday (13), was filed by Dilena Pathragoda, Executive Director of the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) and Hemantha Withanage, its Senior Adviser. The petitioners asserted that the approval granted to foreign firms was obtained through the use of forged documents, resulting in substantial financial losses for the State. They argued that the Eppawala phosphate deposit was a valuable national asset that should not have been handed over to foreign firms, especially when its potential could have contributed to the country’s development. The petitioners claimed that the transaction disproportionately benefited foreign countries, with Sri Lankan parties gaining minimally. They contended that the use of forged documents allowed intermediaries to reap significant profits. In light of these allegations, the petitioners sought a Supreme Court order for the respondents — the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) and its Director-General, the Central Environmental Authority (CEA), and Lanka Phosphate Ltd to initiate a special investigation.

Following this revelation, the Chief Magistrate ordered CID to obtain the bank records of several companies, registered with the Fertiliser Secretariat, suspected of engaging in fraudulent activities and accumulating significant profits. In 2018,  some 18 companies were registered with the Fertiliser Secretariat, ostensibly to supply fertilisers to farmers under a subsidy system. However, farmers are yet to receive fertiliser through this subsidised scheme. Sub-Inspector (SI) Anura Gamage, from the Financial Crimes Investigation Division of the CID, informed the Court that the fraudulent activities came to light during an investigation prompted by complaints lodged by Sumedha Perera and Ruwan Chandra, former secretaries of the Agriculture Department. The CID revealed that the companies had imported fertilisers, claiming that a bag priced at Rs 2,500 would be sold to farmers at Rs 1,100, with the government paying them the difference of prices. Despite the imported fertilisers were meant for farmers at a reduced rate, it has been confirmed that several companies registered with the Fertiliser Secretariat did not distribute them to farmers. Instead, they allegedly sold the fertilisers to non-agricultural industries at higher prices ranging from Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000. The CID identified approximately seven out of the 18 registered companies involved in this fraudulent activity during their investigation. The CID informed the Court that it is actively exploring whether the remaining companies were also involved in this scheme. Through the investigations, it has come to light that one such company fraudulently misused around Rs 100 million from State funds. SI Anura Gamage informed the Court that a committee appointed by the Fertiliser Secretariat had initiated an inquiry into the matter following the complaints lodged by the two individuals.  However, based on their preliminary findings the committee had only halted the disbursement of State funds to only two smaller companies, neglecting major factories, as some officials had taken bribes from the ‘big-corporations,’ SI Anura Gamage said.  The CID, in its report to the Court, said that, as per the ongoing investigations, seven out of the 18 registered companies are implicated in this fraudulent activity. Further inquiries will be conducted to determine the involvement of the remaining companies in this wrongdoing. BY Kumudu Upul Shantha "

Dr. Sanjeeva said, the Government had a responsibility to investigate all allegedly shady deals that had taken place by falsely claiming that there was a drug shortage.

Despite facing scepticism and mockery, he accepted the challenge with determination and dedication, supported by both MPs and the public. Wickremesinghe underscored the progress made, citing a reduction in inflation from 70 per cent to 1.5 per cent and the stabilisation of the rupee at Rs 325 – Rs 330 per dollar. He emphasised the essential elements of the chosen path, including access to IMF assistance and effective debt restructuring, which yielded positive outcomes. The President pointed out that with the approval of the second tranche from the IMF, the country stands to benefit significantly, including receiving USD 150 million from the World Bank for deposit insurance, fortifying the financial sector. He addressed concerns about imposed taxes, acknowledging the hardships faced by a segment of society and clarifying that the Government had no alternative.  Wickremesinghe dismissed the notion of imposing conditions on the IMF once in power, dismissing such claims as “childish stories” propagated by those with limited economic understanding.

Minister Alles emphasised that the deployment of STF personnel on expressway duties costs the State approximately Rs 260 million. He further stated that these personnel would now be reassigned to combat the drug menace in the country, citing a need for their expertise in addressing the issue. In response to a question posed by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa regarding the potential removal of STF personnel from expressway duties, Minister Alles highlighted the substantial vacancies within the STF, totalling 2,300 positions. He stressed the importance of utilising the STF in the fight against the drug trade. The Minister explained that STF personnel were initially assigned to expressway duties in 2011 as an interim measure when the quotation from the Fire Brigade for such duties was deemed excessive. He noted that this arrangement has been in place since then. Minister Alles assured that regular Police will continue their duties on expressways, while emphasising that, in most countries, fire and rescue operations are handled by the Fire Brigade.

COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber hailed the deal, approved by almost 200 countries on Wednesday, as a “historic package” of measures that offers a “robust plan” to keep the target of capping global temperatures at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, within reach. “We have language on fossil fuel in our final agreement for the first time ever,” said al-Jaber, CEO of the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) oil company. Officials from around the globe suggested the deal is an important step towards ending the use of fossil fuels. US climate envoy John Kerry said both the United States and China intend to update their long-term climate strategies, hailing the agreement as one which “sends very strong messages to the world”. However, the deal doesn’t go so far as to seek a “phase-out” of fossil fuels, for which more than 100 nations had pleaded. Rather, it calls for “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade”. That transition would be in a way that gets the world to net zero greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 and follows the dictates of climate science. Earlier on Wednesday, the latest draft of the document calling on the world to wean itself off planet-warming fossil fuels was discussed by delegates after an outcry over a previous proposal forced the summit, which was meant to end on Tuesday, to be extended. The previous draft offered a list of options that “could” be taken to combat the dangerous heating of the planet, while the final version explicitly “calls on” all nations to contribute through a series of actions. After the deal was approved on Wednesday, French Energy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher called it “a victory for multilateralism and climate diplomacy”. “Now we need to put in place a plan to exit fossil fuels and we will be attentive to this,” she added. Earlier, Norway’s minister for climate and the environment, Espen Barth Eide, said “It is the first time that the world unites around such a clear text on the need to transition away from fossil fuels … It has been the elephant in the room – at last, we address it head-on. This is the outcome of extremely many conversations and intense diplomacy.” Intensive negotiations continued well into the small hours of Wednesday morning after the conference presidency’s initial document angered many countries by avoiding decisive calls for action on fossil fuels, the major driver of global heating. The UAE-led presidency presented delegates with a new central document – called the global stocktake – just after sunrise. (Al Jazeera)"

As part of the ceremony, the President inaugurated a new stadium and awarded six students who demonstrated outstanding skills among the 176 graduates. In a celebratory gesture, NSBM Green University Vice Chancellor E. A. Weerasinghe presented a collection of valuable books to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Addressing the gathering, President Wickremesinghe said,”We aim to revolutionise university education to ensure that every graduate secures employment. Currently, the admission of students to government universities is restricted due to logistical challenges. However, other nations have effectively addressed this issue, aligning with the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, which asserts the right of everyone to access education. In line with this, governments and private entities worldwide have established universities. As Sri Lanka, we are now prepared to undertake this task. Our goal is to significantly increase the number of universities in the country, potentially doubling or tripling their current count. Simultaneously, leveraging new technology allows students in Sri Lanka the opportunity to earn degrees from foreign universities without leaving the country. We envision Sri Lanka becoming a hub for universities. Additionally, we aspire to complete the task of imparting English proficiency to both school and university students by 2030. Furthermore, we seek to equip students in our country with knowledge of additional languages. In our efforts, we plan to establish vocational training colleges by merging existing vocational training institutes. To enhance employability, we are introducing job-oriented curricula for these courses. Encouragingly, the private sector has pledged support for these initiatives, and we anticipate implementing this programme by the coming year. After that, it is our expectation to bring the necessary laws to reorganise the entire education system in this country. Thus, it should be said that our aim is to start the program of using university education and vocational training education for the development of this country from next year, as knowledge is needed to develop the country. A new education system should be created for that. We should act as a middle income country. We have to decide whether we will remain in this state forever, or whether we will become a high income economy. We all want to go on that journey. So we leave it to education to build the necessary human resources”. Nihal Ranasinghe, Secretary of the Ministry of Education, NSBM Green University Vice Chancellor E. A.

Rangebandara also praised that this was possible only because a well-experienced  Leader like President Ranil Wickremesinghe who is the Finance Minister managed the Budget. The General Secretary said he was able to fix the burning economic crisis to a significant level finding solutions to burning issues one-by-one by relaxing the livelihood issues of the people in a short span of just one year. While addressing the media at Sirikotha, Rangebandara said that the Budget 2024 will be helpful to wipe out the misconception about Sri Lanka as a bankrupt nation in the presence of the rest of the world. “The allocations for social security and welfare have been increased from Rs 60 billion to  Rs 200 billion, it is more than three-times larger than allocations made in the last budget. President Wickremesinghe has allocated  Rs 30 billion to develop small and medium-scale enterprises this year, realising the truth that it is also one of the most important sectors that moot the economic advancement of the country. Borrowing facilities are available to small and medium entrepreneurs at a low and affordable interest rate of 4 per cent,” Rangebandara further said. He said that budget arrangements have been made to provide permanent deeds to a total of two million to lands where they are living without any ownership, though they are benefiting from it. Government has made arrangements to provide them with permanent deeds under the land ownership programme on Independence Day on 4 February 2024. further, the people living in rented houses in densely populated urban areas will be made owners of these houses and need not pay huge sums as rent while making arrangements to construct a house. Providing land ownership to estate workers acknowledging their 200-year service to the economy of this country was also proposed in the Budget, Rangebandara said. President Wickremesinghe has made a Budget proposal to establish four national universities in addition to the existing universities to expand higher -education facilities to educate young men and women in Sri Lanka, Rangebandara said. Arrangements have been made in the Budget to resume the food and accommodation allowance that had been suspended during the previous regime.

This was disclosed during a workshop held in Colombo, dedicated to discussing the contents of the multi-sectoral National Action Plan addressing Sexual and Gender-Based Violence against Women (SGBV). Dr. Mapitigama’s insights cast light on the urgent need for comprehensive action in addressing this critical issue. Speaking to Ceylon Today on a separate occasion, Dr. Mapitigama referenced a study conducted in 2022 in the Colombo and Badulla Districts. The study highlighted that 38.6 per cent of women reported experiencing some form of violence during their cohabitation with a partner, and notably, 15.9 per cent of them were pregnant women. This points to the pressing need for proactive measures to address and prevent gender-based violence, particularly during the vulnerable period of pregnancy. In 2022, a total of 10,871 individuals visited ‘Mithuru Piyasa’ counselling centres set up by the Ministry of Health nationwide, with 796 of them being pregnant women, accounting for 7.3 per cent of the total visits, Dr. Mapitigama said.  She remarked, “In Sri Lankan culture, a pregnant woman is considered a symbol of prosperity. Consequently, there is a natural assumption that she is well taken care of by her partner, family and the community as a whole, particularly by her partner. However, the reality is that many women endure harassment and violence from their partners during their pregnancy, and as a society, we often fail to openly discuss this issue. There is a pervasive assumption that everything is fine with pregnant women, when in fact, the challenges they face are often hidden from public awareness.” Speaking further, Dr. Mapitigama emphasised that global studies have indicated a significant trend regarding the onset of IPV faced by women. Astonishingly, a substantial 30 per cent of respondents reported that the commencement of such harassment occurred during pregnancy.  By Methmalie Dissanayake"

He clarified that the revenue generated from the increased VAT would be reinvested in the sector, with Rs 1.5 billion allocated for AI research and an additional Rs 8 billion for broader technological research. The President highlighted that the increased tax would not adversely affect the IT industry, given its export-oriented nature. Emphasising that the export of IT services is considered a zero-rated supply, the President said the IT services provided to individuals outside Sri Lanka, with payments in foreign currency, are exempt from income tax. Stressing the need for the decision to increase VAT to apply uniformly across all sectors without exceptions, he cited comparable practices in other countries. Highlighting the Government’s commitment to supporting research initiatives, the President affirmed that the focus is shifting toward facilitating research and development in the IT sector. He expressed confidence that despite the VAT increase, the industry would thrive in Sri Lanka, fostering digitalisation and expansion over the next two to three years. President Wickremesinghe outlined a collaborative approach, leveraging partnerships with India to propel the growth of the entire digital sector, despite the 18 per cent VAT imposition.

Addressing the recent decision by the Government and the National Treasury to stop providing subsidies to the CEB, the Minister said these measures were implemented following recommendations from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce government spending. He also emphasised that the restructuring process might involve scrutinising the present number of CEB employees and their efficiency. The Minister highlighted that although a Cabinet decision earlier this year called for revising tariffs twice a year, the Ministry had to conduct an ad-hoc revision of prices in October due to climate forecasts from the Department of Meteorology. Minister Wijesekera stated that, based on data from the Meteorology Department, Sri Lanka would experience drought from 15 November 2023 to early February 2024. However, contrary to the forecast, Sri Lanka has been witnessing heavy rainfall islandwide, resulting in a healthy level of hydro storage for the near future. The Minister also said the decrease in the cost of coal in the global market would benefit Sri Lanka. Further, the Minister added that the Government plans to provide relief to the public by revising tariffs in January 2024 if possible. Minister Wijesekera urged the experts and officials present to submit their suggestions and ideas to the Ministry of Energy in the coming days to achieve this goal. By Buwanaka S. Perera"

Pedris, aged 27 at the time, faced a military court and was convicted of treason by the British colonial administration in Sri Lanka. The charges against him included rioting and treason against the government, resulting in a death sentence in 1915, despite all appeals. Edward Henry Pedris’ body was subsequently cremated at an undisclosed location following the procedures prescribed for the cremation of a convicted criminal under martial law. However, it later came to light that his death was orchestrated by senior officials governing the country at that time. The Cabinet granted approval for the President’s proposal to establish a three-member committee, chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge Anil Gunarathna, to investigate the circumstances surrounding Edward Henry Pedris’ killing. Edward Henry Pedris, a Ceylonese militia officer and a prominent socialite, was executed for treason during the 1915 Sinhalese-Muslim riots by the 17th Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army under martial law. His expedited conviction through a three-day Field General Court Martial, bypassing the local legal system, was perceived as unjust by the local population and served as a warning to other leaders in the region, according to Sri Lankan historical accounts."

It came to light during the recent meeting of the Committee on Ways and Means of Parliament as the ban was lifted, Prima and Serendib reportedly profited substantially by implementing a tax of Rs 16 per kg on wheat flour. The committee also discussed the unfair profits earned by companies through the increase in the special commodity tax for sugar from 25 cents to Rs 50, demanding immediate action to collect prescribed taxes related to these instances. Also, the committee directed officials of the Excise Department to suspend the liquor licence of a manufacturing company that failed to pay the due tax installment, in accordance with the installment plan for clearing arrears of excise duty. Additionally, the committee questioned the delay in receiving the report from the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) regarding taxpayers with arrears of Rs 100 million or more, as mandated on 24 July 2023. Despite two requests during committee meetings, the IRD has not yet provided the required report. The committee chair MP Patali Champika Ranawaka revealed that the IRD officials sought the Attorney General’s opinion on the matter, instructing them to submit the list to the committee by 31 December 2023. Expressing displeasure over the non-compliance with recommendations related to the IRD, the committee emphasised the importance of timely implementation.  To recover arrears from taxpayers evading taxes, the committee recommended the preparation of a tax collection plan targeting the recoverable amount of Rs 173 billion. The committee urged the Ministry of Finance and the IRD to collaboratively devise and implement this plan before 31 December. Among the 39 recommendations made to the Excise Department, the committee inquired about the non-implementation of the recommendation to increase the licence renewal fee to a minimum of 10 million rupees. The committee also questioned the failure to provide a list of individuals and companies holding more than one liquor license in a district, as previously ordered. Excise Department officials claimed their data system showed no such instances, prompting the committee to request written confirmation. The committee was informed that there are currently 46 toddy production plants, and a mobile app has been introduced to monitor and calculate their daily production. The committee chair instructed the officers to present the mobile app during the next meeting. Highlighting the need for artificial intelligence (AI) integration into customs scanners, the committee recommended preparing a proposal under a public-private joint project model with the guidance of IT consultants from the Ministry of Finance. Finally, the committee discussed the follow-up on Disaster Management, Welfare Benefit Scheme, and Social Services Department’s survey involving urban beggars. Officials from various departments, including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Defence, Inland Revenue Department, Excise Department, Sri Lanka Customs, and the Welfare Benefits Board, were summoned for the meeting.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Against this backdrop, the launch of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 2024 Asia-Pacific Human Development Report in November, represents a crucial step in revitalising human development amidst a complex landscape of growth. Nationally, the UNDP 2024 Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, titled ‘Making Our Future: New Directions for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific’ was launched today, under the umbrella of the flagship Colombo Development Dialogues. This report serves as a robust foundation, offering in-depth insights to comprehend the hurdles faced by marginalised communities and supporting policymakers in crafting precise and impactful strategies. Utilising the most current data, evidence, and analytical perspectives, the Regional Human Development Report (Regional HDR) offers an extensive and finely detailed evaluation of human development in Asia and the Pacific. Emphasising a proactive outlook, it urges the region to not only learn from prior achievements and established frameworks, but also to surpass traditional methodologies in order to steer human development in this dynamic era. This necessitates reevaluating approaches, a more seamless integration of human development and growth, and a heightened dedication to translating strategies into actionable results. Commenting on the report, Anura Dissanayake, Secretary to the Prime Minister in his message noted that, “As we prioritise rebuilding as a country, we also need to lay out the safety nets in the form of social protection for the most vulnerable and people who have been severely impacted by the crisis. UNDP has provided us through the Multi-dimensional Vulnerability Index and now the Regional Human Development Report evidence that can contribute to an equation that will assist us in getting the formula right to plan accordingly to ensure no one is left behind as we rebuild from the ruins of the economic crisis.” The report marks the commencement of a dialogue aimed at delving into the hurdles and prospects encountered as  Sri Lanka drives towards economic rejuvenation. This event convened key stakeholders, spanning government officials, experts, private sector representatives, civil society organisations, and international partners, fostering an inclusive platform to assess present obstacles, exchange successful methodologies, and cultivate a collective discourse. The gathering aimed to pave the way for a holistic and cooperative strategy, addressing the evolving challenges and issues impacting both the country and the wider region. Highlighting the importance of the report, Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP in Sri Lanka said, “The newly released 2024 Regional Human Development Report for Asia and the Pacific, which includes Sri Lanka, serves as a guide to rethink development strategies. UNDP Sri Lanka proposes a framework based on policy levers and initiatives that build on our collective strengths, drawing from past experiences to chart a course towards high-quality development aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” This report comes in light of the launch of the Policy Report titled ‘Understanding Multidimensional Vulnerabilities: Impact on People of Sri Lanka’ which put forward Sri Lanka’s first-ever Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI). It demonstrates the overlapping challenges faced by Sri Lanka’s population, weaving together a novel set of indicators to capture vulnerabilities beyond traditional income-based measures.  Together, the MVI and Regional HDR, stand not only as representations of challenges and aspirations but also as an urgent call to action to policymakers and influencers, for an inclusive, resilient, and prosperous future. The insights from the Regional HDR must be transformed into impactful initiatives, laying the foundation for a resilient tomorrow for Sri Lanka and the broader region."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/12/hrcsl-issues-17-page-set-of-guidelines-for-police/,HRCSL issues 17-page set of guidelines for Police,Author not found,0,2023-12-11T20:36:00+00:00," In a bid to prevent custodial and encounter deaths, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has drafted a 17-page ‘General Guidelines and Recommendations’ for the Sri Lanka Police. Following its inquiries and received complaints, the HRCSL identified 24 instances of custodial deaths and 13 cases of encounter deaths involving the Sri Lanka Police from January 2020 to August 2023. Notably, six custodial deaths and two encounter deaths occurred within the first half of 2023. During this period, the custodial deaths recorded were linked to Police stations or divisions primarily situated in three main districts: Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara. Except for three victims, all individuals succumbed to their injuries within 24 hours of being arrested by the Sri Lanka Police. These reported deaths occurred during attempts to locate weapons or narcotics, involving cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or due to the negligence or omissions of the officers on duty. Regarding encounter deaths, most cases reported to the Commission were associated with Police stations or divisions in the districts of Colombo, Gampaha and Galle. Three cases in Colombo were specifically linked to the Special Task Force (STF). All reported encounter deaths occurred either during arrests or when the Police claimed to be exercising their right of self-defence while dealing with individuals displaying violent behaviour. In this context, the HRCSL was of the view that general guidelines and recommendations need to be issued to Sri Lanka Police to prevent custodial and encounter deaths and to safeguard the inherent right to life of all persons. HRCSL recommends the following safeguards before, during and after arrest:  While preparing to arrest a suspect, the HRCSL said the Police officers should respect the right of every person to be free from arbitrary arrest in terms of Article 13(1) of the Sri Lankan Constitution. Arrests should not be carried out in an arbitrary manner. Every Police officer who makes an arrest of a person must be able to justify its necessity on the basis of reasonable suspicion that the person has committed an offence following a preliminary Police investigation. The preliminary investigation must be carried out prior to the arrest. It can either take place at the point of observing a person committing an offence or attempting to commit an offence, or at the Police station to which any information or intelligence regarding an offence or attempt to commit an offence is received. Police officers should respect the right of every person to be presumed innocent until proven guilty as guaranteed by Article 13(5) of the Constitution.  During preliminary investigations, all suspects should be afforded the right not to self-incriminate. Police officers should respect the right of any suspect to remain silent and not be forced under any circumstance to make any self-incriminating statements. Arrest should not be carried out where a person is coerced into making a self-incriminating statement following being summoned to provide a statement to the Police in terms of Section 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 during a preliminary investigation. When summoning a person to make a statement, the Police should at all times respect the rights of such person under Section 110(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure: Such person shall be bound to answer truly all questions relating to such case put to him by such officer or inquirer other than questions which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty of forfeiture’ (emphasis added). In the event that the Police receive information or intelligence regarding criminal movements or attempts to commit a grave criminal offence, such information or intelligence should be reduced into writing in the Personal Note Book.   The senior Police officer in charge of deploying Police officers to arrest a suspect must assess the risks and challenges the Police may encounter in the process of apprehending the suspect. Based on the risk assessment, the senior Police officer may determine: The composition and number of Police officers that should be deployed in the arrest operation; The type and number of vehicles that should be deployed for the operation; Authorised means of restraint and weapons the Police officers may be equipped with during the arrest operation. In the event of a planned arrest of a female suspect, the composition of the team of Police officers involved in the arrest operation should include at least one female officer.   All Police officers with the knowledge of an arrest operation must ensure strict confidentiality regarding the operation and any other information or intelligence received by the Police regarding the details and locations of the suspect. While arresting a suspect, HRCSL, in its guidelines, said all Police officers making an arrest must bear accurate, visible and clear identification on their uniforms at all times. In the event that a special arrest operation requires the officers to be in civilian clothes, the officers should have their official identity cards in their possession to prove their identity at any given time.  In general, force should not be used when making an arrest.    By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Further, admitting patients with substance misuse problems to regular acute wards instead of a separate unit was also identified to be a substantial issue. In addition, overcrowding and understaffing appeared to be a common problem faced by a majority of the aforementioned units. While the general structure of the daily routines of these patients was observed to be similar, some differences can be seen in relation to their special needs, and rehabilitating activities. Even though the visitation hours of NIMH are from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. unlike in other hospitals, it appeared that there is a limited number of visitors, and a lot of patients are waiting for their families to return to their homes.  By the powers vested in the Human Rights Commission under the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996, the Commission initiated a fact-finding mission to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to address many allegations levelled against the institution to ascertain and assess the present human rights issues relating to NIMH, and to make recommendations to the relevant authorities.  Amongst these allegations are the unsuitable ways the patients are being handled by the staff, the way restraints are used on the patients and the methods that are used when obtaining the patients’ consent for various matters. It should be noted that some of these actions amount to torture and degrading treatment. The most recent incident that alarmed the Commission was the death of a patient suspected to have been caused by some extreme measures used by the support staff. In addition to the Court proceedings that are presently ongoing, the Human Rights Commission is also conducting a separate investigation into this incident, the HRCSL said. The team appointed for the mission has adopted the fact-finding techniques of reviewing existing documentation and literature, conducting site visits and observation of the work environment, administering questionnaires and conducting interviews to collect data.   Also, the HRCSL said the patients are provided with three meals a day at NIMH and are served tea thrice a day. Special diets are provided to patients with diabetes, those suffering from malnutrition, and those who are on feeding tubes. While there were complaints about food being too salty and tasteless, the Commission also observed that the food appeared to be watery. It was mentioned by the hospital kitchen that due to issues regarding the Circular under which the spices should be ordered, the kitchen suffers a lack of spices to properly season the food. While the lighting, temperature and ventilation were acceptable in some wards, problems were identified in relation to the provision of light bulbs, availability of natural light and functioning of the fans. The Commission also observed that the number of beds for the number of patients in some units was inadequate, thereby necessitating patients to share beds or sleep on the floor. There was no proper storage space to store patients’ personal property in the wards. While most locker systems appeared to be broken, some patients have resorted to storing their belongings inside their pillowcases. Further, it was observed that mosquitoes were a serious issue since mosquito nets cannot be put in place due to the suicide risks of patients. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

According to the Sri Lanka Navy, the fishermen were allegedly involved in ‘illegal poaching’ and were detained during a special operation on Saturday night. Twelve Tamil fishermen from Nagapattinam were reportedly captured on 9 December by the Sri Lanka Navy. “We bring to your kind attention the arrest of 12 Tamil fishermen from Nagapattinam by the Sri Lanka Navy on 9 December, and their fishing boat bearing registration number IND-TN-06-MM-7675 was also apprehended. We request the kind intervention of our External Affairs Ministry for the early repatriation of the detainees and the release of their fishing boat,” Annamalai said in the letter.

On the recommendation of the specialist, the antibiotic Ceftriaxone was administered, they said.  The patient had complained that his arm was growing lifeless as soon as the one-gramme injection was being administered. He was immediately transferred to the HDU. Tests done in the HDU allegedly showed that his blood pressure and oxygen saturation had decreased drastically. However, his condition had improved by yesterday (11) afternoon. ​ Kumudesh stressed that it was the responsibility of the new Health Minister, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana to conduct a formal probe into yet another incident since the dangers of substandard and fake medicinal drugs coming into the country and the import method have not changed despite the change of heads. Therefore, it is unfortunate that the same people who spoke against the low-quality medicinal drugs were now attempting to normalise the situation, he lamented.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne "

Ltd. (SHMA) of A. Baur & Co. Pvt Ltd., also known as Baurs, in its pursuit to empower the country’s youth to take on the hospitality industry to greater heights, recently announced its first centre of the Skills for Sustainable Growth (SSG) programme at the Naula National Youth Corps based in the Matale district.  This initiative comes after careful evaluation based on the many hotels in the surrounding areas and considering the low-income levels of potential students in the Matale district. Recently, SHMA signed an MoU with the National Youth Corps of Sri Lanka (NYC) where many other centres will be established across the country in phases. The SSG programme is a private and public sector partnership between Baurs and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the agency for international cooperation of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) of Switzerland.  Currently, SHMA has enrolled 54 students at the Naula National Youth Corps centre, facilitated by Damitha Alwis who inaugurated the batch of students, and applying a centre-learning approach to ensure their success through the facilitation of the programme. The course content, which is based on a Swiss Vocational Skills Development (VSD) curriculum, includes three months theoretical lessons, one-and-a-half months blended learning and four-and-a half- month internship at a star class hotel. Further, soft skills development workshops are being provided to develop underprivileged students to excel in the hospitality trade. NYC is also providing a 14-day life skills training with team building activities and personal development which has a tremendous impact on student transformation. This is evident in every student who is enrolled at NYC. Students also have access to the Learning Management System (LMS) enabling them to engage in their course work at their convenience where each student is monitored and given due consideration and attention with this new approach. Numerous hotels have pledged their support towards the SSG programme and are willing to extend their cooperation to provide blended learning and internship opportunities for students. The SSG project will create 2,240 skilled young men and women by 2025 including increased female participation in hospitality education to 40%. The distinctiveness of the project is that two-third of its curriculum weighs towards practical on-the-job training coupled with internships and possible extension in various hotels, challenging the current practices when it comes to hospitality education. The diverse and experienced professionals at SHMA will facilitate the programme at NYC in producing competent and employable youth, whilst NYC continues to support the SSG project. SHMA survey revealed that 92.3% of students received promotions either in their current employment or within a new organisation, with over 75% of the students employed at 5-star establishments at present, and many have enjoyed a significant increase in their earning capacity. SHMA is an education institute that facilitates high-class education meeting international standards, producing highly qualified hoteliers. The academy is also licensed to deliver the VET (Vocational Education Training) by EHL Professional Diploma program offering specialised tracks in Culinary, Food & Beverage, and Hotel Operations, which is provided by École hôtelière de Lausanne, a pioneer in hospitality education since 1893, with a global network of over 25,000 alumni representing more than 120 nationalities. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Speaking further, the State Minister said 138 items have been granted exemption from VAT, but under the new Amendment, 97 items will now be subject to VAT.  He said Short Message Service (SMS) in fixed telephone networks will also be subjected to VAT, given the increased number of text messages sent. He clarified that VAT will be imposed on both petrol and diesel, while certain items such as vegetables, fruits, rice flour and medicine will continue to be exempt from VAT. While the debate was underway, the Opposition MPs staged a walkout, citing the unavailability of the list containing 97 items slated for VAT imposition. Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella asserted that without documents providing relevant information, the debate could not proceed.

The committee convened under the chairmanship of MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage to gather insights from the Tax Appeals Commission. Potential amendments to the Inland Revenue Department Act were discussed. During the meeting, it came to light that the processing time for tax appeals in the Inland Revenue Department averages over 40 months. Subsequently, these appeals are referred to the Tax Appeals Commission, where they undergo a two-year review. Following this, appeals may further proceed to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, taking an additional minimum of one year to reach a final decision. Surprisingly, the committee revealed that 95 per cent of tax appeals referred to the Commission aligned with the conclusions drawn by the Inland Revenue Department. Recognising the urgency of the situation, the committee stressed the necessity for a prompt revision of the existing timeline for examining tax appeals. Aluthgamage proposed the revision of the prolonged timeframe, advocating for the completion of one appeal within a maximum period of two years. Committee members echoed the sentiment, emphasising the identification of individuals intentionally evading tax payments. They suggested that collecting owed taxes from such individuals would provide relief to the public burdened by VAT, income tax and related taxes. Officials from the Tax Appeals Commission highlighted the significance of introducing a dedicated law to expeditiously examine and resolve tax appeals. In response, Aluthgamage outlined a commitment to amend the Inland Revenue Department Act within six months, ensuring that all relevant departments work diligently to enhance the efficiency of the tax collection process in the country."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The recent meeting chaired by Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle focused on gender-based discrimination and violation of women’s rights in Sri Lanka, recently revealed instances of injustice in the promotions in the Sri Lanka Police Service. The committee raised concerns related to the promotion process. It was highlighted that 92 female chief inspectors, having completed twenty-six years of service with an additional four years in the chief inspector role, faced challenges in their promotion process. Despite undergoing identical recruitment, training, salary structures and deployment processes as their male counterparts, female officers reported a distinct lack of identified vacancies for their promotions. The issue drew attention to the absence of problems related to vacancies during the promotion of male officers. In response to this gender disparity, the Committee proposed the creation of vacancies specifically designated for a 15% female representation in all positions. The objective is to rectify the present situation, establish a promotion system impacting both genders equally and ensure just promotions within a specified timeframe. Officials from the Ministry of Public Security confirmed that proposals for generating new vacancies with a focus on female representation had been forwarded to the Department of Management Services. To address the ongoing concern, the Committee Chair recommended to the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Security that, given the current 15% female representation in the Sri Lanka Police, an equivalent percentage of vacancies should be reserved for female officers to rectify the imbalance in the promotion process."

The Chief Incumbent in a recent statement, raised concerns about military personnel in civvies at the sacred site and they could pose a threat.  When Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa made a statement on the matter, State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon said the military personnel stationed at the sacred site would be withdrawn if the chief incumbent perceives their presence as a threat to his life.  Tennakoon said there was a total of 225 security personnel deployed at the site, representing, Sri Lanka Amry, Sri Lanka Navy and Civil Security Department.  Addressing the issue, the state minister clarified, “The two individuals in civilian clothing are military personnel. They were assigned to ensure the security of the temple and the tourists after assessing the security situation. If their presence is deemed threatening, we have decided to withdraw all military personnel from the temple premises.” Meanwhile, Army Spokesman Brigadier Ravi Herath said all soldiers have been evacuated from the premises of the Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya.  He said this decision was in response to a media statement by the temple’s head, who expressed suspicion about the behavior of two soldiers within the temple premises. Brigadier Herath elaborated that the Army had been deployed to ensure the safety of foreign tourists visiting the premises and to provide security for military personnel involved in construction activities of the sacred site.  However, due to the strained relations between the chief incumbent and the military personnel, the evacuation of all troops from Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya premises was necessary for their safety. Meanwhile, the Police said no action has been taken to withdraw the police personnel assigned to the Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya and they will continue duties at the sacred site.

Delivering a special statement on this ocassion, Turkish Ambassador in Colombo, Demet Şekercioğlu, said, the significance of year 2023 reverberates beyond the centenary proclamation of the Turkish Republic.  “We also commemorate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our Republics. It is worth mentioning that Türkiye was among the first countries to recognise Sri Lanka’s independence 75 years ago. Our relation gained a new dimension with the establishment of our Embassy here in Colombo 10 years ago, indeed serving as a true testament to our growing and flourishing partnership”, he said. The enduring relationship between the two countries was celebrated with the issuance of a special commemorative postage stamp.  The Ambassador said that as much as our deep-rooted connections, the design and decorations on the sides of this stamp feature the iconic regions of Cappadocia in Türkiye and Sigiriya in Sri Lanka, symbolising our intertwined histories.  Cappadocia is a region in Central Anatolia, Türkiye, where nature and history merge. It is best known for its unique geological features called fairy chimneys, underground cities, cave churches.   Cappadocia, sculpted out of the tuff of Mount Erciyes and Mount Hasan through millions of years by sand and water erosion, became the seat of several civilisations, and a silent witness to the cultural history of Anatolia.  Cappadocia was included in the World Heritage List of UNESCO in 1985 under the name “Göreme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia” on natural and cultural criteria. The stunning landscape of Cappadocia is also one of the most popular destinations for hot air balloon rides in the world.  At the same time, Sigiriya, synonym to Lion’s Rock in Sinhalese, is also UNESCO World Heritage site located in the Central Province of Sri Lanka in the Matale District.  Sigiriya is also monolithic rock rising above the surrounding plain to a height of 349 meters above the sea level.  Adding to the similarities of the two regions, one can also take a scenic view of Sigiriya and its surrounding by hot air balloon rides. It is also a pleasant coincidence that these balloon tours are also organised by SriLanka Balloon, which is a Turkish company.  The stamps were designed by the talented Sri Lankan artist Vasantha Perera, well-known for having designed 39 unique stamps for the Sri Lanka Philatelic Bureau.  The stamps showcase the cultural parallels between the two nations, with traditional elements like tulip and the carnation as side decorations. The tulip and the carnation are also common elements in both of Turkish and Sri Lankan traditional designs. Ambassador Şekercioğlu also said, the stamps’ envelope reflects a drawing of the historic building ‘Villa Stamboul’, linking us to a shared past.  The lavish ‘Stamboul Villa’ was built by Sir Mohamed Marcan Marker, born in 1877 and served as the Honorary Consul for the Ottoman Empire from 1903 until 1923, when the Ottoman Empire ceased to exit. He has named his villa after the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Istanbul.  The street on which the villa is established is a private road, and is also called Stamboul Place. “As we turn the page of a century based upon these monumental milestones, it is with great optimism that I envisage a flourishing future of enhanced cooperation between our two nations. May the friendship between Türkiye and Sri Lanka continue to prosper in the centuries to come and may our shared journey ahead be filled with remarkable milestones of triumph and togetherness,” the Ambassador said. "

The ‘Civil Society Initiative on Anti-Corruption Reform for Economic Recovery,’ comprising Verité Research, Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA), Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement, People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) and National Peace Council (NPC), emphasised the urgency of addressing the economic crisis rooted in weak governance and entrenched corruption. This call was prompted by the recent release of the Governance Diagnostic Report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Civil Society Governance Diagnostic Report on the Corruption Landscape of Sri Lanka. Both reports underscored the necessity for comprehensive anti-corruption governance reforms. Nadishani Perera, former Executive Director of TISL, highlighted the Supreme Court’s recent landmark decision affirming that the economic crisis resulted from a governance failure. Perera emphasised the need to halt corruption and poor governance, which diverted relief and development funds from reaching those most in need. The coalition stressed the importance of prioritising and implementing governance reforms identified by civil society and the IMF to successfully restore the economy. The recent public uprising and economic crisis underscored the breakdown of public trust, necessitating the government to regain trust through concrete actions and reforms. The coalition advocated for institutions combating corruption to comprise individuals with integrity, appointed through an independent process, enabling them to act independently without fear of repercussion. Moreover, the coalition emphasised the need for a conducive environment for civic engagement, expressing concern about the government’s suppression of public expression and attempts to curtail freedoms through oppressive laws. The President and Government were urged to move beyond promises and demonstrate a commitment to transparent and accountable governance, implementing specified reforms while safeguarding democratic rights and civic space. The coalition called on public representatives in Parliament to demonstrate a commitment to real system change through actions, and international lenders and donors were urged to maintain pressure for governance reforms to ensure funds fulfilled their intended purposes. The public was invited to demand governance and anti-corruption reforms as essential components of economic recovery, marking International Anti-Corruption Day under the theme ‘UNCAC at 20: Uniting the World Against Corruption’."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/08/ceb-engineers-union-blames-kanchana-for-lack-of-transparency/,CEB Engineers’ Union blames Kanchana for lack of transparency,Author not found,0,2023-12-07T20:34:00+00:00," The CEB Engineers’ Union (CEBEU) has voiced apprehensions about the restructuring of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), expressing concerns over the approval of the proposed Electricity Sector Reforms Bill by the Cabinet.  They cite a distinct lack of transparency and consultation throughout the process. Despite assurances from Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera, regarding the provision of the Bill’s copy after Cabinet approval, it hasn’t been shared yet. This delay has led the CEBEU to contemplate legal action on the issue. The CEBEU has also requested an early appointment from Sagala Ratnayake to meet the President to discuss the ongoing Reform Process of CEB. According to the CEBEU, the drafting of the new Acts — replacing the Electricity Act of 2009 and the CEB Act of 1969 was carried out covertly, without involvement from individuals within the CEB or other experts from the power sector. “The approval of the new ‘Electricity Act on 20 November 2023,’ occurring without prior consultation and the absence of input from industry experts or stakeholders during the drafting process has raised significant concerns,” it said. “Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Saliya Wickramasuriya and former Chairman of BOI Thilan Wijesinghe drafted the Bill without involving any stakeholders or experts from the power sector, relying solely on their business groups,” alleged the CEBEU. They highlighted a significant omission in the draft — there’s no clause for customer protection, a fundamental right for ordinary citizens. According to them, the Cabinet approved the draft Bill on 20 November, and the version circulating on social media exhibits numerous flaws, including grammatical and printing errors. The hurried and secretive manner in which it was produced behind closed doors is evident, they alleged.  Despite requests from the CEBEU, Minister Wijesekera had indicated that the draft would be shared after Cabinet approval. However, over 200 stakeholders, including those from the solar and hydro sectors, along with experts, were denied access to the Bill. Its contents have remained confidential till now, despite widespread interest and requests for transparency, the Union charged. The CEBEU said, they had even sent a letter to the Minister to show the draft and they also think that the draft that is circulating on social media is the actual draft confirmed by inside sources of the CEBEU.  But, the worst part they said is yesterday (6), the Ministry website has notified that the Bill was gazetted on 5 November and the new Bill has been uploaded to the website. But, the CEBEU said, the file cannot be downloaded and it is inactive.  Having seen that the draft cannot be downloaded, the CEBEU has visited the Department of Government Printing to obtain the gazetted copy, however, the Government Printer has said there is no such Gazette ready and that “they are proofreading”. “There is no hard copy of the draft and it should be ready if it is gazetted. We have evidence that they still don’t have the Bill ready as yet, but are hoodwinking the public,” the CEBEU said.  On 4 August 2023, the CEBEU sent a letter to the Minister of Power and Energy for a discussion with him regarding the ongoing Power Sector Reforms, including their last communication via the letter dated 18 July 2023. The letter stated that the CEBEU as the major professional stakeholder employee trade union in CEB, has been actively engaging on the need for a reform in the power sector in Sri Lanka, including a substantial restructuring of CEB during the past years. “As a professional trade union, CEBEU has already expressed our genuine enthusiasm for a truthful restructuring of the power sector in Sri Lanka including CEB, through which a significant amount of issues in the Sri Lankan power sector could be resolved. Also, we have emphasised to you that restructuring CEB only, would not solve every problem in the power sector including key issues such as policy inconsistency in the limited discussions had with you.” Further, the CEBEU had pointed out to the authorities that, despite the ambitious timeline of the Government, the reform committee and the Minister have failed to take the open and transparent approach and up to date has not had any consultation with the employees of CEB, who are the main stakeholders in the restructuring process. Moreover, CEBEU has explained that the secretive manner in which the sector reforms are being tried, will eventually lead to lack of trust in reforms and hence to failure of the process via our previous communications. “Also, it needs to be highlighted that, almost all the Trade Unions in CEB are willing to support truthful and honest reform initiatives and emphasised that to ensure the successful implementation of reform plans, genuineness of the Government will be a major deciding factor. Also, it needs to be emphasised that of our unwillingness for any move of privatisation through reform process.” “However, instead of simply agreeing or disagreeing with the current reform proposal presented and the processes continued by the Government, CEBEU opted to independently study pros and cons of reforms, observe the successes and failures of reforms in other countries and what is the optimum level and attributes of reforming of the Sri Lankan power sector. As communicated earlier, CEBEU has prepared a document called ‘An Insight of Power Sector Reforms by CEBEU’ and we were hoping to physically meet the both of you and the Secretary, MOPE to brief of the contents of the said document, along with our comments for the ongoing process of reforms.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The committee pointed out that other countries view their migrant populations positively, with Foreign Affairs Ministries advocating on their behalf. The committee emphasised that Sri Lanka’s expatriate community has attained high positions in their host countries, suggesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sri Lanka should pay attention to this aspect. The committee proposed the preparation of salary scales to attract applicants with practical skills into the recruitment process for positions within the Sri Lanka Foreign Service and suggested a reform of the recruitment system. In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that a considerable portion of marks is awarded based on the recruitment exam and academic qualifications. Consequently, candidates lacking practical knowledge, skills and the necessary personality traits may still be admitted to the service solely based on their exam scores.  This discussion took place during a recent meeting of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on International Relations in Parliament chaired by MP Namal Rajapaksa. Officials present at the Committee noted that while a significant number of candidates qualified for interviews based on academic qualifications and high scores in the foreign service recruitment examination, the practical knowledge, skills and personality necessary to meet the country’s and the service’s needs were not adequately reflected during the interviews. Additionally, the committee discussed the prolonged and complex process of providing necessary infrastructure for foreign embassies. To address this, the Committee recommended making timely changes to the procurement process. Namal Rajapaksa, Chair of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on International Relations, inquired about the internship programme, instructing officials to report to the committee about the responsibilities, roles and programmes carried out by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for groups undergoing internship training. Members of the committee MPs Niroshan Perera and Madhura Withanage also participated in the meeting.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Dr. de Silva said according to the proposals of the Finance Ministry, the VAT increase would affect several commodities, including infant food items, fertiliser, medical equipment and ambulances, including the ‘Suwaseriya’ ambulance service. He emphasised that, while recognising the importance of tax revenue for State income enhancement, COPF is urging for fairness in tax implementation.  The committee has made an appeal to the Finance Ministry to reconsider the decision to impose VAT on the mentioned goods. He said, “The Government says the cost of importing ambulances would be borne by the Government and only equipment imported by the private sector would be subjected to VAT. But we have to be realistic. Right now, there are so many shortages in the State health sector and patients are being directed to the private sector for certain tests. So, the reality is patients would be more burdened with the VAT increase on medical equipment.” He also pointed out that it is not justifiable to increase VAT on infant food items when malnutrition among children has spiked amidst the economic crisis.  In October, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a raise in VAT from 15% to 18%, effective 1 January, 2024.  BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

Breaking down the annual figures, it is revealed that there were 573,073 cases of disconnection and reconnection in 2019, followed by 210,380 in 2020, 94,201 in 2021, and 247,250 in 2022. The most recent data for the last 10 months of the current year shows a significant spike, with 544,488 instances, marking the highest frequency in this timeframe.  An interesting observation is the comparable figures between 2019 (573,073) and the recent months of 2023 (544,488), indicating a consistent pattern in disconnection and reconnection trends over the years. The spokesman emphasised the impact of external factors on these trends.  For instance, fewer power cuts and reconnections were reported in 2020 and 2021, attributed to the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2022, disruptions were limited and mainly stemmed from island-wide power cuts. Looking ahead, Priyantha projected 35,848 zero consumption accounts by November 2023. This is anticipated due to various reasons such as disconnection, house closures, lack of residents, demolitions, and new constructions. On average, approximately 150,000 new customers acquire electricity connections annually. BY Mithun Jayawardhana "

The driver, Kusantha Gunerathna, was found guilty of reckless driving, along with the bus being driven at breakneck speed and fatally running over three persons, in Udahamulla back in 2007. Delivering the verdict, Judge Balalle stated that he was imposing the said penalty on the accused, as the Prosecution had proved its charges against him, beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court also slapped a fine of Rs 18,000 on the accused bus driver and instructed him to pay compensation amounting to Rs 150,000 to the closest relatives of two of the deceased, who had been named as witnesses in the Prosecution. The Judge also ordered the accused driver, to pay a sum of Rs 100,000, to the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses (NAPVCW) and warned that failure to pay it would result in an additional 54-month jail term, being added to his original sentence. The Court imposed a lenient sentence on the accused driver, having considered a request to that effect by Defence Counsel Asitha Vipulanayake. Judge Balalle, however, acquitted the accused driver, from four other charges, filed against the latter, by the Prosecution. He then imposed a 15-month prison term, on the owner of the private bus and suspended it for a period of 15 years.

He therefore requested the Court, to impose the most stringent punishment on the accused driver, to deter others, from committing similar acts in the future. Perera also urged the Judge to impose a similar penalty on the bus owner, Chamara Liyanage, who had deployed his bus without tending to its requisite repairs, which had contributed to the accident.

I pay Rs 2.5 million annually as taxes to the State.

Also, the Attorney General AG) had clearly mentioned that he will enforce the law if such an event is staged based on a complaint lodged with the Court of Appeal. Anyone has the freedom or the right to commemorate the demise of a family member or a relative. We too attend such events. But we never visit memorials to celebrate another person’s birthday. No party carries its flag to such an event. It was stated here that the flag that had also been used by various political parties.” Minister Alles said he is not aware of a normal civilian carrying a flag with them to mark the death anniversary of a family member or a relative.  It is also clear that a large group had carried a flag with them to mark Prabhakaran’s birthday with ulterior motives. Look at the dress code of certain people who are not originally from the Eastern Province. Hence, we cannot state with certainty that either of these incidents are not linked to terrorism or the LTTE, he added. “I listened to intently related views expressed by all those concerning this proposal.  But when I began to respond to those views and when showing certain photos some MPs had begun to behave in an overly aggressive manner. When we disclose the truth, it is clear that some cannot stomach it. I also urge the Chair not to allow such people to dictate terms. Commemorating events is one thing, but allowing the vanquished LTTE Leader’s photos and flags to be displayed is another and it cannot be condoned and should be banned.” “Therefore, I urge you as MPs of your Provinces and Districts to request your people not to resort to such actions. When incidents of this scale occur, the Police cannot remain deaf and blind. As Ministers we too cannot remain like that. We have to enforce the law concerning such incidents. It has to be emphasised that the actions resorted to by the Police has not been unlawful at any stage.  As per an order issued by Court the suspects arrested were produced before Court within a 48-hour period. They were remanded based on orders issued by the Court. Though we had the chance to detain them in the Police Department we did not resort to it.

The two-judge Bench of the Court of Appeal, presided over by Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Chamath Morais ruled that as the CID had not presented any evidence indicating that Harak Kata had committed offences under the PTA and if no new evidence is provided in this regard, he must be immediately brought before the Magistrate. Additionally, the Bench rejected another petition submitted by him where he sought a writ order to invalidate the detention order issued by the CID to keep him in custody. “It should be borne in mind that this will not preclude the Minister of Defence from issuing a fresh detention order on being satisfied with the material presented before him. Subject to the said directions this writ application is dismissed without cost,” the Bench said.  Senior Counsel Senany Dayaratne with Counsel Nishadi Wickramasinghe, Sanjaya Ariyadasa, Thiru Amirthalingam and Achinika Fernando instructed by Thushari Jayawardena appeared for the petitioner. The arrest of ‘Harak Kata’ took place in Madagascar on 1 March this year, alongside his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika, alias ‘Kudu Salindu’. The operation was a joint effort involving INTERPOL, Madagascar law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. BY Kumudu Upul Shantha"

However, those in power have often refrained from utilising these funds for the welfare of the people due to personal agendas, saidEelam People’s Democratic Party (EPDP) spokesman, Iyadurai Srirangashwaran. At a press briefing held in Jaffna yesterday, he said the 13th Amendment is currently being considered as a starting point to seek a solution and a significant recognition for the Tamil issue. Srirangashwaran also recalled that when attempts were made by nationalist parties such as the JVP, Sinhala Urumaya and Jathika Hela Urumaya to reduce the powers of the provinces, Muslim parties allied with Tamil-speaking representatives and tried to disrupt these efforts in the provincial councils, receiving support from more than 50 per cent of the provincial councillors. This endeavour was thwarted and halted by the EPDP, he said. “During periods of conflict, we’ve respected the decisions made by Provincial Councils. However, these individuals are now acting independently, disregarding the President’s call and jeopardising the situation. They’ve leveraged events like the Easter attacks and disputes involving Kurunthur Malai, Vedukkunari Hindu Kovil, and other temples, contributing to the present complications while evading the fundamental issues facing the country. “In the meantime, the UNHRC has emphasised the need to address human rights issues while also advocating for the full implementation of the 13th Amendment, a crucial enforcer of human rights. While pushing for the comprehensive execution of the India-Sri Lanka agreement, let’s ensure it genuinely contributes to reconciliation, and let’s focus our efforts there,” he said. “As the 13th Amendment is already a part of Sri Lanka’s Constitution, there’s no hindrance in implementing it. However, the introduction of a new draft could spark intense debates, significant disagreements and multiple complexities, particularly in seeking a 2/3 majority in the Parliament. There is no issue in demanding the 13A implementation and we have to work in order to implement it,” Iyaduraiadded. He further told the media that in addition to the 13th Amendment, it is imperative to address the political resolution of the Tamil people through discussions both in Parliament and within the provincial administration of Jaffna.  “In the ongoing context of recent interactions between some Hindu organisations in India and a few political representatives from the North and East, discussions were held to empower Tamil political rights in Sri Lanka, signifying the need for India to take the lead in implementing the full agreement of Indo-Sri Lanka Pact to ensure Tamil political rights. This was a significant move made public” he added. “After the Eastern Province was cleared of terrorism, we advocated determining the Provincial Council to be handed over to the people of the East, through the determination of the 13A. Through electoral means, we have aimed to provide more authority to the provinces for the people. Especially, we have aimed for the Tamil National Alliance, to collaborate with 22 North and East Provincial Council members.As a single unit,the EPDP, strived to represent it singly rather than as a collective and pressed for it”, he added. During the Sri Lanka Freedom Party convention, there was an advocacy for the provincial administration of Sri Lanka to operate as a unified governance body. At that point, the TNA representatives didn’t articulate their perspective on the preferred method. Our leader Douglas Devananda solely highlighted that our party, the Eelam People’s Democratic Party, stands for governance aligned with both national and provincial systems within the country, Iyadurai further added. Hence, the demand for complete implementation of the 13th Amendment and the international human rights conventions is a significant step towards resolving longstanding issues. As of now, these individuals’ urge to completely implement the India-Sri Lanka agreement in full cooperation with humanitarian ideals is the right approach. “The 13th Amendment has been a subject of contention in Sri Lanka’s political arena, and there should be no hindrance in implementing it. However, any new attempt might face strong opposition and might cause great conflict and polarisation, making it difficult to proceed. Therefore, we strongly advocate for the complete implementation of the India-Sri Lanka agreement without any hindrance, as articulated by them,” Iyadurai further said. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

According to the SJB, the petition, initiated in front of the Fort Railway station in late November, is anticipated to traverse various towns in Sri Lanka. The petition advocates for the confiscation and obligatory compensation for citizens and victims affected by last year’s economic crisis. The SJB MP, addressing the media, accused these individuals of continuing to live off taxpayers’ money, enjoying State-provided luxury housing, vehicles and having their phone and utility bills covered by public funds. He added that the SJB is engaging with the international community to explore avenues for repatriating funds allegedly held abroad by the Rajapaksas, asserting that only a SJB government could guarantee this. Rajakaruna contended that the President and the current government lacked a mandate, asserting that they came to power through illegitimate means after being rejected by the people last year.

Subsequently, it was discovered that all the money in these accounts was fraudulently obtained without authorisation from the account holder. The CID informed Court that one individual from the group, responsible for the fraudulent withdrawal from cancer patients’ bank accounts, has been identified. They assured Court that necessary steps will be taken to arrest and bring the culprit to Court.

During the deliberations it had come to light that though the COPA Committee had instructed the Ministry to amend the aforementioned Acts during the past 11 years but it had not been implemented due to various reasons.  The Ministry officers had noted that to date, licences for 37,000 firearms had been given by them. They had asserted that as the amendments of the said Acts are in the final phase they would strive to complete that task forthwith.  The Committee had noted that as the amendments of the Acts are delayed it would prevent the State from accruing revenue via the issuance of licences and instructed the officials to expedite that process. The Committee also ordered to implement a coordinated system where additional services rendered by the armed forces could be conducted. The Committee also instructed to implement a similar system concerning the supply of food to the three armed forces.  Although it was mentioned in the constitution that the revenues generated by the services provided to external parties by the armed forces should be credited to the consolidated fund, attention was also drawn to the fact that it was not implemented properly. Although it was previously informed to prepare a proper system related to it and report to the committee, the committee asked about the fact that it has not yet been prepared. Auditor General’s Department pointed out that since most of the income goes to the welfare associations, a proper system should be set up. Although the services are being successfully carried out, the committee also advised to prepare a clear system in this regard. He also instructed the ministry officials to review this process extensively. Special attention was also paid to the procurement of food items for the three-armed forces. It was revealed at the committee that although earlier recommendations had been given to set up an information management system connecting all the institutions involved in the food items procurement process for the three-armed forces, it is being implemented only in the Navy and the Air Force. Accordingly, the officers were ordered to expedite the preparation of the system for the Army and to submit a report on this. Also, it was emphasised in the committee that parties including the soldiers should receive a meal commensurate with the money spent by the government. There was also a discussion regarding hiring a housing complex with 24 house units on a lease agreement for Rs 72 million in order to provide accommodation for the 31 officers participating in the course of the National Defence Academy. Instead of getting such houses on rent, the Committee Chair advised to pay attention to the possibility of providing accommodation facilities by constructing a new building. The Defence Secretary pointed out that since the construction has been stopped due to the current economic situation, measures will be taken in the future. Attention was also drawn to the misplacement of materials worth Rs 12 million in the consumer goods warehouse. The officials said that the all those persons related to this have been suspended and steps have been taken to collect the related money from the storekeeper. It was discussed why this incident was not revealed by the internal audit until it was uncovered by the audit of the Auditor General’s Department. Apart from this, attention was also paid to the strategic communication network project, procurement process, role of Disaster Management Centre (DMC) etc."

Only 10% agreed with both statements, stating it was necessary and done fairly. About 13% had no opinion or were unaware of the issue. In contrast, 44% disagreed with both statements, while 33% disagreed with either of the statements presented. Sri Lanka executed a distinctive Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) in September 2023, focusing solely on restructuring the retirement provident funds of formal sector workers in local currency.  The banking and financial sectors, along with private creditors and most public sector workers, were excluded. This approach could establish a new global precedent in DDR by featuring adverse rather than preferential treatment of retirement funds. The survey, based on a nationally representative sample of 1,029 Sri Lankan adults, sheds light on public sentiment regarding this controversial decision."

The ad hoc policies that had been followed by them had led to public mistrust in the free health service. It only served to confirm that questionable medicinal drug purchases had taken place. He noted that even now the corrupt procurement process such as the Immunoglobulin IV was before Court.  The new administration of the Health Ministry was tasked with rebuilding the trust of the Sri Lankan public and the international community regarding the State health system in the island in order to improve the situation. The new State health administration should work flexibly with the professional and civil organisations that were capable of pointing out the weaknesses of the health service and rectifying the deficiencies, he said.   The MCPA President said he hoped to discuss the initiation of new programmes for the development and transformation of the primary health system and to curb the shortage of medicines and conduct transparent procurement processes. Dr. Sanjeeva further stated that it is the responsibility of the new Health Secretary to do justice by the health trade union leaders, who were unjustly treated due to the strict policy adopted by it (the Health Ministry) regarding union leaders.

We believe in pedagogy that is constantly updated to mirror changes that are happening in the real world. This gives our graduates an advantage because their hands-on experience will help them hit the ground running when they enter the job market.” “The university is also committed to the principle of leaving no student behind. If a student faces any difficulties during their time at QIU, we have instituted support systems that will help them improve.

This marks a significant milestone as it is the first instance of providing postal addresses to plantation workers in the country. This was informed to the Supreme Court, by Deputy Solicitor General Kanishka de Silva, representing the Attorney General during the hearing of the Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by Jeevaratnam Suresh Kumar, a resident of the ‘Muwan Kanda’ estate in Mawathagama, requesting the Supreme Court to issue a directive to the State to provide postal addresses to the plantation workers. The petition was heard before the three-Judge Supreme Court Bench comprising Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, A.H.M.D. Nawaz, and Arjuna Obeysekera. The petitioner’s lawyer, Lakshan Dias, explained that the petition aimed to provide postal addresses to the entire estate workers’ community across the island. He acknowledged the time required for such an extensive task and appreciated the government’s efforts to address the long-standing issue faced by the plantation workers. Deputy Solicitor General Kanishka de Silva emphasised that providing postal addresses for the entire plantation community nationwide is a time-consuming programme. He mentioned that government officials are diligently working to gather information for this task, requiring additional time. Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya noted that this initiative marks a historic moment for the plantation workers, spanning over 200 years and expressed satisfaction over addressing their need for postal addresses. The Chief Justice informed the petitioner’s lawyer that, considering the fulfillment of the relief sought, the hearing of the petition would be adjourned. However, he mentioned that if the petitioner wishes to inquire about the progress after six or nine months, they have the option to bring the petition back to Court and seek an update on the activities’ progress.

He highlighted the intention to establish an independent regulatory institution, separate from the Central Bank, dedicated to overseeing and effectively regulating microfinance entities. Minister Rajapakshe made these remarks during a press briefing at the President’s Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (4) He noted that the Ministry of Justice currently oversees the operational responsibilities of 21 institutions, covering a diverse range of subjects, including law enforcement and law reform. With a caseload exceeding 1.1 million cases in the country’s Courts, concerted efforts have been made to address delays in case adjudication. Measures have been implemented to tackle backlogs and streamline the judicial process, with a focus on the establishment and operation of conciliation boards to facilitate the expeditious resolution of select cases. The Minister also highlighted the global trend of expedited methods for resolving criminal cases and contrasted it with the outdated legal framework in the country, resulting in prolonged durations for case resolutions. To address this challenge, a draft law, aimed at expediting the resolution of criminal cases, is currently under development and is scheduled for submission to Parliament in January. The new legal framework aims to explore alternatives to incarceration for individuals involved in minor offenses, aligning with the paradigm shift in advanced jurisdictions. The proposed legislation acknowledges societal oversights leading to incarceration and provides avenues for release on bail conditions, seeking to strike a balance between societal concerns and individual liberties in the criminal justice system. “To strengthen the judicial process, eight new Bills are set to be submitted to Parliament. Efforts are underway to establish reconciliation societies in each village, independent of direct government or political influence. These societies, guided by village elders and religious leaders, handle tasks like infrastructure development, religious festivals, and cultural events, promoting community ownership and participation. Amid discussions on the country’s economy, challenges persist due to factors like the impact of past conflicts and the unregulated proliferation of microfinance institutions. The absence of legal frameworks and regulatory oversight, coupled with the lack of Central Bank registration, has led individuals to seek loans from microfinance institutions, exacerbating economic challenges. To address this, there is a need to establish a dedicated regulatory body, separate from the Central Bank, to oversee and govern microfinance institutions. Comprehensive laws are being introduced to regulate these entities and ensure responsible practices, contributing to the nation’s economic stability,” he said. "

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

The report stated that the Department of Meteorology has mentioned ongoing investigations by the Police and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). Following these revelations, the Auditor General recommends recovering the complete loss of the failed project from the responsible officials. A senior official, from the Meteorological Department, stated that the failed radar project, initiated in 2008, with a total expenditure of Rs 402 million (Rs 323 million from the World Meteorological Organisation), resulted in a government loss of Rs 78 million. He revealed that an official had advised against bringing the non-functional machine to Sri Lanka before the project began. The prolonged preparation of the road to the site, along with a crane collapse and subsequent damage, led to the destruction of some equipment and the disappearance of the rest. In a Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) meeting, held on 10 August, chaired by Minister of State Lasantha Alagiyawanna, it was emphasised that the Department of Meteorology needs to focus on implementing effective projects for accurate forecasts with modern technology instead of ventures causing significant losses.

Accordingly, 148 military officers including 25 military officers from foreign countries and 123 military officers from Sri Lanka participated in the DSCSC course held in 2022. “In accordance with any other Defence Staff College in the Commonwealth Nations, the Secretary of Defence, Chief of the Defence Staff and Tri Forces Commanders conduct lectures every year on national security to student officers which is an integral part of this DSCSC course. These lectures are done on separate occasions due to the nature of the duties and the practical issues of conducting the lectures on one occasion. Thus, such lectures were conducted on 5 separate occasions. “It is a military norm for the Defence Secretary, Chief of Defence Staff or the Commanders of the Armed Forces to have refreshments at the conclusion of their lecture with the participants of about 200 personnel which may include student officers, directing and permanent staff members providing an opportunity to expand their knowledge.  “Thus, it shall be noted that such expenditures are not incurred only to host the Secretary of Defence, Chief of Defence Staff or the Tri Forces Commanders and such media reports may mislead public perception.” The media reports were based on a National Audit Report DEF/DSCSC/22/04 published by the National Audit Office and submitted in Parliament on 28 November which stated: “In contravention of Treasury circulars outlining expenditure limitations amid the current crisis in the country, the Defence Service Command and Staff College (DSCSC) has spent Rs 1,144,658 as entertainment expenses (food and refreshment) on Defence Ministry Secretary, Chief of Defence Staff and three Commanders of the Army, Navy and the Air Force in five days.”"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/05/attempts-to-import-bermuda-grass-raise-concerns/,Attempts to import bermuda grass raise concerns,Author not found,0,2023-12-04T20:32:00+00:00," An attempt by certain parties, backed by a businessman involved in poultry business, to import Bermuda grass for ‘research purposes’ has raised concerns with environmentalists and activists questioning the rationale behind the attempt. The interested parties have claimed that this variety is to be imported from the USA for research purposes, as it is deemed to be highly effective as fodder and would increase the livestock yield especially as Sri Lanka is planning on popularising local liquid milk production.  They also allege that all key government agencies, who are authorised to permit the importation of plants, were against the move and had initially refused to grant permission, are now under immense political pressure to reconsider their initial objections.    Ceylon Today was able to acquire a letter, sent by the National Plant Quarantine Service, of the Department of Agriculture, to the Conservater General of Forests, earlier in October, for his consideration ofn the import application submitted by the Director of the Veterinary Research Institute, Peradeniya to bring down Tifton 85 Bermuda Grass. Interestingly, the letter observed that Cynodonspp is an invasive species and the requested party has placed the application for permission on the basis of conducting research to explore the potential of pasture to increase milk production in the country. “The NPQSD in their letter has requested to reconsider the permit on the mere purpose of this importation notwithstanding this being an invasive species. The points made in the letter makes one wonder if the officials were forwarding these reconsideration letters to one another due to political pressure they were put under,” a group of environmentalists, who want to drag this to the notice of those in decision-making level, allege. Environmentalists pointed out that Tifton 85 Bermuda grass can be invasive, especially in warm climates with well-drained soils.  “It is a hybrid of two other Bermuda grasses, Coastal Bermuda grass and Tifton 68 Bermuda grass, and it has inherited the aggressive growth habits of both of its parents. Tifton 85 spreads rapidly by both rhizomes (underground stems) and stolons (above-ground stems) and it can quickly outcompete other plants in an area. Tifton 85 is also very drought-tolerant and can survive in low-fertility soils. This makes it a popular choice for lawns and pastures in many parts of the country. However, it can also become a problem in natural areas and agricultural fields, where it can displace native plants and crops,” they pointed out.  There are a few things that can be done to control Tifton 85 Bermuda grass, such as: Mowing regularly: Mowing can help to slow the spread of Tifton 85 Bermuda grass to prevent it from producing seed. Herbicides: There are a few herbicides that can be used to control Tifton 85 Bermudagrass, but they should be used with caution and according to the label directions. Physical removal: Tifton 85 Bermudagrass can also be removed physically by digging up the rhizomes and stolons. However, this can be difficult and time-consuming, especially if the grass has spread over a large area. Meanwhile, when the Biodiversity Secretariat was contacted on the matter, an official said once they get a request letter such request will be given to an expert committee to do an assessment of potential threats.  “Bringing plants from an alien environment means it is bringing foreign soil, flora and fauna and various other bacterial funguses as well. Once an invasive plant enters our eco system it only creates problems in our eco system. This is why we need to be extremely careful,” the official added. As per the National Early Warning System for Invasive Alien Species (Pre-entry risk assessment), risks are assessed under four main categories. These include potential ecological and socio economic impacts, assessment of invasive potential, distribution and management aspects. Professor Siril Wijesundara, when contacted to inquire about the claims made by environmentalists, said any plant species, be it a member of the grass family or otherwise, should be imported under Director General of Agriculture following the provisions stated in the Plant Quarantine Act. He also lamented the fact that local experts and researchers were not paying attention to develop grass varieties from what is locally available despite the country having thebest scientists in the field. “Paddy is also from the grass family and how many varieties have we developed. These were done through research and development by the utilising the skills and knowledge of local scientists. We have developed paddy varieties with higher yield and these were done in Bathalegoda or Mahailuppallama. Have you ever heard of us importing seed paddy varieties to the country with better yield in the past one or two decades? No, because we have done enough research. Despite being self-sufficient we still import rice, but that is due to a completely different game by the mill owners,” he added. Prof. Wijesundara said that it is pathetic that our experts resort to the easy way out and go after wrong targets. “This is the same thing that happened with organic fertiliser. Without following proper and systematic procedure few insisted on implementing these policies without a cost assessment and that too with the involvement of complete outsiders who have no expertise in the relevant period. If the livestock industry is genuinely interested in increasing milk production or anything else, why don’t they invest in research and find grass varieties locally available to be developed as fodder?” he queried.   Even though Bermuda grass is to be imported under the guise of research purposes on a comparatively small land area, is Sri Lanka known to be equipped with better management and follow-up of such lands and plants? Are the parties involved 100% positive about the grass not becoming invasive by the time research ends?  By Gagani Weerakoon"

In summary, the National Higher Education Conference served as a platform to celebrate and recognise the profound impact of TNEs in shaping the educational landscape of Sri Lanka. The event highlighted the necessity of continued collaboration between local and international entities to ensure a robust and globally competitive higher education sector."

The educational structure would include four years of pre-school education, Grades 1-5 as the primary section, Grades 6-8 as the junior section, and Grades 9-12 as the senior section. As part of the reforms, the Ministry of Education suggested a certain percentage of marks from school-based evaluations and exams for the Grade 5 Scholarship exam. There was also a proposal to simplify the Grade 5 Scholarship exam and eliminate competition. Additionally, the new reforms proposed conducting the Ordinary Level examination in Grade 10, while the Advanced Level examination is scheduled for Grade 12. The number of subjects for O/Ls would be reduced from nine to seven, including the introduction of three new mandatory subjects: Information and Communication Technology (ICT), technical and professional skills and religion and values. The officials highlighted that, under the new reforms, no child would fail and those passing the ordinary level examination would have the opportunity to pursue vocational training courses. A-level subjects were classified into academic and vocational education, providing a path for every child to obtain a degree. Administrative restructuring in the education service was also emphasised, with an increase in the number of educational zones from 100 to 122 and the classification of the existing 10,126 schools into cluster schools of 1220. All existing national schools would become flagship schools in a provincial-level cluster. The Ministry allocated Rs 517.05 billion for the year 2024 budget, with funds allocated for school textbooks, uniforms, and shoes. Additionally, provisions were made for providing lunch to an increased number of school children."

In another bizarre move, the purchase of 30 black colour dining chairs for the hostel, costing Rs 350250 left unused in the DSCSC warehouse as the colour was deemed unsuitable and mismatched to the ambience of the hostel. Furthermore, the audit reveals that contributions for civilian staff at DSCSC from 2009 to 31 August 2022, have not been remitted to the Employees’ Trust Fund, with outstanding contributions for 64 current employees amounting to Rs 7.58 million.  The procurement of a heavy-duty photocopier for DSCSC saw a discrepancy, with the machine acquired at Rs 2.2 million instead of its listed price of Rs 1.6 million, resulting in a loss of Rs 600,000 in the procurement process. The audit report also notes a delay in the procurement process for the heavy-duty copier due to a lack of specifications tailored to the needs of DSCSC, contributing to the higher acquisition cost. Additionally, a four storey library and examination hall building, constructed at a cost of Rs 133 millions for the college, reportedly suffered substantial damage to its electrical system and upper-floor walls due to water leakage. Despite the issues dating back to 2019, there has been no restoration. In summary, the total expenditure for the staff college in 2022, dedicated to enhancing the professional knowledge of selected Student Officers from the tri-forces and Police, amounted to Rs 171 million.

He said climate action is not the sole responsibility of a single nation and called on the international community to join hands in this endeavour.

It was also disclosed that although the country generates 938 MT of plastic daily, only 32 per cent is collected, with a mere 4 per cent undergoing mechanical recycling. Officials said uncollected plastic is disposed of into the environment. It was brought to light that industrialists have been permitted to import secondary plastic without proper regulation. In response, the Sectoral Oversight Committee directed the Central Environment Authority to issue licences based on industry requirements in the future. Considering this, the chairman recommended aligning permission with industry needs and setting up a system to collect imported plastic within a specified five-year period. Officials also informed the committee that high cost deters many from collecting plastic for recycling. In response, the committee chairman suggested increasing incentives for plastic collection to boost collection. He also said the importance of setting up dedicated collection centres across the island was vital.

Effie Sri Lanka, a branch of Effie Worldwide, recognised the 10-part series ‘Ata Pass,’ presented on Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok social media platforms in October 2022, at a ceremony held on  28 November in Colombo. The series featured Sri Lankan actors and received more than 6 million views. A complementary campaign directed youth to call centres set up by YouLead in Sinhala and Tamil generated more than 16,000 leads from youth seeking career testing and one-on-one professional career guidance. ‘Ata Pass’ won a total of four individual awards, including gold in the Data-Driven Marketing category, silver in Non-Profit/Pro-Bono, silver in Social Good Non-Profit and bronze in Youth Marketing.  In addition, YouLead received the night’s top two awards – Most Effective Brand of the Year and Most Effective Marketer of the Year – based on the judges’ overall votes. The drama was also emphasised in a widely-played video game. Eight renowned gaming influencers, each embodying one of the ‘Ata Pas’ characters, collectively garnered over 100,000 views in a single 24-hour streaming period. Additionally, the game version secured finalist positions in two Effie categories. ‘Ata Pass’ was a countermeasure to vexing issues facing Sri Lankan youth. The Census Bureau estimates youth unemployment at 24 per cent. Meanwhile, at least 300,000 youth emigrated abroad for economic reasons in 2023 alone. ‘Ata Pass’ aimed to address misconceptions regarding education and careers. The series encouraged youth, empowering them with the right tools and resources to make informed, proactive choices about their own career paths. “We are delighted that this innovative and creative campaign inspired so many youth to seek proper guidance on potential careers here,” said USAID Mission Director Gabriel Grau. “Many Sri Lankan youth see their opportunities in foreign countries, but ‘Ata Pass’ provided them with the insight and understanding of the possibilities afforded to them by employing their talents in Sri Lanka.” ‘Ata Pass’ was conceptualised by the Audacity advertising firm and the campaign was implemented together with ADA Sri Lanka, K&D Media, and Isobar Sri Lanka. The awards come on the heels of four other awards for digital excellence given earlier in November to the Ata Pass/Grand Theft Auto campaign by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

During a media briefing at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), the State Minister emphasised a historic collaboration with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). A fund of Rs 30 billion has been allocated under the small loan scheme for enterprise development, providing entrepreneurs with the initial capital required and a 2 per cent loan interest relief. Ranaweera further said, “Fostering the growth of entrepreneurs, constituting 2.8 per cent of our country’s total population, is a responsibility bestowed upon us. Between 2024 and 2028, our objectives include elevating the entrepreneur count to 10 per cent. Presently, initiatives are underway to cultivate micro, small and medium-scale entrepreneurs within this demographic. To achieve this, extensive collaborative efforts have been initiated with the institutions under the Ministry. Additionally, over 200,000 children enter the job market following the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examination, facing limited opportunities. Our aim is to empower them to become entrepreneurs. We also aspire to uplift children who take to the streets with three-wheelers, vending by offering essential knowledge and training, providing them with an opportunity for a better future. For the first time in history, a groundbreaking initiative has been undertaken in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank, allocating Rs 30 billion under the small loan scheme for enterprise development. The focus is on providing essential initial capital under a 2 per cent loan interest concession. President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s vision is to transform the present generation into entrepreneurs, aligning them with the demands of the modern world. Moreover, the global market is prepared to allocate 789 billion for handicrafts in the fiscal year 2024-2025. Securing just 1 per cent of this market share for our country would be a significant accomplishment.”"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/04/india-yet-to-fulfil-treaty-obligations/,India yet to fulfil treaty obligations,Author not found,0,2023-12-03T20:31:00+00:00,"Though half a century has lapsed since India signed the Indo-Sri Lankan agreements (Sirimavo-Shastri Pact of 1964 and Sirima-Gandhi Pact of 1974) to resolve the status of Indian Origin Tamils (IOT) in Sri Lanka, the Indian Government has still not fulfilled its treaty obligations, observed the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Thursday. “While India was obliged to repatriate and grant citizenship to not less than six lakh IOTs from Sri Lanka, as of date only 4,61,639 IOTs have been conferred with Indian citizenship,” said Justice GR Swaminathan. Pointing out that Article 51 of the Indian Constitution mandates that the State should endeavour to foster respect for treaty obligations in the dealings of organised people with one another, the judge opined that India will have to confer citizenship on not less than 1,37,000 IOTs to fulfil the above agreements. The judge made the observations while passing orders on a petition filed by one T Ganesan seeking Indian Citizenship. After 33 years of being called a ‘refugee’ in his own land, the 70-year-old repatriate from Sri Lanka finally gets a new lease of life, thanks to the judge, who directed the Indian government to recognise Ganesan’s status as an ‘Indian Citizen’ and ordered rehabilitation of him and his family. Speaking to TNIE, Ganesan’s advocate Romeo Roy Alfred said the order is an important milestone that sheds light on the Indian Origin Tamils who are living in the tag of refugees in their motherland. “There are 104 refugee camps in Tamil Nadu, with over 57,000 Sri Lankan. Besides them, 34,000 refugees live outside the camps. At least half of the refugees inside the camp and 80% of the refugees living outside the camps could be Indian Origin Tamils,” Alfred claims. Even if all these people were given Indian Citizenship, it would still be short of the figure which was agreed upon and left unfulfilled by the Indian Government in the 1964 and 1974 agreements, he added. He further stated that recently, a preliminary survey was conducted by the government in the refugee camps to identify IOTs and even as per the preliminary data, nearly 5,130 inmates were found to belong to IOT category. He urged the Central and State governments to conduct a full-fledged survey to identify IOTs and confer Indian Citizenship on them. Only then, people like Ganesan who got abandoned by the Indian government’s suspension of the repatriation attempts due to the Black July genocide and were forced to spend decades of their life in refugee camps in their own soil, would get justice, he added. He also expressed hope that the present order will strengthen the pathways for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees who are longing for decades to attain Indian Citizenship. Ganesan was born in 1954 to an Indian-origin Tamil family which was engaged in tea plantation work in Sri Lanka. He had applied for a passport in 1970 when he was 16 years old. However, the Attache/Assistant High Commission of India, Kandy issued a passport to him only on 22 August, 1982. Since the Indian government had temporarily stopped the repatriation mission in 1984, Ganesan and his family had to flee to India on their own efforts in 1990. However, the Indian government refused to acknowledge Ganesan’s status as ‘Indian Citizen’. Though they accepted that his passport was genuine, they stated that the photograph on the passport was of a far younger person (a photo submitted by Ganesan at the time of applying) and told him to bring conclusive evidence to prove that the document was issued to him. Due to this, Ganesan was unable to prove his citizenship and has been living in the refugee camp in Karur with his family, including grandchildren, for the past 33 years. Justice Swaminathan observed, “Issuance of passport is a sovereign act. When the genuineness of the passport is not in doubt, the exercise of matching the photograph found therein with the claimant has to be undertaken only by the authority concerned. This burden cannot be shifted to the applicant.” He directed the government to recognise Ganesan and his family members as Indian Citizens and provide them with the relief and rehabilitation measures announced by the government for repatriates like him.

Speaking further, he pointed out that there has been a concerning surge in the spread of AIDS in the country over the past few years, with reports of approximately 6,000 patients.  In 2022 alone, 600 individuals infected with AIDS were identified.  The former State Minister also highlighted the alarming statistics that one AIDS patient is reported for every 3,000 persons in Sri Lanka, emphasising the need for thorough screening and monitoring in response to the potential health risks associated with the substandard medicine. Sri Lanka’s National Sexually Transmitted Diseases (NSTD)/AIDS Control Programme recently said it has faced challenges in meeting UNAIDS and Global Development Goals targets due to the reluctance of potential vulnerable groups to access their services, driven by fears of discrimination and stigma. The programme Director Dr. Janaki Vidanapathirana emphasised that HIV testing is crucial in achieving the ambitious goal of ending AIDS by 2030, with UNAIDS recommending the 95-95-95 targets by 2025 for any country committed to this objective.  This entails ensuring that 95 per cent of people living with HIV are aware of their HIV status. Dr. Vidanapathirana stressed the need for creating an environment where individuals feel comfortable testing themselves without the fear of judgment.

Consequently, the closure of the New Kelani Bridge will occur in three phases to facilitate essential modernisation activities.  The closure of the New Kelani Bridge will take place in three distinct phases, each characterized by specific timeframes. Phase 01 is scheduled from 9.00 p.m. today (1) to 6.00 a.m. on 4 December. Following this, Phase 02 will take place from 9.00 p.m. on 8 December to 6.00 a.m. on 11 December (Monday).

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Residents of Rambawewa have brought this pressing issue to the notice of the authorities concerned, but they charged to date no concrete measures had been taken to address the matter.  These residents charged that the Kahatagasdigiliya PS and its Garbage Disposal and Management Unit are not operating to the satisfaction of the masses, resulting in the mounting garbage.  Further, they alleged that the Garbage Unit affiliated with the said PS is not being maintained according to the required standards, complicating matters. They said for several years, garbage and waste matter have been dumped in Boralukanda by the PS officers and due to this reason, villagers had abstained from using the Boralukanda River for daily needs as its water had become polluted.  These persons said due to the crass actions of the said PS, some 400 families in the area had faced untold hardship and they alleged that despite the matters being brought to the attention of the officials concerned, there was no improvement in their situation. They pointed out that the Garbage Unit attached to the PS has become a white elephant, with no tangible service being rendered by it towards the public.  They noted that garbage is also consumed by wild elephants, birds, monkeys and stray dogs and tends to get mixed with their well water, resulting in health hazards to both elders and young alike. They added that the consumption of garbage by these animals had posed a serious risk to their health and lamented that the matter has continued to worsen. Secretary of the PS concerned, P.R. Inoka Priyadarshani said, to date no official complaint had been lodged with them regarding any haphazard disposal of garbage to the mountaintop. However, she agreed that the garbage that is disposed of tends to be consumed by wild animals and that it could pose a threat to them.  She also rejected the charge that the garbage collected was being released in an ad-hoc manner. She said the shortage of staff at the Garbage Unit had somewhat hampered their work when it comes to the disposal of the garbage but stressed that every possible precaution was taken to prevent health hazards and lasting damage to the environment. She also assured that all shortcomings would be addressed by the PS within a week.  By G.C.K. Balasuriya "

Alahapperuma submitted a question for Oral Answers on this issue, and he is scheduled to receive a response only in late January 2024.  Expressing concern about the significant delays in resolving complaints by the Bribery Commission, Alahapperuma sought clarification from Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana. He highlighted the passage of the new Anti-Corruption Act in Parliament this year as a positive step.  However, he noted a substantial issue regarding the failure to appoint new commissioners to the Bribery Commission. He emphasised the urgency of these appointments and questioned when they would take place. In response, the Speaker informed Parliament that the matter has been addressed at the Constitutional Council (CC), and steps will be taken to make the appointments soon. The delay of appointing new commissioners to the Bribery Commission was criticised by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament last week as well.  The President in a strong statement said, “We enacted the Anti-Corruption Act, and for the past three months, I have been awaiting the appointment of new Commissioners to the Bribery Commission. Despite our ongoing efforts to address corruption, the appointment of Commission members is facing delays due to concerns raised by a few individuals. We have consulted with the Attorney General, urging that even if there are minor issues, the names should be forwarded for appointments. I am prepared to confront any legal challenges and if our commitment to eliminating corruption is sincere, we could have proceeded with these appointments.” The Speaker, who responded to the President, said the delay was caused due to an error in the 22nd Amendment where the Constitutional Council was mistakenly referred to as the Constitutional Board. This error caused the delay in appointing members to the Bribery Commission and the matter will be resolved within two weeks. By Methmalie Dissanayake  "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/11/29/farmers-trust-fund-fails-to-utilise-rs-5-4b-for-farmers-welfare/,Farmers’ Trust Fund fails to utilise Rs 5.4B for farmers’ welfare,Author not found,0,2023-11-28T20:36:00+00:00," Contrary to the primary objective of introducing the ‘Govisetha’ lottery, designed to generate funds for the Farmers’ Trust Fund, the administration of the fund has failed to utilise a substantial sum of Rs 5.4 billion remitted to the fund over the past 28 years, since the lottery’s introduction.  A senior official at National Lotteries Board (NLB) told Ceylon Today although a portion of the Govisetha lottery income was credited to the Farmers’ Trust Fund, it was not utilised for its intended purposes. Instead, the funds were consistently invested in Fixed Deposits and Treasury Bills. NLB introduced the Govisetha lottery in 1995 on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands to generate funds for the Farmers’ Trust Fund. The fund aims to promote agriculture and the welfare of the farmers and to provide financial assistance to the farmers whenever necessary.  From 1995 to 2022, 10 per cent of the lottery income, totalling Rs 6.3 billion, was credited to a consolidated fund of the Treasury. However, only Rs 956 million was utilised for the implementation of the Farmers’ Trust Fund’s functions and tasks by the administration of the fund. Thus, the official said, the Rs 5.4 million which should have been utilised for the well-being of the farmers in the country has been continually invested in fixed deposits and treasury bills. Additionally, the official said at the end of the previous year (2022), Rs 465 million was invested in fixed deposits, Rs 90 million in treasury bills and the interest income earned amounted to Rs 73 million. Citing the challenging economic situation in the country, the Board of Directors of the Farmers’ Trust Fund has decided not to implement new projects, leading to the non-execution of planned projects. However, the official emphasised that the fund’s money, invested in fixed deposits and generating interest income, will be utilised for development and loan programmes in the future.  Despite the present situation, the official assured that development and welfare programmes are scheduled to be implemented in the coming years.  The trust deed specifies that the fund’s primary source of income is 10 per cent of the sales revenue from the Govisetha lottery, subject to discussions and decisions with the National Lotteries Board. Cabinet Paper No. 95/1317/105/081 stated that 10 per cent of the Govisetha lottery income should be remitted to the Farmers’ Trust Fund through a consolidated fund maintained by the Treasury.  Established with the goal of enhancing agricultural development and farmers’ welfare, the fund provides short-term agricultural credit facilities to smallholder farmers, organises agricultural inputs and offers support for crop and animal production processes.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/11/29/immunoglobulin-iv-scam-probe-punishes-honest-officials/,Immunoglobulin IV scam probe punishes honest officials,Author not found,0,2023-11-28T20:33:00+00:00," Despite revealing the real fraudsters behind the Immunoglobulin IV scam, the officials who only followed the instructions given by the Health Ministry are being punished unjustly, alleged the Association of Medical Administrators (AMA).  The AMA called for honest and transparent investigations into the immunoglobulin IV scam in order to arrest and bring to justice the real fraudsters.  AMA Secretary Dr. Priyantha Karunaratne lamented that the scam had occurred as a result of a group having deliberately acted fraudulently during the whole Emergency Purchase process. Instead of studying the place or the process of the criminal act, the ongoing investigation on this issue was trying to trace the methodological mistakes, made by officials in the last stage of the process and were attempting to place the whole criminal charge on them.  Dormant policy related to the procurement board process, technical appraisal committee and the role of the NMRA had mainly given rise to this fraud, he alleged.  Dr. Karunaratne, yesterday (28), said however that if health officers just doing their job were to be pursued and imprisoned on criminal charges their mentality would only be broken.  “The legal investigation was initiated into irregularities in the purchase of the controversial Human Immunoglobulin. Officers were arrested and remanded including the Director of the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) Dr. Kapila Wickremanayake,” he said.  Dr. Karunaratne, explaining the procedure of emergency purchasing, said that after confirming the need for urgent purchase, the order was given to the State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC), which acted as the drug purchasing agency to the Health Ministry and they followed the procurement procedures to deliver the order to the MSD. A waiver of registration (WOR) was issued to the import controller, if the Medicine was not registered with the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) which authorises the importation of the medicine.  The WOR was given to the import controller “allowing limited permission to the relevant supplier to bring the medicine into Sri Lanka.”   The medicines ordered this way were cleared by the customs and given to the MSD by the supplier. He said that at the time of importing human immunoglobulin, the drug in question, Sri Lanka had been facing a severe economic crisis and had not had the sufficient forex to import essential materials such as medicine and fuel.  The government had taken a decision to purchase more than 180 other drugs, including the particular medicinal drug which created the controversy, under the Indian Credit line (ICL).   The AMA Secretary said, however that the normal procurement partners the SPC had informed the Health Ministry that it was difficult for them to purchase these medicines under the conditions of the ICL, which had led to a series of decisions taken by the Cabinet, the State Ministry Production, Supply and Regulation of Pharmaceuticals and the Health Ministry. The procurement process commenced.  The NMRA, the Procurement Committee, the Technical Evaluation Committee have great responsibility in this regard.  Once the MSD received the final import of the medicinal drugs, they had distributed it by checking them with the documents on the decisions issued by the Procurement and Technical Committees, he said noting that the lab facility of the NMRA had minimal resources to contribute to the process of quality testing of imported drugs.  BY Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The President stressed the imperative of innovative thinking and collaboration within the industry to ensure sustainable growth. President Wickremesinghe declared, “When I took over the government, I realised that sustainability alone is not sufficient. How are we going to earn foreign exchange? How are we going to have a positive balance of trade? In that, there were many suggestions. But what is the low-hanging fruit? And one of the low-hanging fruits was tourism. Let’s promote tourism fully.” Recognising the need to move beyond existing frameworks and embrace competition to elevate Sri Lanka’s global tourism standing, the President drew comparisons with countries like Vietnam and questioned why they attracted more tourists despite being in the industry for a shorter period. He underscored the importance of increasing the number of tourists to 2.5 million in the upcoming year and expanding on this figure subsequently. Central to the President’s vision is the enhancement of the tourism product, urging the industry to specialise and tap into Sri Lanka’s unexplored potential. President Wickremesinghe emphasised the need for a nuanced approach to promotion, drawing inspiration from historical practices during the Anuradhapura period. President Wickremesinghe remarked, “Look at our food. From one area to another. Have you utilised it? Let’s do that. We have to be special in many ways. You remember, tourism was not something that was new to us. It was there even in the time of the Anuradhapura period.” Acknowledging the role of hospitality in attracting and retaining tourists, the President stressed the necessity for a comprehensive experience, encompassing accommodation, cuisine, and cultural offerings. He proposed the diversification and improvement of Sri Lankan cuisine, advocating for a fusion of local and international flavours to cater to diverse tastes. Highlighting the potential for collaboration with expatriates to enhance the industry further, President Wickremesinghe underscored the significance of niche markets, citing golf tourism as an example. The President’s address also focused on the development of tourism infrastructure beyond traditional attractions. He outlined plans for transforming Colombo into an entertainment hub, emphasising the need for diverse activities to engage visitors. Addressing the issue of minimum rates, President Wickremesinghe advocated for a shift towards higher rates, emphasising the need for a quality product that justifies the cost. He encouraged the industry to embrace a new mindset to achieve the ambitious target of 5 million tourists. “In this new era, we need new thinking. We can’t get there with the old mindset. Just forget it and put it aside. Think of the new people who will come. Then we can achieve our five million,” President Wickremesinghe asserted. The President concluded by expressing confidence in the industry’s ability to achieve the 5 million tourist target and urged stakeholders to aim higher, setting a goal of 7.5 million with higher-paying tourists. He emphasised the importance of maximising earnings and attracting tourists from both domestic and international markets without unnecessary restrictions. During the event, President Wickremesinghe honoured two stalwarts of the hotel industry, presenting lifetime achievement awards to Srilal Miththapala and Hiran Cooray for their significant contributions. Key government figures, including Minister of Tourism, Lands, Sports, and Youth Affairs Harin Fernando, Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism and Lands H.M.P.B. Herath, and officials from the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka, as well as experts in the hotel industry, attended the event. The PMD suggests that as Sri Lanka embarks on this transformative journey to position itself as a premier tourist destination, President Wickremesinghe’s vision sets the stage for a dynamic and prosperous future for the country’s tourism sector."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Hours after Ranasinghe’s allegations, he was sacked from both his ministerial portfolios, by the President under the powers vested in him according to the Section 47 (3) (a) of the Constitution. It is said the letter conveying the sacking was handed over to Ranasinghe during yesterday’s (27) Cabinet meeting held in Parliament.  In the evening Ministers Harin Fernando and Pavithra Wanniarachchi were sworn in as Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs and Minister of Irrigation respectively.  Ranasinghe, in Parliament, said he received an alleged warning from MP Namal Rajapaksa about potential dangers to his life. He claimed that Namal Rajapaksa cautioned him to be alert, describing President Wickremesinghe as vindictive. MP Rajapaksa, however, refuted the claim, emphasising that parliamentary privileges should not be exploited to make such statements. “Standing orders should be amended to prevent MPs from making such utterances,” Namal Rajapaksa asserted. In response, Ranasinghe contended that the message was relayed to him by MP Rajapaksa through a third party. Regarding accusations from President Ranil Wickremesinghe about tarnishing the reputation of the judiciary, Ranasinghe defended himself, saying that he only mentioned a specific judicial officer and challenged the accusations of insulting the judiciary. He detailed a series of challenges he faced in establishing businesses across multiple countries, asserting his commitment to legal practices. He then exposed an alleged irregularity involving Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), claiming that SLC spent Rs 234 million on a LED screen estimated to cost Rs 9.7 million. He asserted that his efforts to uncover such frauds within SLC have resulted in him being unfairly targeted. Speaking further, Ranasinghe suggested that the cricket-related issues would likely be resolved after the next presidential election, indicating that a swift resolution was not anticipated. Meanwhile, there are allegations that the President removed Ranasinghe from his portfolios due to the former’s inability to provide satisfactory answers to two questions posed by the President. These inquiries reportedly revolve around Ranasinghe’s alleged connections with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) concerning cricket matters and the purported distribution of Mahaweli lands to his supporters and relatives. In the aftermath of Sri Lanka Men’s National Cricket Team’s disheartening loss to India at the ICC Men’s World Cup 2023, Ranasinghe has been in a contentious relationship with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and its President Shammi Silva. Following the team’s dismal performance, Ranasinghe took decisive action by dismissing the cricket governing body, led by Shammi Silva and appointing an interim committee. This committee, comprising seven members, was headed by the former cricket captain Arjuna Ranatunga. However, the ICC promptly suspended SLC, citing government interference and Silva secured a Court order suspending the interim committee. Accusing Silva and other SLC board members of orchestrating the ban from the ICC, Ranasinghe labelled it a “significant betrayal of the country.” In response, SLC initiated a defamation lawsuit against Ranasinghe, intensifying the administrative turmoil within the country. The crisis brewing within SLC then escalated into a conflict between the President and Ranasinghe, when the President thwarted Ranasinghe’s attempt to establish the Interim Cricket. The President said that neither the government nor he knew anything about the appointment of an interim committee for SLC. Afterwards, the President appointed a Cabinet Sub-Committee, led by Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry to oversee SLC operations.  Following this, Ranasinghe launched a verbal attack on the President in Parliament, accusing him of instructing him to disband the interim committee.

In response to those allegations, Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Dr. Anil Jasinghe, told Ceylon Today that the 80+ delegation comprises three distinct groups: the Political Delegation, Technical Delegation and the Overflow Delegation. While Dr. Jasinghe refrained from commenting on the political delegation, he explained that the technical delegation consists of 24 individuals, with 11 delegates from the Ministry of Environment and seven climate change experts. Of the 11 government-funded delegates, only three are supported by the Sri Lankan Government; the remaining seven experts are self-funded and the rest of the technical delegation is funded by organisations such as the UN Environment Program and WHO. Dr. Jasinghe clarified that the overflow delegation comprises 20 youth delegates funded by organisations like the British Council, UNICEF, and SLYCAN Trust. These youth representatives were chosen by the funding organisations, not the government. Additionally, over 40 businessmen are part of the overflow delegation, attending the summit to discuss and attract potential investments to Sri Lanka. During yesterday’s parliamentary sittings (27), Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya questioned the affordability of such a large delegation attending COP28, especially at a time when the government faces criticism for unregulated spending and is imposing increased taxes on the general public amid economic hardships. Dr. Amarasuriya also raised concerns about the qualifications of the Sri Lankan delegation, alleging that the government is leveraging this platform to greenwash its numerous flaws and appease the international community.

The ramifications of this healthcare upheaval are profound, casting a shadow over the accessibility and quality of medical services for the populace. These revelations came to the light during a meeting between Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana and the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA).  Accordingly, the Health Minister instructed the officials of his Ministry to immediately assign medical practitioners in countrywide hospitals that were closed and about to be closed due to the shortage of doctors.  A senior spokesman for the Health Ministry said yesterday (27) Dr. Pathirana instructed officials, during his meeting with representatives from the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday (27), to take the necessary steps to re-start the hospitals that were closed or about to be closed to start patient care services. The Spokesman said that Dr. Pathirana  had issued instructions to his officials to form a Committee Chaired by the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) and inclusive of representatives from the GMOA to expedite the procedure of appointing the necessary medical practitioners to these hospitals so that patient care could be resumed.  Meanwhile, Media Committee Member of the GMOA, Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe said they had also discussed issues regarding the transfer, training and assigning doctors to hospitals based on service requirement, transfers of medical administrative officers were also discussed. Transfers and appointments of Consultants, Grade and Administrative Grade Medical Officers were also taken up, he said. There are 6,000 unimplemented transfers.   He said that the meeting had ended on a positive note while the Minister had instructed his officials to resolve the transfer issues of medical practitioners.    Acting Health Secretary Dr. Sunil de Alwis, Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena, Deputy Director General (Laboratory Services) Dr. Sudath Dharmaratne, Director (Tertiary Services) Dr. Priyantha Athapatthu, Director (Medical Services)  Dr. Priyantha Karunaratne and  GMOA Representatives Dr. Darshana Sirisena (President) and  Dr. Haritha Aluthge (Secretary) were also present.

Compensation distribution for crop damage in the Walawa-Mahaweli zone, severely affected by water scarcity in the previous Yala season, commenced on Sunday (26). The ceremony, held at the D.A. Rajapaksa Memorial Hall in Embilipitiya, saw the participation of Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, Mahinda Amaraweera. Minister Amaraweera revealed that 16,500 acres of land, cultivated by 15,000 farmers in the Walawa Zone, incurred damage, prompting the government to allocate Rs 3,628 million for compensation. Nationwide, a total of 65,000 acres of paddy cultivation was destroyed during the last Yala season drought, with an additional 11,000 acres affected by subsequent rains. This brings the total affected paddy fields to 76,000 acres. Minister Amaraweera emphasised that the government, in a historic move, allocated 5.5 billion rupees, the largest sum ever designated for crop damage compensation. The compensation event, attended by Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, and Member of Parliament, Akila Ellawala, featured Minister Amaraweera expressing gratitude and outlining the swift compensation process. Minister Amaraweera stated, “Compensation will be given today to 1,030 farmers who suffered crop damage. The Walawa Zone is one of the highest rice-yielding areas in our country. Normally, compensation for crop damage takes about a year. But the government decided to provide crop damage compensation two months before the end of the cropping season, a first in history. I am thankful to the government led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, which provided the financial allocation for this.” Minister of Wildlife and Forest Conservation Pavithra Wanniarachchi, expressed appreciation to Minister Amaraweera for expediting compensation and highlighted his persistent efforts in securing Cabinet approval. She noted that without Minister Amaraweera’s dedication, the swift provision of compensation would not have been possible. The Chairman of the Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board, W.M. M. B. Weerasekera, also participated in the event."

D. Wijewardene, the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security and other officials and senior Police officers.  During the meeting, chairman of the committee Rear Admiral (retired) Sarath Weerasekara, emphasised that the general public is experiencing inconveniences due to certain private individuals being escorted by private security guards. In response, senior Police officers, present at the meeting, said that the Police cannot intervene in the personal security of an individual due to the lack of legal provisions. The committee members decided to inform the Ministry of Defence to establish criteria for regulating private security services, especially considering that these private security personnel possess lethal weapons, exacerbating the inconveniences caused by their entourages. There was also a lengthy discussion in the committee about the growth of underworld activities. It was also revealed in the committee that certain persons in the service of the armed forces show an increase in resorting to crime. The former IGP pointed out that there is some weakness in the identification of criminals. He further commented that if there are competent OICs to identify criminals in their areas, crime can be prevented before it happens and therefore attention has been paid to identify competent Police OICs and send them to the respective areas for service. Drug control was also discussed at length in the committee. The Police officials pointed out that the drug traffickers are working to make the schoolchildren addicted to drugs by giving them pills. They further commented that the first thing that should be done in drug control is to prevent those drugs from entering the country. The committee also discussed the need for strict enforcement of laws such as confiscation of property of drug traffickers.

Accordingly, it is expected that the reconnection fee, which is currently Rs 3,000 be revised to between Rs1,000 and Rs2,000, he added. Wijesekera highlighted the current financial deficit faced by the Electricity Board, amounting to Rs 12 billion. However, he expressed optimism about a potential positive turn in the financial outlook, as indicated in the upcoming December financial report due to the prevailing rainy conditions. The Minister further elaborated on the recent Cabinet approval to restructure the CEB based on a report that was already submitted. The proposed new Electricity Bill received approval, marking a significant step to enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of the electricity sector in line with national objectives. Efforts are underway to gazette and present the Bill in Parliament within the next two weeks. The goal is to facilitate a comprehensive debate on the proposed Bill during Sittings scheduled for January 2024. The misconceptions in Parliament regarding the configuration of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution will be discussed. He proposed restructuring power generation into four distinct companies, emphasising that the entire hydroelectricity sector, constituting 100%, will remain under Government control. The management of power plants near the Mahaweli, Laxapana and Samanalawewa will also be retained by the Government. As part of the restructuring initiative, the Norochcholai Power Plant will be consolidated under a single company, while all other power plants will be grouped together under a separate entity. This decision aims to optimise operational efficiency and enhance the overall effectiveness of the power generation sector. “The proposal includes the establishment of a distinct company dedicated to transmission work, with the main control system remaining entirely under government ownership. Further, it is suggested that the four distribution zones be transformed into four separate companies, each tasked with efficient and independent operation. This strategic proposal aims to streamline transmission and distribution, ensuring enhanced effectiveness and response within the electricity sector. The restructuring of the Electricity Board is anticipated to bring efficiency, quality and reduce wastage. The initiative takes into consideration existing laws and regulations in various countries worldwide. The implementation of the plan is scheduled to follow the submission of the draft, incorporating feedback and suggestions from various stakeholders, including experts in the relevant field. The continuity of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is expected to remain unchanged, operating in a manner consistent with current practices,” he said.  The nation has suffered the loss of numerous power plants due to delayed policy decisions and the prolonged non-implementation of previously made decisions. The proposed construction of the Sampur power plant, a project under consideration for several years, faced a significant setback when the decision was made in 2016 to forego its construction. Originally slated for completion in 2020, the non-realisation of the Sampur Power Plant has resulted in an annual loss of Rs 95 billion, he claimed.  Speaking further, the Minister said as part of the Government’s strategic initiatives, five significant projects have been identified for immediate implementation with plans to sign agreements for five more projects before the end of the year.  “These agreements include collaborations with the Adani wind power plant in Mannar, construction of a solar panel power plant in Siambalanduwa, the Hambantota solar panel project, as well as projects proposed for Batticaloa and Poonakary,” he added."

President Wickremesinghe introduced the Urumaya Freehold Deed Programme during the initial phase of the public awareness campaign as per 2024 budget proposal. The President underscored that this programme pays homage to farmers who have been the backbone of the nation for generations. President Wickremesinghe outlined the primary goals of the initiative, emphasising the transformation of each village into an enterprise village to significantly strengthen the export economy. He also disclosed plans to establish agriculture modernisation service centres to provide essential facilities supporting the growth of the agricultural industry. Speaking at a gathering in Nochchiyagama, Anuradhapura yesterday (26) the President raised a pertinent question regarding the allocation of freehold land for the Shangri-La Hotel. He questioned why a similar privilege couldn’t be extended to hardworking farmers who have cultivated the land for generations. Emphasising the potential for generating foreign exchange through strategic land allocations, he highlighted the importance of modernising the agriculture industry to bolster the export economy. A significant aspect of the programme involves allocating two billion rupees in the 2024 budget for ‘Urumaya’ freehold Deeds. President Wickremesinghe proposed a departure from existing Title Deed categories, such as Jaya Bhoomi, Saumya Bhoomi, Swarna Bhoomi, in favour of a unified freehold Deed system scheduled to be implemented in 2024. In his address, President Wickremesinghe urged unity in working for the country, transcending political differences. Reflecting on challenges faced on assuming office, he highlighted successful efforts to stabilise the country’s economic situation, steering it away from bankruptcy. The President announced plans to resume stalled development projects and emphasised the importance of safeguarding cultural and historical sites like Malwathu Oya and Maha Viharaya in Anuradhapura.

Governor of the North Central Province, Maheepala Herath, commended the President for his pivotal role in navigating Sri Lanka through legal and economic challenges. Describing the state of the law in the country as ‘wild’ at one point, Governor Herath praised the President’s acceptance of this challenge and emphasised the commendable efforts that led to the country’s economic recovery. The Governor highlighted the President’s visit to Anuradhapura and the Urumaya programme as a significant step in empowering the agricultural community. Minister of State for Finance, Shehan Semasinghe revealed that the President has included a groundbreaking provision in this year’s budget, granting freehold land rights to all citizens. Despite challenges in incorporating this proposal in the 2023 Budget due to prevailing circumstances, the President’s commitment to fulfilling the people’s need for land rights remained unwavering. Minister Semasinghe emphasised the President’s proactive measures in addressing agricultural concerns, particularly the provision of essential fertilisers to farmers, ensuring the entire requirement for yielding seasons has been met. The President’s comprehensive programme has not only established political stability but has also laid the foundation for social and economic stability in the country. He expressed satisfaction in resolving a fundamental issue faced by the people, allowing them to enjoy land with rightful ownership determined by the President’s decisive actions. MP Duminda Dissanayake expressed gratitude to President Wickremesinghe for his leadership and the implementation of the Urumaya programme, granting farmers the heritage of their great-grandfathers. Dissanayake commended the President’s political maturity, highlighting the effectiveness of this year’s budget in demonstrating the President’s thorough preparation. The MP praised the President’s decision to allocate a ten-thousand-rupee allowance to public servants, provide freehold deeds to farmers and grant tenants the rightful ownership of their houses. This, according to Dissanayake, underscores the President’s commitment to addressing the needs of various segments of society and showcases his leadership acumen. MP S.M. Chandrasena commended the President on the significant financial allocation to the Anuradhapura District in the latest budget announcement. Notably, funds have been designated for crucial projects such as the Malwatu Oya initiative and the Maha Viharaya. MP Chandrasena underscored the President’s commitment to the agricultural community by highlighting the proposal in this year’s budget to grant freehold deeds to farmers. He emphasised that these measures, aimed at providing relief to a nation grappling with economic challenges, exemplify the President’s political maturity and his dedication to addressing key issues faced by the country.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

This was revealed by Nalin Fernando, the Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food Security during the recent sittings the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Trade, Commerce, and Food Security held in Parliament. The minister highlighted a reported shortage of sugar in the local market due to the concealment of sugar stocks following the imposition of a maximum retail price. Importers have suspended sugar imports, exacerbating the distribution issues in the market. Considering the risk of a sugar shortage, the Minister announced the removal of the maximum retail price on sugar, taking various factors into account. He also announced that initiatives have been implemented to import a supply of rice similar to Keeri Samba to meet the demand for the upcoming festive season.  Expanding on this matter, Fernando said significant efforts have been made by the primary large-scale paddy mill owners in the country to address the artificial scarcity of keeri samba and samba rice. This scarcity has reportedly been created by withholding stocks without releasing them into the market. Additionally, the Minister outlined plans to establish a system that supports the business community, with a specific focus on addressing challenges faced by small and medium-scale paddy mill owners. Further, the minister commended Lanka Sathosa for successfully providing essential products to consumers at affordable prices. In an effort to offer relief to consumers during the upcoming festive season, Lanka Sathosa has taken steps to reduce prices on nearly 400 items, including essential food products.

He revealed this at a special discussion on 25 November at Sudharmalaya Temple, Galle Fort.  Previously, the Galle Heritage Foundation had spoken of its intention to impose a fee of USD 15 on foreign tourists entering the Galle Fort.  In response to this announcement, local residents of the Fort, including individuals from various business sectors and those connected to tourism, voiced their objections. They submitted a letter of protest to the Galle Heritage Foundation and initiated a black flag protest against the proposed fee. Minister Pathirana said the decision to charge a fee was not correct and had not been communicated to any authority. He confirmed that he had discussed the matter with the Minister of Buddhashasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Vidura Wickramanayake and Secretary, Somaratne Vidanapathirana. Minister Wickramanayake explicitly stated that such an initiative would not be endorsed, he added. “It is impractical to collect a fee from tourists entering the Fort and such a practice cannot be allowed. Galle Fort is a place that impacts all of us as well as the tourism industry. It hosts nearly a thousand people directly and another ten thousand indirectly. Tourists come to Galle to witness its beauty and for relaxation. Charging a fee would hinder this. Preservation is possible only with public support.

They blocked the Kurunegala entrance of the Central Expressway, saying that their houses were on the verge of collapse due to the substandard construction of the road. They expressed dissatisfaction with the authorities’ lackadaisical attitude. In a collective effort, they drafted a petition with over 2,000 signatures, intending to present it to the United Nations. The letter highlighted the violation of their fundamental rights and the indifference shown by the Government. The petition was signed at the Royal Reception Hall in Theliyagonna where the protestors gathered and commenced the march.  They questioned the need for an expressway that jeopardises lives, harms the environment and traps people in debt. The protestors, forming a human blockade obstructed the highway entrance, chanting slogans such as “We gave our land, they stole our compensation” and “Does the President only see damage to Ministers houses?” Residents blocked the expressway causing a huge traffic block. Most vehicles were redirected causing frustration among those attempting to use the expressway. Officials who diverted the vehicles had to face the brunt of the anger. In response to the escalating situation, Kurunegala SP Priyantha Kasturiarachichi, IP (Acting) Pushpalal and Gattuwana IP Kelum Herath arrived on the scene to control the crowd. However, the protestors insisted they would not disperse until their grievances were addressed. Protestors demanded a written assurance from the Police that they would intervene and hold a discussion between protesters, the construction company and other relevant parties. The entrance was eventually reopened when Police issued a letter instructing the affected parties to negotiate with officials of the construction company in three days. BY Mithun Jayawardhana"

Once the Cabinet approves, we will invite them to sign the agreement,” Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told Reuters. Sri Lanka, trying to recover from its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years, is hungry for new investment and local fuel supplies. Sinopec’s investment of at least USD 4.5 billion “will go up in value as and when they do additions, but they must first come and sign the agreement for us to give any more details,” Wijesekera said. For Sinopec, the world’s top refinery by capacity and one of the largest petrochemical makers, the investment would mark a breakthrough in a long effort to expand beyond China’s borders. It owns refinery assets in Saudi Arabia and petrochemicals production in Russia. The Sri Lanka investment follows State-run China Merchant Port Holdings’ 99-year lease at Hambantota port and a USD 392 million deal to build a logistics and storage hub in Colombo port, Chinese State media reported in April. That fits into Beijing’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, billed as recreating the ancient Silk Road to boost global trade infrastructure, experts say. Sinopec will start basic engineering design, including finalising the size of the refinery and technical configuration, after getting official approval, a senior company official told Reuters this month. The investment will add to Sinopec’s recently started fuel retailing business, the third international company with a foothold in Sri Lanka, with a license to operates 150 petrol stations. In August Sinopec and commodities trader Vitol were shortlisted by the Sri Lankan Government to bid for the refinery. Vitol subsequently dropped out, the Sinopec official said. The refinery may target markets beyond Sri Lanka, where local fuel consumption is low, and use its partnership with China Merchants Port to expand bunker fuel supply at Hambantota, a deep-sea port near busy shipping lanes between Europe and Asia, analysts say. Sinopec’s fuel oil division, which runs the retail business there, began in 2019 supplying marine bunker fuel at Hambantota, another Sinopec official said. Sri Lanka’s refinery at Sapugaskanda, commissioned in 1969, can process 38,000 barrels of oil a day. (Reuters)"

They drew attention to the potential problems arising from the lack of focus on women’s welfare, with a detailed discussion on the challenges faced by school girls. In response, the COPF directed its attention to identifying the number of school girls in need of various facilities, including sanitary facilities, and proposed the establishment of a system to provide them with the necessary amenities. The committee also learned that civil society representatives expressed the urgent need to implement a systematic programme to provide sex education for children.

When asked if they were aware of the Government’s initiative to regulate behaviour on social media, one-third (34 per cent) of respondents answered in the affirmative.

The houses have structural issues such as cracked walls and roof slabs that leak during the rainy season as well.  Compounding the situation, four families are forced to share a single toilet, they alleged. Inadequate sanitation facilities often result in toilet pits overflowing, causing inconvenience to residents. As a result, school-going children frequently find it difficult to attend school due to these issues. Despite these concerns being brought to the notice of the authorities, they claimed that their pleas have been turned on deaf ears. The neglect by the authorities has left them in untold misery especially considering their role in maintaining the city’s cleanliness, they said.  BY W.M. Wickramarathne – Kantale"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

After taking into consideration, the submissions produced on Friday, the Judge deemed that the petitioner had willfully abstained, from divulging certain details, in her complaint. He further added in his ruling, that both the Leader and the General Secretary of the SJB, have ceased to be members of the UNP, since 2021 and that they were currently holding posts within the SJB.    Accordingly, he declined to deliver an interim injunction, against the SJB Leader and his General Secretary, as sought by Gamage. In her petition, the State Minister, had sought an interim order, preventing Premadasa from functioning as the SJB’s Leader and Parliamentarian Maddumabandara as the party’s General Secretary, alleging that the duo, were unsuitable to hold their respective positions, in the main Opposition. The petitioner had pointed out that, pursuant to the SJB’s Constitution, a member of another political party (UNP) cannot hold membership in the SJB.  She said there are already separate pending Court cases, filed by the Opposition Leader and Maddumabandara, with regard to their membership in the United National Party (UNP). As such, Gamage prayed for an interim order ruling, that it is unlawful for the two lawmakers, to hold their respective positions in the SJB, as they are still members of the UNP.

The President made this declaration following a vigorous Parliamentary discussion addressing the prolonged approval process by the Constitutional Council for high-ranking positions in the country. He emphasised that these delays have led to the absence of crucial roles, such as Inspector General of Police (IGP) and judges, resulting in the compromised functioning of both the Police and Judiciary. Regarding the appointment of Court of Appeal President Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne to the Supreme Court, the President expressed unawareness of the reasons behind the delay. He clarified that the nomination was made by the Chief Justice and submitted to the Constitutional Council by him. He made these statements, while addressing the questions raised by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, MPs Harsha de Silva and Rauf Hakeem. It paved the way for a lengthy discussion between the Opposition MPs and the President. President Wickremesinghe alleged that certain members within the CC were actively working to obstruct its functioning. Consequently, the decision was made to form a Parliamentary Select Committee to deliberate on matters related to the CC. The President highlighted the current inability to make appointments in the Sri Lanka Police and the Judiciary. He revealed that a letter from the Speaker to the CC received a response stating their inability to take decisions. Additionally, he disclosed that one member is yet to be appointed to the Constitutional Council, causing a split among the six existing members and two members abstaining from voting, further delaying appointments. Concerns were raised by the Opposition on the delay in appointing Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP Dharmalingam Sithadthan as the last member of the Council, as proposed by the Opposition. Premadasa alleged that the Speaker had failed to appoint MP Sithadthan to the Constitutional Council, and the Opposition cannot be held accountable for the Speaker’s inaction. The President also pointed out the challenges in appointing an Anti-Corruption Commission despite the passing of relevant laws due to similar issues with the CC. He emphasised that, despite being considered a Parliamentary Committee, the Council falls under the Executive and is responsible for evaluating the eligibility of nominees for high-ranking positions.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/11/24/aragalaya-diverted-police-military-attention-away-from-drugs-underworld-minister-alles/,"‘Aragalaya’ diverted Police, military attention away from drugs, underworld – Minister Alles",Author not found,0,2023-11-23T20:34:00+00:00," Minister of Public Security, Tiran Alles, claimed in Parliament yesterday (23) that, in his view, deploying the Police and Military exclusively to address the Aragalaya and its associated incidents for about a year, resulted in diverting the attention of the law enforcement agencies away from underworld activities and drug-related issues in the country.  Speaking during the Committee Stage debate on Expenditure Heads on Defence and Public Security, the Minister explained that the Police had to divert their full attention to Aragalaya, thereby shifting their focus from other duties and responsibilities. Highlighting the challenges faced by the Police Department, the Minister mentioned that there are more than 20,000 vacancies within the department. He outlined steps being taken to gradually address this shortage, considering the ongoing economic crisis. “We have successfully recruited 2,000 Police personnel this year, and our plan is to recruit an additional 5,000 personnel in the coming year,” Minister Alles added. In response to a statement made by MP Dullas Alahapperuma, during the debate, claiming that at least 50 deaths occur monthly due to underworld-related activities, Minister Alles contested that figure, asserting it to be significantly overstated. “Over the past four months, we’ve recorded 28 murders, with 16 involving shootings. Of these incidents, eight involved shooters, resulting in three deaths. Additionally, we made arrests in nine cases involving motorcycles, one of which resulted in a fatality. Furthermore, 67 individuals have been arrested for aiding and abetting these activities. Many of the key perpetrators have either been apprehended or neutralised during Police encounters. We have implemented a comprehensive programme, particularly in the Southern Province, although we cannot disclose all the details here. Rest assured, we are systematically working to suppress the activities of the underworld. We’ve extradited certain underworld figures from abroad and there are plans to bring in more in the future.” MP Thalatha Atukorale’s suggested to track the phone records of underworld figures like Harak Kata.  We are actively undertaking that task and taking measures to trace their assets as well, he added. “MP Rauff Hakeem expressed concern that Police Officers involved in the Easter Sunday attacks are facing retaliation, citing as an example the remanding of former DIG Ravi Seneviratne after his arrest for drunk driving. I personally know DIG Seneviratne and he was involved in a drunk driving incident where he damaged three vehicles. The arrest drew significant media attention and granting Police bail could have led to accusations of Police favouritism,” Minister Alles clarified. He said, Seneviratne was produced in the Court on the following day and remanded. Hakeem emphasised that this decision was made not by the Police, but, by the judiciary. Speaking further, Minister Alles responded to the allegations made by Colombo Archbishop His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith and the Catholic Church about the investigations into the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks. “There are 42 cases filed in the High Court. There are 80 respondents, with 23 individuals in remand at the moment. The investigations are 90% complete. Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith and the Catholic Church expressed a desire for the full Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report into the terror attacks. Upon discussing this matter with the President and I provided the full report to them and requested time for a presentation on the progress of the investigations.” However, there has been a delay in receiving the requested time, with them citing the extensive nature of the report as the reason for the delay. Despite this, periodic letters have been sent making allegations against several individuals. The President has also faced criticism during interviews conducted by the authorities, he stressed. Expressing his concerns, the minister alleged that there is a perceived lack of genuine interest from the Catholic Church’s in resolving the case. “There is another important thing. I have to request Cardinal Ranjith not to provoke racism in the country. It seems consistently attempt to interfere with government affairs using this issue. I have to reveal that the Cardinal tried to force the former President not to appoint then Justice Minister Ali Sabry to the post in 2020, just because he is a Muslim. These things should not happen. I request everyone not to work aiming at gaining votes,” he stressed.  BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

In an exclusive interview with Firstpost, India Wickremesinghe said, “India worried about its own security. Sri Lanka won’t do anything to hurt its security.” When asked about his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year, Wickremesinghe said, “I have known Narendra Modi since he was a Chief Minister. Our vision was a step forward. We talked about trade and investment.” He also highlighted India’s help when the country underwent an economic crisis last year. In May, India extended a one billion USD credit line for Sri Lanka by a year. The credit line is part of the four billion USD in emergency assistance extended by India. Commenting on the current economy in Sri Lanka, Wickremesinghe said, “We are not out of the woods yet, but will come out. We still have to balance the budget and trade and increase our revenues. I hope things will get better in 2024-2025. We can’t go on in transitional mode and need a new economy.” He also said there was no evidence to suggest that the Chinese research vessels that had recently docked in Sri Lanka were espionage vessels, emphasising that the nation requested evidence but none was provided, clarifying that these vessels were civilian in nature. Addressing concerns raised by India and the United States, regarding the arrival of the Chinese research vessels, Wickremesinghe assured that Sri Lanka welcomes both research and military vessels, not only from China but also from other countries. He pointed out the disparity in media coverage, noting that only the arrivals of Chinese vessels tend to make headlines, despite Sri Lanka routinely allowing vessels from various nations. When questioned about Sri Lanka’s position in the perceived ‘great power battle’ between China and India, Wickremesinghe asserted that the country would not take actions jeopardising the national security of its neighbour. Regarding the debt restructuring process, the President highlighted that China, as the largest bilateral creditor, chose to negotiate separately with Sri Lanka due to dissatisfaction with the terms offered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. He explained that China believes it should play a more significant role in the IMF, leading them to opt out of the negotiation process and complicating matters for indebted nations. Wickremesinghe acknowledged the challenges in negotiating Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring within the context of international geopolitics. He mentioned that the terms of the debt deal with China have been shared with other creditors. Discussing the country’s economic recovery, the President acknowledged the challenges faced in the past year but expressed optimism. He emphasised the need for Sri Lanka to balance its budget, trade, and increase revenues. He hoped for improvement by 2024-2025. Regarding the upcoming presidential election in 2024, Wickremesinghe stated that his current priority is to stabilise the economy. Once this goal is achieved, he will decide on his future course of action. He expressed confidence in unlocking the remainder of the IMF’s bailout package, indicating that Sri Lanka has met the global lender’s benchmarks."

He acknowledged that such occurrences should not happen within the parliamentary settings. Furthermore, Nishantha detailed the reasons behind his actions and highlighted alleged transgressions by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara during the same time.  Arguing that singling him out for disciplinary action amounted to a breach of his Parliamentary privileges, MP Sanath Nishantha urged the Speaker to conduct an investigation and take appropriate measures against Sajith Premadasa and Nalin Bandara in connection with the incident as well.  “I was put in that situation (brawl) due to several reasons. The Opposition Leader was violating his privileges with regard to making statements under the Standing Orders 27/2. Also, he was continuously insulting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is also an MP, violating the Standing Orders 91(h) and 92 (g). Also, Nalin Bandara was recording the incident without obtaining our constant. You (the Speaker) also warned him not to do that, but he disobeyed. That unfortunate incident happened due to these reasons,” he claimed.   On Wednesday (22) Speaker Abeywardena announced Nishantha’s suspension from parliamentary activities for a two-week period, following the unruly incident that took place on the previous day (21). The Speaker, invoking Standing Order 146 of the Parliament, expressed his strong disapproval of the brawl that unfolded during the sittings.  A pandemonium enraged when Premadasa raised questions about individuals, including the Rajapaksa brothers, held responsible by the Supreme Court for the economic crisis. SLPP MPs, including State Minister Sanath Nishantha, reportedly disrupted the speech and surrounded Premadasa’s seat, prompting a suspension of the session. Accusations were also levelled against State Minister Nishantha for allegedly snatching the Opposition Leader’s binder, containing official documents, during the brawl.  BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

R2L asserted that Alex Nagarasa’s death, allegedly caused by torture during his time in the custody of the Vaddukoddai Police, raises serious concerns. The organisation emphasised the urgency of amending the Criminal Procedure Code and granting Magistrates the authority to visit law enforcement facilities. The statement highlighted the need for an impartial and thorough investigation into the incident, underlining that torture and ill-treatment by Police Officers violate international human rights law, fundamental rights, and principles of justice guaranteed by the Constitution.

China has been experiencing an increase in cases of influenza-like illnesses compared with the same period in the previous three years when strict measures were in force as part of its zero-Covid strategy. That policy was abruptly abandoned in December 2022. The WHO noted that China’s National Health Commission told a press conference, earlier this month, that there had been an increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases, attributing them to the lifting of Covid-19, measures and the spread not only of Covid-19 but pathogens such as influenza, mycoplasma pneumoniae (a common bacterial infection which typically affects younger children), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Earlier this week, ProMED, an online medical community, that raised questions in late 2019, about an unknown illness circulating in Wuhan, that later became Covid-19, noted a growing number of media reports of clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia among children in northern China.  (Al Jazeera)"

Speaking at a media briefing, held at the Ministry, Dr. Gunawardena refrained from providing further details from the report due to the ongoing Court case related to the matter.  Responding to queries from the media about former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella’s statement suggesting the presence of saline in the contentious medicinal drug, the DGHS emphasised his inability to elaborate, citing the ongoing Court proceedings. Regarding concerns about a potential conflict of interest, given the reappointment of former National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) CEO Dr. Vijith Gunasekara as the MRI Chief, Dr. Gunawardena clarified that the report had been submitted to the Ministry before Dr. Gunasekara’s reappointment. He assured that Dr. Gunasekara’s involvement would not affect the findings, as the testing had been conducted independently in the Immunology Department of the MRI. Dr. Gunawardena highlighted that three separate investigations into the immunoglobulin IV matter were underway and being conducted by the CID, the Auditor General’s Department and the Health Ministry.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

During a media briefing at the President’s Media Centre (PMC) on Wednesday (22), Minister Sabry emphasised the complexity of the economic challenges and asserted that short-term solutions would not be sufficient. He underscored the importance of strategic planning and continuous efforts to achieve economic stability. Addressing the issue of tax evasion, Sabry stressed the necessity of bringing tax evaders into the tax net to uphold the country’s status as a welfare State. A programme slated for implementation this year aims to enhance tax compliance. The Minister provided an overview of positive economic progress, citing significant achievements such as a substantial reduction in inflation from 70% to 2.5% and a 100% increase in tourist arrivals. He stated that these indicators signify the country’s movement in the right direction economically. Acknowledging the authority of politicians to make diverse decisions, Sabry emphasised that citizens bear the resulting burdens. To overcome present challenges and attract new investments, the nation must focus on job creation, particularly by integrating the creative youth community into the job market. The 2024 Budget is designed with these goals in mind, setting the country on a path toward a new economic paradigm. The Minister highlighted substantial allocations for digitisation, modernisation of agriculture, and education in this year’s budget. He emphasised the need to avoid bureaucratic obstacles and promote collaborative efforts in executing these initiatives. Key decisions include granting rights to individuals in flats and rented houses, as well as providing land rights to farmers. Minister Sabry emphasised fiscal responsibility, noting that 70 per cent of this year’s Budget has been allocated for loan instalments and interest payments. He drew attention to Sri Lanka’s position as the 8th country with the lowest taxes globally, emphasising the importance of bringing tax evaders into the system. A dedicated programme for this purpose is set to commence this year to restore transparency. He stressed that there are no quick fixes for the economic crisis. Instead, a viable way forward involves the implementation of a comprehensive, long-term targeted programme."

Police charged at away fans following scuffles before kick-off in a section of the Maracana Stadium that Messi says contained players’ friends and family. Argentina captain Messi and his players went over to try and calm the situation before returning to the dressing room. “It was bad because we saw how they were beating people,” said Messi, 36. “The Police, as happened in the Libertadores final, were once again repressing the people with night sticks. “We went to the locker room because it was the best way to calm everything down, it could have ended in tragedy. “You think about the families, the people who are there, who don’t know what’s going on and we were more concerned about that than playing a match that, at that point, was of secondary importance.” The trouble began when rival fans clashed in a stand behind one of the goals at the stadium in Rio de Janeiro during the national anthems, prompting Police to charge at Argentina’s supporters, some using batons. Some supporters ripped out seats and threw them at Police in response, while others spilled out onto the pitch to escape the trouble. The Argentina players and some members of the Brazil team walked over to try to calm the situation, with Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez trying to grab a baton out of a Police officer’s hand. The players eventually left the field before returning after Police had gathered the Argentina fans into a separate section of the stand and the game was able to begin after 30-minute delay. The trouble unfolded a fortnight after scuffles between fans of Brazilian side Fluminense and Argentine club Boca Juniors before the Copa Libertadores final – the South American equivalent of the Champions League final – which was also staged at the Maracana. Brazil captain Marquinhos, who joined the Argentina players on the pitch calling for calm in the stands, added: “We were worried about the families, women and children that we were seeing in panic up there in the stands. “Down on the pitch it was hard for us to understand what was going on, it was a very scary situation.” World champions Argentina won 1-0 thanks to a goal from former Manchester City defender Nicolas Otamendi. Newcastle United midfielder Joelinton was sent off for Brazil, who lost a home World Cup qualifier for the first time. The five-time World Cup winners have now lost three successive qualifiers to sit sixth in the South American qualifying table, eight points behind leaders Argentina and in the last spot that guarantees a place at the 2026 finals."

Director of the NSTD/AIDSCP, Dr. Janaki Vidanapathirana said they were hopeful that the Ministry of Justice would take measures to amend Sections 365 and 365A of the Penal Code as the Supreme Court has already determined that repealing them doesn’t violate the Constitution.  Fielding questions, she said yesterday (22) that it would largely help the programme to achieve further success should the stigma and discrimination be removed even if it was from the Constitution to help vulnerable groups.  She noted that the Supreme Court had determined the constitutionality of a Private Member’s Bill titled, ‘Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2023,’ whose stated objective had been to repeal “provisions that made sexual orientation a punishable offence.” It would be a considerable leap should the Minister of Justice move to amend or repeal these two sections, namely Sections 365 and 365A which criminalise same-sex relations at least after the Budget was passed in Parliament.  She lamented that Sri Lanka’s NSTD/AIDSCP was somewhat lagging behind targets set by UNAIDS and Global Development Goals as possible vulnerable groups of persons were reluctant to obtain their services owing to fear of discrimination and stigma. “HIV testing is the first key to achieve the colossal goal of ending AIDS by 2030 and UNAIDS recommended 95-95-95 targets by 2025 for any country that commits to this goal,” Dr. Vidanapathirana said.  Accordingly, 95 per cent of people living with HIV should know their HIV status. But to achieve that the way should be open for people to test themselves without fearing that they were being looked down on, she pointed out.  Meanwhile, the lack of Age-Appropriate Sexuality Education was highly important in preventing the increasing number of teenage and youth infections of HIV. Dr. Vidanapathirana said since 2018 there has been a gradual increase in the number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among young people between the ages of 15 to 24. Of the 607 new cases diagnosed with the HIV infection 73 (12 per cent) were aged 15 to 24. She lamented that 66 of them had been males. While some teachers were known to provide this knowledge and create satisfactory awareness amongst their students, others merely brushed through the lessons on sex education. “What we presently do is try to get hold of a few adults and attempt to bridge this gap in their knowledge about sex education,” she lamented. She pointed out that HIV testing was the first key to achieving an end to AIDS by 2030. And UNAIDS had recommended achieving the 95-95-95 targets by 2025 for any country committed to the goal. Accordingly, she noted that this meant that 95 per cent of people living with HIV should know their HIV status and 95 per cent of the people who know they are HIV positive should be on life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 95 per cent of people on ART should be virally supported. President, Sri Lanka College of Sexual Health, Dr. Thilani Ratnayake noted that the National Programme had taken precautions to make HIV tests available to a wider population using many different innovative and user-friendly methods such as the self-testing kit.

Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

However, they argued that various challenges, including last year’s electricity crisis and frequent power cuts, limited their effective study period to only 300 days. They also asserted that this shortfall in study time has hindered their ability to cover the syllabi comprehensively for all subjects.   By Methmalie Dissanayake"

Issuing tickets at toll booths on Expressways islandwide was managed by the tri-forces yesterday (22) as all ranks of employees from the Road Development Authority (RDA) including expressway employees reported sick.  Director General of the Road Development Authority, L.V.S. Weerakoon, speaking to Ceylon Today, explained that the tri-forces were called in to ensure the safety of the expressway and other roads, as well as to minimise loss incurred by operating vehicles without collecting fees.  Weerakoon said employees working on the expressways had planned to leave their posts while keeping the toll gates open. If such a situation had taken place , it could have led to a significant number of accidents on expressways, he said.  As a result, he stated that the Government sought the support of the tri-forces to manage the security of expressways, in the hope that the employees would return to work by today (23).  He also said that on Tuesday (21), the Army was given an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the management activities of the expressway network due to the sudden strike of employees.  Weerakoon said that manual ticket issuance will be implemented, and after the return of thos working in the highway network, the military will hand over duties and the money to the RDA.  Brigadier Ravi Herath, Army spokesman said military officials who were deployed on expressways provided support for the administrative work on the request to carry out  duties on the highway.  He said administrative work of the Southern Expressway is handled by the Army, the administrative work of the Central Expressway is managed by the Navy, and the administrative work of the Katunayake Expressway is overseen by the Air Force.  Brigadier Herath added that 30 officers and 250 other ranks have been assigned for duties on the Southern Expressway.  He said that when the tri-forces took over yesterday, the ticket machines were disabled on the Expressways, allowing people to travel without charge for the first two hours.  Meanwhile, Yohan Gunasinghe, President of the All-Ceylon Expressway Employees’ Union, explained that due to several issues, including plans to privatise the expressway network, employees from all ranks of the RDA reported sick.  He said employees have withdrawn from duties at toll booths on all expressways and maintenance on Expressways.  Gunasinghe said the strike is based on three key issues which are attempts by the Finance Ministry and RDA to privatise the Expressway network, delayed payments for unused sick leave for 2022 and delayed approval for the System for Optimised Recruitment (SOR) which deferred the grade-to-grade promotions of all employees.  He added that a letter detailing these issues, with the signatures of representatives from 26 trade unions of all grades was sent to the RDA Director General.  A discussion was also held at the Ministry of Transport Highways on Tuesday (21) regarding these matters but was unsuccessful.  BY Mithun Jayawardhana"

In a special statement delivered in Parliament yesterday (21) morning, the President addressed allegations of ‘protecting’ Shammi Silva, the President of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), and other higher-ups in the cricket governing body. Wickremesinghe dismissed these claims and described the cricket turmoil in the country as a long-standing issue, attributing the decline of the sport to a power struggle between two groups. Acknowledging the need for a legal solution to the cricket administration issue, President Wickremesinghe revealed that he advised the Sports Minister against engaging in a legal battle, as it could result in a ban from the International Cricket Council (ICC) and negatively impact the country’s tourism sector. Expressing concern over certain individuals criticising Court judgments related to the cricket matter, the President denounced MPs for targeting judges within the parliamentary setting, emphasising the importance of letting the judiciary perform its duties independently. President Wickremesinghe also highlighted the necessity for MPs to adhere to the Standing Orders of Parliament. In response to the ICC’s concerns about government involvement in Sri Lankan cricket, the President acknowledged that accusations of political interference cannot be dismissed, particularly after MPs collectively presented a resolution against the SLC.

A brawl erupted between the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MPs and ruling party MPs, while Premadasa was raising a series of questions, under the Standing Order 27/2, regarding the recent Supreme Court verdict on the economic crisis. This forced Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to suspend the sittings for five minutes. The chaos went deeper, when the Opposition Leader as well as Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella alleged that State Minister Sanath Nishantha ran away after forcibly grabbing a file from the Opposition Leader’s desk, which contained several important documents.  During his speech, Premadasa highlighted that individuals such as former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, former Central Bank Governors Ajith Nivard Cabraal and Prof. W.D. Lakshman, former Finance Secretary S.R. Attygalle, former Presidential Secretary P.B. Jayasundera and members of the Central Bank’s Monetary Board continued to enjoy their privileges despite the Supreme Court’s judgment of 14 November holding them accountable for the economic crisis. Premadasa emphasised that these individuals showed no respect for the Supreme Court judgment, and ordinary citizens are still bearing the consequences of their incorrect decisions. The Opposition Leader asserted that leniency cannot be extended to these individuals, considering the heightened public anticipation for decisive action against them. As Premadasa posed questions about the Government’s stance, the legal measures it intends to implement and whether it will recover the State’s losses due to those implicated, a group of infuriated ruling party MPs interrupted the address and later approached the Opposition Leader’s seat. When the ruling party MPs, including Sanath Nishantha, Prasanna Ranaweera, Mahindananda Aluthgamage and Janaka Thissakuttiarachchi approached the Opposition Leader, Sergeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando and several Parliament staff members hurried into the scene and tried to defuse the situation. SJB MP Nalin Bandara started to go on Facebook live at this juncture and the Speaker repeatedly warned him to stop the recording. Sanath Nishantha who grabbed the Opposition Leader’s microphone shouted, “You have to reveal the thefts conducted by your sister too” (Nangige horakamuth kiyanna). Thissakuttiarachchi shouted, “Why are you doing this to our Mahinda Rajapaksa?” After a few minutes, the Speaker suspended the sittings for five minutes. After the sittings resumed, Premadasa finished reading the statement. The Opposition then alleged that Sanath Nishantha stole a set of files belonging to the Opposition leader during the brawl. They alleged that Sanath Nishantha took the Opposition Leader’s microphone and seized the file from which Premadasa was reading his questions. The Opposition Leader brought attention to this incident, in the presence of the Speaker, asking what action and steps would be taken against MP Sanath Nishantha over his behaviour.  The Opposition Leader argued that this incident infringed upon the rights and privileges granted to him. He urged the Speaker to treat all MPs equally, emphasising that in the past, the Speaker has taken disciplinary actions against such behaviour. Furthermore, Premadasa criticised the Speaker for not taking the incident more seriously. He emphasised his commitment to hold those responsible for the country’s economic downturn accountable, unlike others who celebrated the birthdays of those allegedly involved. In response to the Speaker’s announcement of an investigation into the incident, Premadasa asserted that a mere investigation is insufficient. He demanded the immediate return of the files, along with all the documents he alleges were stolen by MP Sanath Nishantha. Lakshman Kiriella also demanded disciplinary action against ruling party MPs who disturbed Premadasa’s statement. Meanwhile, the Speaker announced that video recording of sessions and going live on social media will be prohibited. “MPs who video record sessions and go live on social media will be severely dealt with,” he said. Furthermore, the Speaker said he received Premadasa’s missing file and the latter can take it. However, Premadasa alleged that several important documents had gone missing from the file. “Sergeant-at-Arms gave that file to me. But when I checked I found several important documents have gone missing. I refused to take the file after that and I won’t take it without those documents,” he stressed.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

It is estimated that about 12,000 people die due to accidents in this country every year. That is about 35 people per day. Accordingly, every three hours, four people die due to accidents. Furthermore, accidents are the main health problem in the economically productive age group of 15-44 years and the leading cause of death in that age group. Every year over a million victims are treated as in-ward patients in public hospitals. Millions more are treated in the out- patient department (OPD) of State hospitals.  While another sizable number go to the private sector to receive treatment from non-western medical professionals. There is a section that resigns itself to self-medicate at home. The Unit said that 25% 30% (250,000, 300,000) of those who are hospitalised due to accidents are those who have fallen due to various reasons and 17% to 18% (200, 000) would be hospitalised due to road accidents. In addition to this, cuts due to various reasons, various objects falling on the body, conscious or unconscious assaults, animal bites (about 250,000 to 300,000 animal bites are treated in government hospitals annually), stings, various poisonings, burns, etc. According to current information, more than 50% of all accidents occur in the home and its surrounding environment. About 25% are road-related, while the majority of the rest of the incidents occur in workplaces, schools, shelters and recreational areas, the Unit explained.  Meanwhile, Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana noted that these statistics were very significantly dangerous and disturbing.  Addressing the International Conference Dr. Pathirana said, the Ministry of Health, was fully committed to ensuring that best was provided in implementation of the policy action that was decided.  “In fact, this is the fourth week that I am in this position as the Minister of Health and I was very moved by the fact that a sheer number has been affected by the injuries. I am very convinced that we should take more strong action, in relation to prevention of injuries and also to support other sectors which have multi-faceted and multi sectoral approach to ensure that Sri Lankan people lead a better life in relation to injury prevention,” he said noting that other ministries, including the Transport Ministry, Ministry of Education should increase awareness amongst the Sri Lankan students and the Ministry of Justice should enact necessary laws to take necessary legal action.

This programme is by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) together with the Department of Agriculture and the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka with funding from the European Union (EU).  They recently launched a Farmer Field Schools Programme to train 6,000 smallholder paddy farmers, across four key rice-growing districts, on sustainable approaches to paddy cultivation. By adopting IPNM and more efficient use of chemical fertilisers, smallholder paddy farmers can reduce costs and improve productivity, leading to better profitability and resilience to future shocks. Many paddy farmers in Sri Lanka rely on traditional cultivation methods, often exceeding the recommended amounts of fertilisers provided by the Department of Agriculture without a full understanding of the respective soil nutrient requirements of their fields. To address these challenges, the Farmer Field School Programme will facilitate soil testing and efficient fertiliser use through IPNM practices, emphasising soil management, compost, and biochar production. The programme will also focus on implementing good agronomic practices, including using high-quality seeds, proper land preparation, the parachute method for seed broadcasting, efficient water management and effective weed, pest, and disease management, all integral components of IPNM practices. All  activities are being implemented through the project titled ‘RiceUP’, an innovative project launched by FAO, together with the government of Sri Lanka with Euro 4 million in funding from the EU to tackle the vulnerability of the food security system in Sri Lanka. The project aims to respond to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka by protecting smallholder farmer livelihoods through the safe and efficient use of fertiliser along with boosting the production of quality seed paddy for better productivity in paddy farming. The launch of the Farmer Field Schools comes after 289 Agriculture Extension Officers were trained with the necessary skills and knowledge to guide 6,000 paddy farmers on IPNM practices to enhance yields while reducing dependency on chemical fertilisers. The Agriculture Extension Officers will act as facilitators and work with the selected farmers to adapt appropriate exercises relevant to their local conditions. Through the implementation of sustainable farming practices, including the safe and efficient use of fertiliser and quality seeds, RiceUP aims to enhance productivity, food security, and livelihoods in Sri Lanka’s paddy farming sector. Together with its partners, FAO remains dedicated to ensuring the long-term sustainability and resilience of Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Marasinghe attributed the government’s ability to generate Rs 2,400 billion by October, with a target of Rs 600 billion more by year-end, to President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s unparalleled economic skills.  Expressing confidence in achieving revenue targets, Marasinghe mentioned key entities, including the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs, and 39 other income-generating entities under government purview.  The estimated State expenditure for 2023, initially at Rs 5,800 billion, was effectively managed by President Wickremesinghe, reducing it to Rs 3,068 billion, with measures in place to keep expenses below revenue levels, stated Prof. Marasinghe.  He noted the current GDP of 10.3%, was just below the targeted 12% and expressed confidence in achieving the nominal percentage by year-end.

A senior official from the department told Ceylon Today that while the Government is in discussions about utilising the RAMIS computer system to enhance the existing tax network in the country, his department lacks the human resources required to properly maintain the computer system. Despite multiple notifications to the concerned parties, no action has been taken to address this issue, he added. The official disclosed that the National Audit Office has reported a loss of over Rs 904 billion in total arrears of taxes, fines, and interest by the IRD attributable to the RAMIS and Legacy computer systems as of 31 December 2022. Of this amount, Rs 163 billion is identified as chargeable income, while Rs 740 billion is suspended due to specific reasons. Despite these challenges, and with the Government’s new tax policy aiming to strengthen the tax network, the official expressed concern that necessary action is not being taken. He highlighted that these concerns have been raised at the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) on multiple occasions, and the IRD presented a clarification on this matter on 15 November.  During the COPA sitting, it was revealed that six institutions are connected to the RAMIS computer system and there is a delay of the Company Registrar’s Department in connecting to the system due to technical reasons. The Committee recommended that the Company Registrar’s Department promptly update its system and connect with the RAMIS system, instructing them to provide a progress report by 1 January 2024. Meanwhile, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe emphasised the use of a comprehensive digital system to network information about groups not paying taxes accurately. He mentioned the improvement of the RAMIS system, effective from 1 January, to strengthen the existing tax network by integrating new digital systems. Under four main categories—properties, vehicles, income licences, and current accounts—tax registration numbers will be made mandatory to streamline the tax network, aiming for a 15 per cent increase in government income. Despite economic challenges, he expressed optimism that as the country’s contraction eases, the new tax policy will contribute to economic stability without returning to a crisis.

With the special commodity tax on imported sugar increasing from 25 cents to Rs 50 per kg, many traders raised sugar prices, prompting the government to enforce a MRT to regulate it. Accordingly, a maximum retail price of Rs 275 per kg for white sugar and Rs 330 per kg for brown sugar has been fixed. Consumers have noted that there is not only a scarcity of sugar, but also a shortage of Samba and Keeri Samba rice in the market. The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has declared its commitment to conducting raids to identify sellers offering sugar and rice above the prescribed control prices. Siyambalapitiya instructed the CAA to identify and take action against those selling sugar above the MRT. He emphasised that it is not only the government’s responsibility but also the responsibility of the public to purchase sugar at the correct price and prevent unnecessary shortages.

During the COPA sitting, concerns were raised about whether the government is effectively receiving the Value Added Tax (VAT), paid by the public for various goods. Currently, there are around 13,000 organisations registered for VAT and IRD officials mentioned that they are actively monitoring tax payments. The committee emphasised the need for institutions collecting VAT from the public to establish systems ensuring accurate remittance of taxes to the government. The COPA chairman instructed the IRD to provide a comprehensive report on taxes levied through various classifications and a detailed report on the outstanding arrears amounting to Rs 943 billion. These discussions took place during the COPA Committee’s review of the Auditor General’s reports for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, as well as an assessment of the current performance of the IRD.  BY Mithun Jayawardhana"

The Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board allocated Rs 389 million from its funds for the initial phase until government financial allocations are received.  During the ceremony, Minister Amaraweera distributed compensation to 375 farmers in the Hambantota District for crop damage, including paddy, chillies, potato, maize, soybeans, and big onions, considering losses caused by drought, heavy rains and wild elephants. Surveys indicate that 65,000 acres were damaged due to drought and 11,000 acres due to rain. Compensation is provided up to a maximum of Rs 100,000 per hectare. The awarded compensation totalled Rs 360 million for 13,451 acres in the Hambantota Mahaweli area and Rs 2,498,400 for 89 acres in Chandrikaweva, Kolonna, Panamure and Thibolketiya agrarian service areas.

He said even though the Government had not yet received the necessary financial allocations, he advised the Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board to begin payments using available funds. Recognising that the provided Rs 100,000 per hectare may not fully cover the losses, Minister Amaraweera said the substantial compensation being distributed is possibly the highest in history for crop damage. He stressed the difficult situation faced by affected farmers, expressing hope that swift compensation would offer relief. Additionally, he announced the distribution of 40 litres of fuel free of charge to all farmers affected by crop damage. This decision was made using the remaining two million litres of the 6.9 million litres of fuel provided by the Chinese Government. Chairman of the Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board M.M.B.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Last Friday (17), the minister engaged in an observation tour of the Welipanna, Peragaswatta high-density tea plantation. Under the guidance and funding of the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority, this seven-and-a-half-acre plantation, cultivated using the high-density cultivation method and Drip Irrigation technology, has yielded a highly successful harvest. While the normal tea cultivation method involves planting 6,500 tea plants per acre, the high-density cultivation method allows for the planting of 13,000 tea plants per acre. Additionally, under the traditional method, only 300 kg of tea leaves can be harvested from one acre, but with the high-density method, a high yield of 1,500 kg of tea leaves can be obtained. Moreover, the use of new technical equipment to pick tea leaves eliminates the need for manual labour, enabling farmers to increase their income fivefold. Notably, this intensive tea cultivation can be achieved with a minimal amount of water and fertiliser. The Tea Small Holdings Development Authority and the Tea Board have successfully implemented 52 such model tea cultivation projects. Further, financial assistance of Rs 1 million per acre has been provided to growers without recovery. This approach allows for maximum yield from a minimum amount of land and ensures a high-quality tea yield. Consequently, the minister urged the chairpersons to encourage the adoption of this high-density tea cultivation system among other growers and to take steps to expand these activities in 2024. Aligning with the vision outlined by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in the Budget document, the minister emphasised his goal to integrate new technology into the agriculture and plantation sector in 2024. He urged all officials to be dedicated to achieving the maximum yield from cultivated land."

He asserted that if the country faced economic challenges due to tax concessions, these two parties also contributed to this situation. Rajapaksa stressed that the responsibility for the economic crisis should be borne by the present leaders of the SJB who were members of the Good Governance Government, as well as the JVP members who supported that Government. During the Presidential Election defeat of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015, the country’s economic growth stood at 7 per cent, but on returning to power in 2020, the economic growth dropped to 2 per cent, according to Namal Rajapaksa. He highlighted that the Government led by Gotabaya Rajapaksa had pledged to reduce taxes in its election manifesto. Rajapaksa questioned how the reduction of taxes, in accordance with the given mandate, could be deemed a mistake. Rajapaksa noted the irony that academics who went to Court against the tax reduction, including VAT took to the streets when the present government increased taxes based on IMF recommendations. He acknowledged that while some individuals may be offended by criticism of the Budget, if there are mistakes in any government, he will not hesitate to point them out for the sake of the people. Rajapaksa further explained that the present crisis has arisen because Gotabaya Rajapaksa remained silent on incorrect decisions, such as the use of organic fertiliser during his regime. He underscored the importance of learning from mistakes and stated that he would not hesitate to criticise and point out errors not only in the Budget but also in any decision taken by the Government."

His profound knowledge in education and administration became evident as we engaged with him not only in the classroom, but also in various extracurricular activities of the school, he said.  “My close association with him, especially during his tenure overseeing the cadets, provided us with invaluable discipline and training, lessons that have continued to fortify us in life. He consistently underscored the importance of respecting the teaching profession,” the PM said.  Minister Premajayantha said, under the visionary leadership of R.I.T Alles, D.S. Senanayake College accommodates approximately 6,000 students across 157 classrooms, ranging from Grades 1 to 13. All classrooms have undergone transformation into friendly learning spaces, funded by the Government. The entire school is equipped with Wi-Fi, demonstrating a commitment to incorporating technology into education. “In response to the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic and the five-year scholarship exam, there is a specific focus on addressing the crisis in primary education. The goal is to streamline the educational process, ensuring that our children’s education aligns with the technological advancements shaping the world.    Efforts have been implemented to minimise delays in education. Textbooks for the year 2024 have been printed, and the first batch of uniforms is scheduled to be received by the end of next month. Plans are also in progress to provide lunch to every student. In collaboration with UNESCO, coupons are being distributed for the production of school shoes for 800,000 children.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Premadasa pressed for an immediate response, insisting on clarification about the circumstances surrounding Kanishka Bandara’s presence at the COPE meeting. “I am the Opposition Leader of this country. But, I was barred from attending the COPE meetings earlier. In such a backdrop, how come Bandara’s son was allowed to be at the COPE meeting? Who allowed him to do that?” Premadasa queried.  Premadasa called for temporary suspension of Bandara as COPE Chairman during the ongoing meetings with SLC, citing a potential conflict of interest.  Meanwhile, Premadasa presented documentation in Parliament indicating that Bandara serves as a consultant for SLC on the Kandy Cricket Campus Project. Additionally, another consultancy firm owned by Bandara provides services to SLC. Premadasa questioned whether Prof. Bandara should continue as the COPE Chairman, emphasising the lack of disclosure regarding his connection to SLC and the potential conflict of interest.

Sri Lanka too is reeling from multiple crises and with climate change impacts already being experienced, recovery comes at a high cost. Sri Lanka annually spends LKR 50 billion on climate-induced post-disaster contingent liabilities that arise through floods, droughts, landslides, and storms including relief assistance for damages incurred to housing, infrastructure, agricultural crops, and businesses. The Paris Agreement lays out a collective framework for all countries to address climate change. But, reports come in that there is still limited progress in reducing the emissions gap by 2030, and there is a global call to scale up climate action to keep the 1.5°C objective within reach.  Responding to this call, led by the Ministry of Environment and supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)’s Climate Promise Phase II Project, Sri Lanka has ramped up their commitment to achieving the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and has outlined targets in an Implementation Plan till 2030, focusing on an integrated, holistic approach to enable transformative impact across sectors.  To launch Sri Lanka’s NDC Implementation Plan, a briefing was held this afternoon in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment. Speaking at this high-level forum, Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Secretary, Ministry of Environment said, “Sri Lanka accelerated its climate action through the launch of the Climate Prosperity Plan at COP27. The revised National Policy on Climate Change (2023) and 2050 Carbon Net Zero Road Map and Strategy are expected to be launched at COP28 this year. The NDCs act as the base for these strategic interventions and implementing the NDCs will lead to increasing Sri Lanka’s share of renewable energy, adopting adaptation interventions, and increasing our coping capacity and resilience to climate disasters”. Sharing progress on Sri Lanka’s NDCs, Dr. R.D.S. Jayathunga, Additional Secretary (Environment Development), Ministry of Environment highlighted, “The NDCs are a nexus and linking point through which we can reinforce our national sustainable development targets including the targets laid out in our National Environment Action Plan and National Adaptation Plan”. Operationalising the NDC Implementation Plan, especially the unconditional targets will require mobilising significant financial resources and exploring innovative financial instruments and different sources of finance including the private sector. Malin Herwig, Officer-in-Charge, UNDP said, “Smart investments in the NDC sectors and targets can stimulate economic recovery and set Sri Lanka on a trajectory to carbon neutral pathways and improve climate resilience over the longer term”. The NDC Implementation Plan sets out a blueprint for immediate climate action. With the first global stocktake of progress on the Paris Agreement scheduled for discussion at the 28th session of the Conference of Parties (COP28) in Dubai later this year, it is an opportunity for all countries to course correct and accelerate action to tackle the climate crisis."

Kariyawasam highlighted the numerous features of the 2024 budget proposal, emphasising its significant impact on improving the living standards of the average population. The allocation of Rs 183 billion for social security is three times higher than the Rs 60 billion set aside in previous budgets for the same purpose. Notably, 1.8 million people have been entitled to the ‘Aswesuma’ welfare programme through Budget 2024, surpassing the number of beneficiaries under the Samurdhi welfare program. Kariyawasam encouraged those eligible but not included to appeal to the relevant authorities in their respective areas. Speaking at the media briefing at UNP Headquarters, Sirikotha, Kariyawasam criticised the politically bankrupt Opposition and other factions for making misleading statements and comments against the budget, both inside and outside the parliament. He suggested that these factions are attempting to derive satisfaction from the situation for their political gain. Kariyawasam noted that Budget 2024 differs significantly from conventional budgets as the President had to balance meeting the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) while simultaneously providing relief and concessions to the people. He highlighted the announcement of a Rs 10,000 salary increase for government employees, benefiting a total of 1.3 million State sector employees. Another noteworthy aspect of Budget 2024 is the reintroduction of the Suraksha free insurance scheme for students, previously introduced during the Good Governance Government led by the United National Front (UNF). This scheme will benefit 4.5 million students in government and private schools. Kariyawasam also emphasised the importance of establishing more universities to save significant foreign reserves spent on foreign education annually. Redirecting these funds towards other development purposes would be advantageous, he added. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

Concerns were raised during a recent meeting at the Ministry of Plantation, where the association highlighted issues arising in the sector. Despite coconut exports occurring, they are not officially recognised as export-oriented. During the meeting, the association addressed coconut cultivation, export, and domestic consumption. The country’s daily coconut requirement is 4.8 million, while daily production stands at three million. Consequently, 75 per cent of the total harvest is consumed domestically, leaving only 25 per cent for export. Coconut exports generate an annual income of USD 850 million. To boost this figure to two billion USD, the association stressed the need to designate coconut as a plantation crop for export. The international demand for coconut is rising, and the high quality of locally produced coconuts maintains a strong market demand. The association also proposed discussions between the minister and coconut industrialists to revise coconut prices in collaboration with the Treasury. Over the past decade, coconut cultivation has seen a continuous increase in cultivated land, with 100,000 acres of new coconut plantations established. The association emphasised the potential advantages of naming coconut as a targeted export-oriented plantation crop due to the high demand for coconut-related products. The discussion, attended by Ministry Secretary Janaka Dharmakirthi and other officials, aimed to address and find solutions to the challenges faced by the coconut industry."

They’ve detailed targets in an Implementation Plan stretching until 2030, emphasising an integrated, holistic approach to drive transformative impact across various sectors. Sri Lanka annually spends Rs 50 billion on climate-induced post-disaster contingent liabilities that arise through floods, droughts, landslides, and storms including relief assistance for damage incurred to housing, infrastructure, agricultural crops, and businesses. From record-breaking temperatures to increasing extreme weather events, in 2022 alone Asia recorded 81 weather, climate and water-related disasters which directly affected more than 50 million people, costing USD 36 billion in economic damages according to the World Meteorological Organization’s State of the Climate in Asia report. The global landscape is changing dramatically with the climate crisis becoming the new normal. Sri Lanka too is reeling from multiple crises and with climate change impacts already being experienced, recovery comes at a high cost. The Paris Agreement lays out a collective framework for all countries to address climate change, however, reports come in that there is still limited progress in reducing the emissions gap by 2030, and there is a global call to scale up climate action to keep the 1.5°C objective within reach. To launch Sri Lanka’s NDC Implementation Plan, a briefing was held this afternoon in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment.  Speaking at this high-level forum, Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Secretary, Ministry of Environment said, “Sri Lanka accelerated its climate action through the launch of the Climate Prosperity Plan at COP27. The revised National Policy on Climate Change (2023) and 2050 Carbon Net Zero Road Map and Strategy are expected to be launched at COP28 this year. The NDCs act as the base for these strategic interventions and implementing the NDCs will lead to increasing Sri Lanka’s share of renewable energy, adopting adaptation interventions and increasing our coping capacity and resilience to climate disasters.” Sharing progress on Sri Lanka’s NDCs, Dr. R.D.S. Jayathunga, Additional Secretary (Environment Development), Ministry of Environment highlighted, “The NDCs are a nexus and linking point through which we can reinforce our national sustainable development targets including the targets laid out in our National Environment Action Plan and National Adaptation Plan.” Operationalising the NDC Implementation Plan, especially the unconditional targets will require mobilising significant financial resources and exploring innovative financial instruments and different sources of finance including the private sector. Malin Herwig, Officer-In-Charge, UNDP said, “Smart investments in the NDC sectors and targets can stimulate economic recovery and set Sri Lanka on a trajectory to carbon neutral pathways and improve climate resilience over the longer term.” The NDC Implementation Plan sets out a blueprint for immediate climate action. With the first global stocktake of progress on the Paris Agreement scheduled for discussion at the 28th session of the Conference of Parties (COP28) in Dubai later this year, it is an opportunity for all countries to course correct and accelerate action to tackle the climate crisis.

Speaking at the Presidential Film Awards 2023 held at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre on 14 November, he emphasised the need to eliminate the term ‘censorship’ from artistic creation. The President addressed the present challenge faced by artistes, as creative works are subject to various criminal laws. To address this issue, he proposed a programme where films and television productions would be submitted to the Classification Board before enforcement. President Wickremesinghe expressed the Government’s expectation to implement these measures starting next year. The President also highlighted the imperative need for Sri Lankan cinema to achieve global acclaim. In pursuit of this objective, the Government is actively involved in the comprehensive restructuring of the National Film Corporation and its affiliated institutions to seamlessly integrate with cutting-edge technologies. This year’s Presidential Film Awards ceremony holds special importance as it marks a return after a three-year hiatus. Out of 42 films screened in 2019 and 2020, a total of 44 awards were bestowed on actors and technicians. These awards were carefully selected by a jury comprising expert film critics and seven honorary doctors and professors. Additionally, nine more awards were presented during the ceremony, adding to the prestige of the occasion. During the event, Dr. Nanda Malani was honoured as the Best Playback Singer of 2020.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

This was when the case of the mysterious death of its former Director Dinesh Schaffter, was taken up. The Additional Magistrate stated that it was her view, that withholding the insurance payment to the relevant parties was not necessary anymore. She added that it was also her opinion that no other outside party, has attempted to obtain the compensation thus far. The Court had imposed the said injunction, following a request made by the CID. The CID had informed the Court, at the previous hearing, that as Schaffter’s demise has been proved to be an act of murder, it would be beneficial to the ongoing investigations, if an injunction is imposed for seven days, on the Insurance Companies, preventing them, from paying the requisite compensation, to the parties concerned. The millionaire businessman, who was found unconscious being tied to his car seat at the Borella Cemetery, was later admitted to the National Hospital, Colombo and died on 16 December, last year. Later, complaints were lodged by the family members of the victim, to the Borella Police and the CID, that they were suspicious of the circumstances of Schaffter’s death. Subsequently, Additional Magistrate Jayasuriya formed a five-member panel of forensic medical specialists, to probe in detail, the cause of death of the late businessman. The panel of forensic medical specialists later deemed, in their report to Court, that the death of the businessman concerned, had been a murder. The Court thereafter ordered the CID, to arrest suspects behind the crime and produce them in Court at the previous hearing. The remains of Dinesh Schaffter, which were exhumed, as per a Court order and kept at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Galle, for the fresh post-mortem, conducted by the panel of forensic medical specialists, were reburied at the Jawatta Public Cemetery, on 4 November.

According to Sumanthiran the purportedly embezzled funds are stashed abroad and he emphasised the need to remit this money to the Treasury to kickstart the economic recovery. He also insisted that every Sri Lankan citizen has the right to demand compensation and urged the Rajapaksas to bring the allegedly misappropriated funds back to Sri Lanka for the collective benefit of the nation’s economy. The ITAK MP made these remarks during the second reading debate of the Appropriation Bill 2024.  Speaking further, he raised objections to the President’s budget proposals. He contended that, according to the Constitution, matters of public finance were exclusively within the purview of Parliament.  Sumanthiran argued that an MP, who is not accountable to Parliament, should hold the position of Minister of Finance. He maintained that the President, not being an MP should not be entrusted with this portfolio, despite having the ability to attend sessions and respond to questions. BY Buwanaka S. Perera"

He said, “The COPE chairman, using hand signals, advised SLC members not to answer questions raised by MPs at Tuesday’s meeting. This was clearly visible in the videos being circulated over social media.” Chaos erupted in the Chamber as some committee members represent the Opposition and COPE chairman, Ranjith Bandara, exchanged accusations of mishandling the investigation into Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). Certain COPE members advocated for the temporary removal of Prof. Bandara from the committee’s chairmanship until the SLC probe concluded. SJB MP Hesha Vithanage insisted that Prof. Bandara should not lead future probes on SLC, scheduled for 24, 27, and 28 November. “COPE has summoned SLC, and we requested that Prof. Bandara be removed temporarily and replaced with an acting chairman,” he added. MP S.M. Marikkar expressed reluctance, along with other COPE members, to participate in SLC probes under Prof. Bandara’s chairmanship. Accusing Professor Bandara of violating COPE members’ privileges, MP Chaminda Wijesiri suggested, “The COPE Chairman could be dealt with under Section 18 of the Privileges Act.” MP Premanath Dollawatta also called for the temporary removal of the COPE Chairman. In response, Prof. Bandara accused Opposition members of politicising the probe, stating, “COPE was expected to be independent as far as possible. However, there was a planned effort by Opposition members to politicise the probe on SLC.” Defending his actions, he added, “I put my fingers on my lips and asked the opposition MPs to be quiet as many members were speaking at the same time.” However, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana refrained from issuing any ruling on the matter. Meanwhile, Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe urged the Speaker to establish a distinct Parliamentary Committee, headed by an Opposition MP to undertake an inquiry into SLC as opposed to the ongoing investigations conducted by COPE.  Ransinghe expressed dissatisfaction with the COPE proceedings, asserting that during the summoning of SLC before COPE, irrelevant points were deliberated upon while crucial and pertinent issues were overlooked. “Based on the video footage of the COPE meeting on Tuesday (15), it is evident that discussions veered towards irrelevant subjects, sidestepping crucial and pertinent matters. I am sceptical if the COPE has been compromised in its dealings with SLC,” he alleged. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts.

The countries where vigils took place included Australia, Bangladesh, Croatia, France, India, Israel, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, UAE, USA, and UK, say the organisers, Southasia Peace Action Network, a cross-regional, cross-diasporic peace alliance, and the nonprofit Confederation of Voluntary Associations (COVA) based in Hyderabad, India. Nearly 50 participating organisations around the world and dozens of individuals are listed at the Southasia Peace website. Former Indian Navy Chief Admiral L. Ramdas and his life partner, the well known activist Lalita Ramdas, participated from their current base in Secunderabad, a twin city of Hyderabad in the heart of India. “We did our ten minutes of meditation for peace on Sunday 12 November Diwali, from 11.30 to 11.40 am,” Lalita Ramdas told Sapan News. She said, she explained to two caregivers – one a Christian and one a Muslim – “about the need for this joint silent prayer, and how many people were joining from across the world, and the power of such collective efforts to build a world of peace and love” they said and added “We were happy to join, and said it was a lovely feeling of calm that they experienced.”  The historic city of Hyderabad saw participation in the Global Vigil at two separate events. One was Remembrance Day, commemorated to honour soldiers of Hyderabad Lancers and other Commonwealth nations who lost their lives during World War I. Some 40 participants joined in a guided meditation and prayers of different faiths at the event, organised by the British Deputy High Commission in Hyderabad. They included diplomats, bureaucrats, faith leaders, professionals, academics, activists and journalists. The second venue for the Global Virtual Vigil in Hyderabad was at Anuraga Nilayam, a home for elders, where some 40 residents along with 35 guests including children and women also joined in the Global Virtual Vigil. Representing the Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Parsi faiths, residents also participated in multifaith celebrations for Diwali, Mahavir Nirvana Jains and Gurpurab Gurta Gaddi Sri Guru Granth Saheb Ji with prayers of different faiths, bhajans (devotional songs) and firecra ckers. Participants spoke about why the different festivals are celebrated that promote core human values. The programme concluded with multifaith culinary offerings, as is fitting in a city that is famous for its cuisine. (Sapan News)"

The Apex Court also deemed in its verdict that the actions resorted to by each of the aforementioned politicians had also flouted the Fundamental Rights of the citizens. On that account, the country’s highest Court ruled that the three Rajapaksa brothers, as well as former Central Bank Governors Ajith Nivard Cabraal and Prof. W.D. Lakshman, former Treasury Secretary S.R. Attygalle, former Presidential Secretary P.B. Jayasundera and the Monetary Board members of the CBSL, had violated the Fundamental Rights of the people. The Supreme Court thus instructed the respondents, to pay the petitioners, Court fees amounting to Rs 150,000. The aforesaid ruling was delivered, based on the majority view of the five-Judge Bench, presided over by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, in respect of two FR petitions filed by the former head of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Chandra Jayaratne, former ace swimmer Julian Bolling, Prof. Mahima Mendis of the Open University and several others. The Apex Court Bench also comprised Justices Murdu Fernando, Vijith Malalgoda, Buwaneka Aluvihare and Priyantha Jayawardena. Justice Jayawardena, elaborating on the minority verdict of the Bench, mentioned that he was ordering for the invalidation of the petition, due to it not being filed during the requisite time period and as well due to a few other reasons. Explaining the majority view of the SC Bench, Chief Justice Jayasuriya, stressed that the respondents concerned, had held responsible posts within the Government, from November 2019 up to August last year. He observed that during the period in question, though the respondents mentioned had been aware of an imminent economic meltdown here, it had come to light during testimony, that they had not taken any concrete measures, to overcome that economic downturn. Chief Justice Jayasuriya, continuing, noted that as a result of the actions of the respondents concerned, the country had faced a crisis situation, with masses being unable to obtain essential services, such as electricity, gas, fuel, medicine etc and it had dragged the nation, into a veritable economic precipice. He added in the verdict, that despite constant warnings given to the respondents by the IMF, of an impending economic disaster in the country, the respondents had failed to pay heed to it. The Chief Justice also emphasised, that the Bench, was not prepared to accept the stance taken by the respondents that they had taken adequate precautions, to ward off an economic upheaval here.  The Supreme Court Bench lastly maintained, in its majority verdict, that the actions resorted to by the respondents concerned, had proven beyond a shadow of doubt, that they had acted in an irresponsible manner, whilst eroding the implicit trust placed in them by the public. The Court thus determined that the actions of the respondents, had violated the Fundamental Rights of the citizens, guaranteed in the Constitution. The petitioners had sought an investigation into the State officials responsible for the economic crisis. A panel of lawyers, including President’s Counsels Upul Jayasuriya and Chandana Jayasundara, appeared for the petitioners, while President’s Counsels Gamini Marapana, Shavindra Fernando and Anura Meddegoda PC represented the respondents.  Furthermore, Additional Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appeared for several respondents, including the Attorney General.

He said their commitment to truth led to their exit from politics, making it their strongest standpoint. However, this strength was being bolstered by the influx of new faces, while other Government and opposition parties are also gearing up for the presidential contest. In a meeting with over 30 media representatives, at the Presidential Secretariat, he highlighted that a majority in Parliament supports the need for a strong Government, acknowledging the public’s desire to overcome the ongoing crisis. “I came alone, but we are three in the UNP and we cannot navigate this path independently. We require support from others. I seek that support, and together, we will progress,” stressed the President, who faced numerous questions during the session. He noted the positive outcomes achieved thus far and underscored the necessity for collaborative efforts to move forward. “My first job is to ensure the termination of bankruptcy. Once we’ve achieved that, we’ll unveil new plans and then assess our next steps. My presence here is to seek your support primarily in ending bankruptcy. We are nearing that, and I wish to navigate this without political contention or debate,” he said. “On the land issue concerning the upcountry plantation matter, the President said he wanted all regional plantation companies (RPCs) to involve the workers as tea out-growers. While acknowledging that some companies’ were moving in that direction, he said he wanted all companies to adopt the out-growers scheme following which they would negotiate as the land belonged to RPCs. Some companies are reluctant but I urge everyone to transit to out-growers. The government is undergoing a transformation in land ownership matters,” he pointed out.  “We have done away with the remnants of the Waste Land Ordinance, where all uncultivated lands are State-owned. He said even government officials were hesitant to grant freehold rights to the people. We’ve revoked the freehold status and are now reforming the entire landscape of government-owned land. Our focus is to provide ownership to those holding land development ordinance permits; it marks the first instance of such ownership being granted,” he added.   He expressed his intent to initiate negotiations after its implementation, stating, “The tea companies may perceive limited options, but I urge everyone to transit to out-growers.” “Our focus is to provide ownership to those holding land development ordinance permits; it marks the first instance of such ownership being granted,” the President said. He highlighted that Sri Lanka’s current situation was notably “much better than Gaza” and the country was moving forward. This he said, in response to the question related to the ethnic and religious divide in the North and the East over land and archeological sites that hampers the national reconciliation process the Government is keen on resolving.  The President emphasised on land matters, saying the Government was adhering to the 1985 Sri Lanka map regarding land disputes. “Where debates arise concerning land usage our decision is clear: if it’s a village on the 1985 map, it remains so,; if it’s designated as a forest, it retains that classification. We’re actively working to resolve these matters.”  Concerning the disputed Kurdundumalai Temple, the President said he had meetings with priests from different faiths, who expressed willingness to find common ground. “I have asked the Police to take action if any outsiders come to the site and create disturbances.”  He also highlighted empowering provincial committees in education, agricultural modernisation, tourism, and export industries, particularly for entities with turnovers of under Rs 600 million. These measures are implemented across all provinces, including the North, he said. Additionally, the President stated he was engaging with MPs regularly to resolve issues. When asked when would the projected end of the IMF loan facility, which was said to end by December 2023, but did not look so, the President responded that December had not concluded yet. He added that discussions with development partners were on, including China, which has presented successful proposals. ‘The IMF meeting is scheduled for 6 December.“Let’s wait and see what transpires by the end of December after the IMF meeting. Subsequently, we will engage with other development partners and explore opportunities with other partners and private partnerships once the IMF process concludes,” he said."

The President, unaware of the sports minister’s decision, formed the ministerial sub-committee to investigate the matter, with the consent of both the Sports Minister and the President. However, on 7 November, the Court of Appeal issued a 14-day stay order, preventing the operation of the Interim Committee and the relevant gazette notification, following a writ petition filed by SLC president Shammi Silva.

All four persons, a married couple and their two daughters, who were reported missing after the landslide in Gavaranhena in Balangoda on Sunday (12), were found during a search operation conducted with the assistance of disaster management officials, Sri Lanka Army personnel and local residents. Though the verdict into the Magisterial Inquest and Post-Mortem into the victim’s death was due to be delivered in Court yesterday, the Additional Magistrate deferred the announcement of the verdict to 27 November, due to not receiving the JMO’s report. The hearing of testimony, into the post-mortem on Kotelawela’s death, concluded at the previous hearing and thus far eight witnesses have testified in Court. A case had been filed before the said Court, following a complaint lodged with the Bambalapitiya Police, by Sherin Wijeratne, a sister of the deceased’s wife, who alleged that she was highly suspicious, of her brother-in-law’s death. During the post-mortem, it had been revealed that Kotelawela had passed away, while being treated at a private hospice in Colombo, on 21 October. The witnesses had mentioned, during testimony, that though the former head of the Seylinco Group had resided at the address No. 28, Elibank Road, Colombo 5, he had been forcibly removed to the address No. 13, Dickman Lane, Colombo 4, at the behest of a few who had served under him, at which point they had detained him against his wishes. They added during evidence, that two groups of persons, who had previously served under Kotelawela, had forcibly taken hold of his property and that they had detained him in that manner, at the Dickman Lane address, to accomplish their ulterior motives.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

A discussion was held at the Ministry of Agriculture with the participation of Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, Mahinda Amaraweera and Minister of Transport and Mass Media, Dr. Bandula Gunawardana, where approval was given to implement the project as soon as possible. Although there is high demand for strawberries in the world market, there is still minimal demand for strawberries grown in our country because they are not cultivated using modern technology. Sri Lanka is ranked 57th among strawberry-exporting countries. Strawberries have a rapidly increasing market annually and are an extremely popular soft fruit. It was agreed to provide one hectare of land belonging to the Ministry of Agriculture in Nuwara Eliya under the first phase of the pilot project. According to the success of the project, up to 10 hectares can be given for strawberry cultivation if needed. By using the new technology, if strawberries are cultivated, it is possible to earn an income of USD 117,600 from one hectare per year. It is also possible to get a yield of 120,000 kg from one hectare. Also, the amount invested to cultivate one hectare is Rs 250 million. Amaraweera said the upliftment of agriculture will be prioritised next year. The Minister also mentioned that the President has made a great contribution to the agriculture of this country by presenting the new Budget proposals.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/11/15/correlation-between-physical-education-and-human-wellness/,Correlation between Physical Education and Human Wellness,Author not found,0,2023-11-14T20:31:00+00:00," Physical Education (PE) is a field of study that focuses on the development of physical fitness and the ability to perform physical activities. It is an essential component of the education system, aiming to promote lifelong health and well-being through regular physical activity. The key aspects of physical education include:  a) Physical Fitness: PE programmes often include activities and exercises designed to improve cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, and overall physical health. b) Skill Development: Physical education classes teach students a variety of motor skills and sports-related activities. This can include team sports like soccer, basketball and volleyball, as well as individual activities like running, swimming, and gymnastics. c) Health Education: PE is not just about physical activity; it also involves educating students about the importance of a healthy lifestyle. It includes discussions about nutrition, the effects of exercise on mental health, and the prevention of injuries.  d) Lifelong Physical Activity: The goal of physical education is not only to promote fitness during the school years but also to instil a love for physical activity that will continue throughout a person’s life. This can contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases associated with a sedentary lifestyle.  e) Social Skills: Many physical education activities involve teamwork and cooperation, promoting social skills and the ability to work effectively with others. Team sports, in particular, provide opportunities for leadership and communication development.  f) Cognitive Benefits: Physical activity has been linked to improved cognitive function and academic performance. Regular exercise is believed to enhance concentration, memory, and the ability to learn.  g) Healthy Habits: By emphasising the importance of regular physical activity, physical education programmes encourage the development of healthy habits that can carry over into adulthood. Physical education is typically a mandatory part of primary and secondary education in many countries. Aims and objectives The purpose of physical education (PE) is multifaceted and extends beyond merely engaging in physical activities. The primary objectives of physical education include: a) Promoting Physical Fitness: One of the central purposes of PE is to enhance and maintain physical fitness. Physical activities and exercises are designed to improve cardiovascular health, muscular strength, flexibility, and overall well-being. b) Developing Motor Skills: PE focuses on the development of fundamental motor skills such as running, jumping, throwing, and catching. These skills are foundational for more advanced physical activities and contribute to overall coordination and movement proficiency.  c) Encouraging a Healthy Lifestyle: Physical education aims to instil the importance of a healthy and active lifestyle. By engaging in regular physical activity during childhood and adolescence, individuals are more likely to adopt and maintain healthy habits throughout their lives.  d) Preventing Health Issues: Regular physical activity has been associated with a reduced risk of various health issues, including obesity, heart disease, and certain mental health disorders. PE contributes to the prevention of sedentary lifestyles and associated health problems.  e) Teaching Sportsmanship and Teamwork: Many physical education activities involve team sports, which provide opportunities to learn about sportsmanship, cooperation, leadership, and effective communication. These skills are valuable not only in sports but also in various aspects of life. f) Building Social Skills: Physical education often involves group activities, fostering social interaction and teamwork. Students learn to work together, resolve conflicts, and develop interpersonal skills that are essential for successful collaboration in various contexts.  g) Cultivating Lifelong Habits: The goal of physical education is to instil a love for physical activity that extends beyond the school years. By promoting enjoyable and varied forms of exercise, PE encourages individuals to adopt and maintain an active lifestyle throughout their lives.  h) Providing Enjoyable Physical Experiences: Physical education should be enjoyable and provide students with positive experiences related to physical activity. This can contribute to a positive attitude towards exercise and a lifelong appreciation for maintaining good health. In summary, the purpose of physical education is to contribute to the holistic development of individuals by promoting physical fitness, motor skill development, healthy lifestyles, and positive social and cognitive outcomes. It plays a crucial role in shaping attitudes and behaviours related to physical activity, ultimately impacting the overall well-being of individuals. Physical education and health Physical education (PE) and health education are closely related fields, often overlapping in their goals and objectives.

The e-billing initiative is set to roll out initially in Dehiwala, Kelaniya, Sri Jayewardenepura, Matara and Ambalangoda. Residents in these areas will exclusively receive their electricity bills in a digital format, either through SMS or email. Noel Priyantha emphasised the importance of consumers nationwide swiftly registering for this convenient service, as the issuance of printed paper bills will be gradually phased out in the coming months. To register, consumers can simply send an SMS with the message ‘REG’ followed by their CEB account number to 1987. Alternatively, online registration is available at http://ebill.ceb.lk, where users can follow the provided instructions. The CEB seeks the cooperation of consumers across the country to ensure the seamless implementation of the e-billing system, which is anticipated to save approximately 100 million sheets of paper annually. This eco-friendly transition aligns with broader sustainability goals and signifies a positive step towards reducing environmental impact."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The key aspects of physical education include:  a) Physical Fitness: PE programmes often include activities and exercises designed to improve cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, and overall physical health. b) Skill Development: Physical education classes teach students a variety of motor skills and sports-related activities. This can include team sports like soccer, basketball and volleyball, as well as individual activities like running, swimming, and gymnastics. c) Health Education: PE is not just about physical activity; it also involves educating students about the importance of a healthy lifestyle. It includes discussions about nutrition, the effects of exercise on mental health, and the prevention of injuries.  d) Lifelong Physical Activity: The goal of physical education is not only to promote fitness during the school years but also to instil a love for physical activity that will continue throughout a person’s life. This can contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases associated with a sedentary lifestyle.  e) Social Skills: Many physical education activities involve teamwork and cooperation, promoting social skills and the ability to work effectively with others. Team sports, in particular, provide opportunities for leadership and communication development.  f) Cognitive Benefits: Physical activity has been linked to improved cognitive function and academic performance. Regular exercise is believed to enhance concentration, memory, and the ability to learn.  g) Healthy Habits: By emphasising the importance of regular physical activity, physical education programmes encourage the development of healthy habits that can carry over into adulthood. Physical education is typically a mandatory part of primary and secondary education in many countries. Aims and objectives The purpose of physical education (PE) is multifaceted and extends beyond merely engaging in physical activities. The primary objectives of physical education include: a) Promoting Physical Fitness: One of the central purposes of PE is to enhance and maintain physical fitness. Physical activities and exercises are designed to improve cardiovascular health, muscular strength, flexibility, and overall well-being. b) Developing Motor Skills: PE focuses on the development of fundamental motor skills such as running, jumping, throwing, and catching. These skills are foundational for more advanced physical activities and contribute to overall coordination and movement proficiency.  c) Encouraging a Healthy Lifestyle: Physical education aims to instil the importance of a healthy and active lifestyle. By engaging in regular physical activity during childhood and adolescence, individuals are more likely to adopt and maintain healthy habits throughout their lives.  d) Preventing Health Issues: Regular physical activity has been associated with a reduced risk of various health issues, including obesity, heart disease, and certain mental health disorders. PE contributes to the prevention of sedentary lifestyles and associated health problems.  e) Teaching Sportsmanship and Teamwork: Many physical education activities involve team sports, which provide opportunities to learn about sportsmanship, cooperation, leadership, and effective communication. These skills are valuable not only in sports but also in various aspects of life. f) Building Social Skills: Physical education often involves group activities, fostering social interaction and teamwork. Students learn to work together, resolve conflicts, and develop interpersonal skills that are essential for successful collaboration in various contexts.  g) Cultivating Lifelong Habits: The goal of physical education is to instil a love for physical activity that extends beyond the school years. By promoting enjoyable and varied forms of exercise, PE encourages individuals to adopt and maintain an active lifestyle throughout their lives.  h) Providing Enjoyable Physical Experiences: Physical education should be enjoyable and provide students with positive experiences related to physical activity. This can contribute to a positive attitude towards exercise and a lifelong appreciation for maintaining good health. In summary, the purpose of physical education is to contribute to the holistic development of individuals by promoting physical fitness, motor skill development, healthy lifestyles, and positive social and cognitive outcomes. It plays a crucial role in shaping attitudes and behaviours related to physical activity, ultimately impacting the overall well-being of individuals. Physical education and health Physical education (PE) and health education are closely related fields, often overlapping in their goals and objectives.

He criticised the Government’s failure to meet the revenue targets outlined in the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) agreement, leading to the inability to secure the second tranche from the IMF. Premadasa characterised the presented budget as “primitive” due to these financial shortcomings. Premadasa made these remarks during a media briefing, following the President’s Budget proposals for the year 2024 in Parliament yesterday (13). He accused the President of attempting to deceive the public and suggested that the President’s references in the speech depicted a luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by the current government’s leaders. The Opposition Leader emphasised the need for the government to fulfil promises made in the 2022 budget before introducing new programmes to benefit working-class citizens in the current budget. He highlighted challenges in implementing previous budget promises, citing various reasons for the difficulties faced. Referring to a statement from the Presidential Media Unit (PMD), Premadasa noted a discrepancy between the living expense allowance mentioned in the budget proposal (from 7,000 to 17,000) and the PMD announcement (from 7,500 to 10,000). He alleged that certain aspects of the budget speech were leaked to the media before being presented to MPs, raising concerns about parliamentary supremacy. Premadasa contended that the entire 2024 budget was part of a propaganda campaign in favour of the government for upcoming elections. By Buwanaka S. Perera"

Addressing the media, after President Ranil Wickremesinghe delivered the 2024 Budget Speech in Parliament, MP Rajapaksa questioned whether these repeated proposals had been effectively implemented at the grassroots level. Expressing skepticism, he remarked, “It raises questions as to whether this year’s budget will merely be confined to a speech.” MP Rajapaksa indicated that his party would scrutinise the budget’s details in the upcoming period and would present their observations during the parliamentary debate. He hinted at the possibility of suggesting alternative ideas and policies during this process, with a keen interest on whether the President would be receptive to these proposals. Highlighting the significance of their party’s policies being integrated into the budget proposals, Rajapaksa emphasised that, given the Finance Minister’s role within the SLPP government, the budget should reflect their overarching policies and priorities.

According to the MP, government employees will receive the allowance of Rs 10,000 starting from April, and pensioners will also have to wait until April to receive their allowance of Rs 2,500. Professor Peiris highlighted the surge in the cost of living, attributing it to the increase of Value Added Tax (VAT) before presenting the budget 2024. He further mentioned that the prices of all goods would increase from today due to VAT. Professor Peiris emphasised the gravity of the situation, noting that 700,000 people are currently affected, and there is no resolution to these issues in this year’s budget. Methmalie Dissanayake"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/11/14/sc-rules-commercial-banks-entitled-to-parate-law/,SC rules commercial banks entitled to parate law,Author not found,0,2023-11-13T20:33:00+00:00," The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, yesterday (13), has overturned the ruling of the five-Judge Supreme Court Bench in the case of Chelliah v Ramachandran and held that banks are entitled to parate execution concerning any property mortgaged to them. Parate execution, rooted in Roman Dutch Law, grants licensed commercial banks the authority to sell mortgaged property as collateral without Court intervention. The Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act of 1990 expanded this power to all private commercial banks, aiming to enhance the security and flexibility of the banking system by expediting debt recovery and discouraging deliberate defaults. In the Chelliah v Ramachandran case, a prior decision by five judges of the Supreme Court (four to one) concluded that banks were not entitled to parate execution when the property had been mortgaged by a person other than the actual borrower. This decision significantly prejudiced the banks, causing a halt in the recovery process for the money lent and due to be repaid, leading to a substantial impediment in the circulation of money. Given these adverse circumstances, Counsel petitioned for a reconsideration of the Chelliah v Ramachandran judgment to a seven-Judge Supreme Court bench. The bench, comprising Justices Buwaneka Aluwihare, Murdu N.B. Fernando, S. Thurairaja, E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, A.H.M.D. Nawaz, Kumudini Wickremasinghe, and Mahinda Samayawardhena, unanimously held that the majority judgment in Chelliah v Ramachandran was incorrect and, therefore, overruled it. Justice Nawaz and Justice Samayawardene, who wrote lengthy and separate judgments highlighted the rival arguments in the appeal, with the Appellant’s counsel asserting the correctness of the majority decision, while the banks’ counsel, led by Dr. Romesh de Silva, PC, contended that the judgment in was wrong. Dr. De Silva PC emphasised the importance of a stable financial system for economic development, stressing the need for uninterrupted money circulation. Justice Samayawardhena acknowledged that a stable financial system is crucial for robust economic development, facilitating resource allocation, credit access, risk management, and overall growth. He noted the banks’ role as guardians of public funds within the Sri Lankan financial system, emphasising the necessity of a secure payment and repayment system. Furthermore, Justice Nawaz asserted that with the Court’s determination that Chelliah Ramachandran perpetuated an incorrect view of parate execution concerning third-party mortgages, the precedent set by Chelliah Ramachandran would no longer be followed. Justice Nawaz critiqued Chief Justice Sarath N Silva’s statement in Chelliah Ramchandran, asserting that undue focus on the disfavour Roman Dutch Law had for parate execution is akin to looking backward and compared it to the biblical story of Lot’s wife turning into a pillar of salt. He emphasised the need for Sri Lankan jurisprudence to progress and not be bound by historical perspectives. Referring to the SARFAESI Act of India,  he argued that Sri Lankan law should align itself with global credit financing practices and not lag behind. Justice Nawaz further stated that time has come to perform the burial rites of the Chelliah- Ramchandran case. Justice Amarasekara concurred, supporting the final conclusion that, regardless of whether a loan was released in the name of the mortgager, a mortgaged property is subject to parate execution. The unanimous decision overruled the earlier five-judge ruling in Chelliah v Ramachandran, affirming that banks are entitled to parate execution for any property mortgaged to them.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Emphasising the need for prudent water management, the minister urged farmers to use reservoir water judiciously, citing international weather forecasts confirming an impending drought. Addressing the water crisis, the Sri Lanka Hadabima Authority recently took a proactive step by presenting essential equipment sets to 70 farming families in the Hambantota District to boost passion fruit cultivation. The distribution, which took place last Saturday (11), was officiated by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and attended by Sri Lanka Hadabima Authority Chairman Sarath Chandrasiri Withana. Reflecting on the challenges faced in the previous Yala season, Minister Amaraweera acknowledged the significant impact of El Nino-induced drought, resulting in the destruction of 65,000 acres of high-yielding paddy fields. Furthermore, heavy post-drought rains led to the flooding and ruin of an additional 11,000 acres of nearly ripe paddy fields. Despite recent rainfall, the minister cautioned that the situation may not persist due to anticipated weather conditions, specifically La Nina, expected by the end of December. This could exacerbate the drought, posing a threat to crop cultivation in the upcoming Yala season. Highlighting the urgency of water conservation, Minister Amaraweera stressed the importance of timely cultivation. He noted that compensation for crop damage would not be extended to fields left uncultivated within the recommended timeframe. The minister urged farmers to heed the warnings and take proactive measures to mitigate the potential impact on crops. In an effort to diversify agricultural practices, the Sri Lanka Hadabima Authority initiated a programme to promote passion fruit cultivation in the Hambantota District, benefiting 70 selected farming families. Minister Amaraweera underscored the importance of such initiatives, noting the global demand for passion fruit and the suitability of dry weather conditions for its cultivation. The Hadabima Authority not only provided necessary equipment but also offered training and supervision to ensure cultivation meets international standards. Similar projects are also underway in other regions, such as Dehiattakandiya, as the government seeks to enhance crop diversity and resilience in the face of challenging weather patterns."

Speaking at an exclusive awareness programme organised for the media in Colombo, Dr. Ludowyke emphasised the crucial role of media cooperation and support in raising awareness about the harms of tobacco and alcohol. He acknowledged that the reduction in smoking rates in the country could be credited to the collaborative efforts of the media and NATA.

In a game of the highest quality in treacherous conditions, fortunes swung both ways. City thought they had the three points when Rodri’s shot from the edge of the area touched off Thiago Silva past Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez with four minutes left. Chelsea, showing superb resilience, were not to be denied and Palmer – a £40m summer signing from Pep Guardiola’s side – stayed cool amid the mayhem to beat Ederson from the spot to leave City just a point clear of Liverpool at the Premier League summit. The reigning champions led in contentious fashion after 25 minutes when they were awarded a penalty for Marc Cucurella’s pull on Erling Haaland, despite Chelsea’s protests that the full-back had been fouled first. Haaland dispatched the penalty with ease, but the hosts were level four minutes later when Brazil centre-back Silva glanced home Conor Gallagher’s corner at the near post. Chelsea turned the game around when Raheem Sterling also scored against his former club after 37 minutes, turning in Reece James’ cross after Josko Gvardiol’s mistake. City, though, levelled on the stroke of half-time when the unmarked Manuel Akanji headed in Bernardo Silva’s cross. Two minutes after the break City went in front again when Haaland scrambled in Julian Alvarez’s cross at the far post. Yet Chelsea again battled back and deservedly drew level in the 67th minute when Nicolas Jackson pounced after Ederson pushed out Gallagher’s low drive. Guardiola’s side thought they had won it with Rodri’s stroke of good fortune – until the late penalty drama capped an entertaining, eventful encounter.

Kumudesh accused the SPC of attempting to take decisions outside the box by conferring a person, who had qualifications in finance and accounting, a position in laboratory and technical services, at a time when it was not even possible to trace the root cause of fake immunoglobulin scam, which occurred due to wrong recommendations made by the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC). The AHP President alleged that the biggest problem lay in the fact that while the SPC had transferred the DGM Finance to the Acting Deputy General Manager position yet another unsuitable appointment could be made to fill his post in Finance. “It is very clear that an unseen hand in the SPC was working strategically to pave the way for informal and irregular transactions, he alleged. Kumudesh said that the AHP and all other trade unions were watchful as to whether the approval of the new Health Minister had been obtained when making these decisions.

Dr. Ludowyke, citing a 2020 World Health Organisation (WHO) report, on tobacco-related deaths, highlighted that 50 per cent of chain smokers succumb to lung-related diseases, including lung and oral cancer. Sri Lanka, he noted, has become a global front-runner in reducing the number of smokers, an achievement attributed to the effective awareness programmes conducted by NATA. Speaking at an exclusive awareness programme organised for the media in Colombo, Dr. Ludowyke emphasised the crucial role of media cooperation and support in raising awareness about the harms of tobacco and alcohol. He acknowledged that the reduction in smoking rates in the country could be credited to the collaborative efforts of the media and NATA. Police Spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa, addressing the event, asserted that issues related to tobacco or other crimes cannot be entirely eradicated but can only be kept under control. He emphasised the importance of ongoing efforts to manage such issues. Attorney-at-Law Viraj Bandaranayake, the Legal Adviser to NATA, revealed the organisation’s continuous campaign against narcotics, including cannabis and their efforts to educate the public about the health risks involved. Bandaranayake disclosed that he had discussions with the Parliamentary Select Committee, urging them not to promote cannabis cultivation in Sri Lanka due to its harmful impact on the nation’s health. Prof. Duminda Guruge, from the Health Promotion Unit of the University of Rajarata, also addressed the awareness programme, focusing on the same theme. The collaborative efforts of NATA, law enforcement, and the media underscore the importance of sustained initiatives to combat tobacco-related issues and promote public health. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

In a game of the highest quality in treacherous conditions, fortunes swung both ways. City thought they had the three points when Rodri’s shot from the edge of the area touched off Thiago Silva past Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez with four minutes left. Chelsea, showing superb resilience, were not to be denied and Palmer – a £40m summer signing from Pep Guardiola’s side – stayed cool amid the mayhem to beat Ederson from the spot to leave City just a point clear of Liverpool at the Premier League summit. The reigning champions led in contentious fashion after 25 minutes when they were awarded a penalty for Marc Cucurella’s pull on Erling Haaland, despite Chelsea’s protests that the full-back had been fouled first. Haaland dispatched the penalty with ease, but the hosts were level four minutes later when Brazil centre-back Silva glanced home Conor Gallagher’s corner at the near post. Chelsea turned the game around when Raheem Sterling also scored against his former club after 37 minutes, turning in Reece James’ cross after Josko Gvardiol’s mistake. City, though, levelled on the stroke of half-time when the unmarked Manuel Akanji headed in Bernardo Silva’s cross. Two minutes after the break City went in front again when Haaland scrambled in Julian Alvarez’s cross at the far post. Yet Chelsea again battled back and deservedly drew level in the 67th minute when Nicolas Jackson pounced after Ederson pushed out Gallagher’s low drive. Guardiola’s side thought they had won it with Rodri’s stroke of good fortune – until the late penalty drama capped an entertaining, eventful encounter. Defender Ruben Dias was penalised for a foul on Chelsea substitute Armando Broja and Palmer’s calm finish left honours even."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

This discussion was initiated by Keith D. Bernard, Chairman SLPA, and was attended by local industrial experts and stakeholder groups operating in the port sector. The discussion focused on how DFC can fund projects, explore ways to finance private sector driven renewable energy projects  at ports, seeking potential investors and interested groups to work together on the Green initiative, etc. During the meeting, Keith D. Bernard, the Chairman of SLPA, emphasised the significant potential in working in collaboration to achieve success in making the port green and eco-friendly. He highlighted the importance of this initial discussion to pave the way for the future. “As a country, we are committed to power our ports with green energy in the future,” he said. He mentioned that SLPA would look at updating the Sri Lanka Ports National Master Plan by incorporating green energy initiatives. Capt. Nirmal P. Silva, SLPA’s Harbour Master, stressed the growing interest in green energy in the Ports and Maritime sector.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

The humiliating performance by the Sri Lanka Men’s National Cricket Team, at ICC Men’s World Cup 2023, had sparked many a debate in the country and Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa presented the joint proposal to the House yesterday (9) morning.  It was seconded by Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva. The Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) MPs, who participated in the debate, were not present in the Chamber when the proposal was passed. The motion, titled ‘Removal of corrupt Office-Bearers including President from Sri Lanka Cricket’, was debated from 9.30 a.m. until 5.30 p.m., as determined by the Committee on Parliamentary Affairs on Wednesday (8). The proposal emphasised the need for the Office-Bearers of Sri Lanka Cricket to step down and called for the enactment of new legislation, through a new Act, to ensure transparent and corruption-free governance of cricket. When the debate was concluded, the main Opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) wanted to call for a Division. However, Despite the opposition’s repeated requests for a vote by name, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena proceeded with the resolution, claiming that both government and opposition MPs had agreed to its passage. The Speaker’s decision received angry remarks from the Opposition MPs who accused the Speaker of obstructing a vote on the debate to remove SLC officials. SJB MP Harsha de Silva expressed disappointment and stated, “Another blow to democracy in Sri Lanka. The Speaker refused repeated requests for a division, which would allow a vote by name, on the debate to remove the board of Sri Lanka Cricket on charges of gross corruption. Instead, the motion was passed without a vote, potentially concealing a significant division within the government.” Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe, making a strong statement, urged that expeditious measures be taken to suspend the passports of the SLC office bearers. One of them has already left the country. There is no point in closing the stable doors once the horse has bolted, he stressed. He also alleged that a colossal sum of SLC money has been deposited in three foreign bank accounts without obtaining the approval of Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). The Opposition Leader requested to freeze all the bank accounts belonging to SLC. During the debate, Minister Kanchana Wijesekera who was a member of the Cabinet Sub- committee, appointed to overlook the SLC functions, in response to the resolution being presented, issued a warning, stating that the responsibility for any potential ban to SLC, imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), would lie with the Parliament,. It was also reported that President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who met the government MPs in Parliament also highlighted the risk of an ICC ban on SLC. The President who requested to support the joint-proposal, had reportedly told the MPs that he does not represent any party, but the country’s game of cricket. “We are the World Cup winners and we have to restore that glory. I will take all the decisions in my capacity to develop cricket in our country. My only fear is whether we have to face an international ban. I heard that ICC had discussed the current situation,” the President had said. Former President Maithiripala Sirisena stressed the corruption in the SLC is not a new problem. “The corruption at the SCL has been there for a very long time,” Sirisena said.

Several trade unions and associations, lawyers, several post office workers from the neighbouring townships areas and members of civil society joined the protest calling for a halt to the proposed hotel project. The demonstration continued despite the heavy showers and a large number of Police personnel present. The gathering occurred at the Nuwara Eliya Town, where the Post Office is atop a hill.    Asserting the Post Office’s significance as a cherished asset of the people of Sri Lanka, protesters urged the government to reconsider its decision to hand it over to a hotel. They proposed an alternative solution, suggesting that the land behind the Post Office, approximately 30 perches in size, could be allocated for the hotel project, while preserving the historic structure. This, they argued, would contribute to the enduring charm of ‘Little England,’ a concept the country promotes when showcasing Nuwara Eliya to international audiences. The demonstrators holding placards and black flags made powerful statements against the proposed transformation. As the protest paraded around the heart of Nuwara Eliya, all business establishments were closed in solidarity.  The protest caused a temporary roadblock in the town disrupting traffic for about an hour.   The Post Office, adorned with four manually operated clocks on all four sides of the building and featuring rooms available for rent during the April season houses several historical artefacts from the British rule, including the Postmaster’s uniform and vintage writing utensils. This cultural treasure has become a tourist attraction in its own right. Despite the government’s plan to convert it into a hotel, the public is concerned about losing access to the Post Office and its services, a point vehemently contested during the protest. Pic by S.

Though the protesters had planned to stage their demonstration in front of the SLC head office Police informed them that they cannot grant approval for it. The protesters who had planned to arrive at Maitland Place, via the Independence Square, were prevented by the Police, from proceeding to the SLC premises, by placing barricades. Police informed the protesters that they cannot be allowed to go to the SLC office and when they had sought permission to visit the premises one by one, they were turned down again. Riot Police as well as the Armed Forces were summoned to prevent any untoward incidents. Meanwhile, during the course of the protest, a protester had strived to demonstrate against the Government over the country’s worsening health crisis, but the majority of protesters had insisted that they were there to demand the ouster of the SLC office bearers and not over the health crisis. This prompted a heated exchange of words between the protester, protesting over the health crisis and those demanding the resignation of SLC office bearers. Police were then forced to intervene and quell the situation. The protesting cricket fans charged that the protester, who had protested over the health crisis, had been sent by SLC President Shammi Silva to turn the attention of the country to other issues rather than his own predicament. Afterwards, the protesters carried out their demonstration at the entrance to the Independence Avenue via Vidya Mawatha and they peacefully disbursed at around 1.00 p.m. at which point the blocked roads were reopened for traffic by the Police.

According to the Board, there is a high demand for Palmyrah-related products, such as jaggery, toddy, and liquor, both in Sri Lanka and foreign markets, particularly in Canada. Recently, the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera, visited the premises of the Palmyrah Development Board in Weerawila. Various food items and household equipment produced from Palmyrah trees were displayed during the visit. Currently, Sri Lanka has 11 million Palmyra trees, but unfortunately, 60 per cent of them are not being utilised. To address this, the Palmyrah Development Board has initiated special training programmes to educate people on how to promote Palmyrah-related products and gain economic benefits from them, Krishantha Pathiraja, chairman of the Palmyrah Development Board informed Minister Amaraweera. During the war, about 30 per cent of the Palmyrah trees in the Northern and Eastern Provinces were destroyed, but the board has successfully replanted an equal number in recent years. The board had taken steps to plant 200,000 new Palmyrah trees in the last four years, Pathiraja said. By October 2023, the country’s income from the export of Palmyrah-related products is expected to reach 78 million rupees. The international market has a high demand for Palmyrah jaggery, honey, toddy, and liquor. The Palmyrah Development Board is actively supporting the food industry by promoting various foods that can be prepared from palm trees grown without using any chemical fertilisers or poisons. Amaraweera suggested that more training should be provided for the palm-related food industry and the domestic appliance manufacturing industry. He also urged the Palmyrah Development Board to develop programmes that attract people to these industries. As part of the visit, the Minister presented recruitment letters to 30 trainees, who will be participating in training programmes conducted by the Palmyrah Development Board. BY Hansi Nanayakkara"

Speaking during the parliamentary debate on the joint proposal brought by the government and the opposition to remove the office bearers of SLC, Herath said, “The appointment of an Interim Committee is a positive move; however, doubts linger regarding the selection of its members. Specifically, the appointment of Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe’s son and a member from the Dharmadasa family raise questions about the transparency of the process. It appears that there may be ulterior motives at play, as indicated by the Sports Minister’s honest presentation. Further examination is warranted to uncover the truth behind these actions.” Herath said, the cricket governing body has been dominated by a few influential families. The succession of power has seen the Sumathipala family, followed by the Dharmadasa family and later the Ranatunga family. “However, it is worth questioning whether these families should be solely entrusted with the responsibility of leading. While Arjuna Ranatunga is undoubtedly a talented player, concerns arise about his suitability for administration,” he stressed. “The Cricket Board is plagued by the influence of money and politics, resulting in a detrimental impact on the game. While the cricket players strive to perform at their best, the board seems to be more focused on financial gains. This situation has raised concerns among the public, as the corrupt officials in cricket administration are causing the country to lose its deserved victories. Furthermore, the Cricket Board has evaded the scrutiny of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE).

Dharmathileke, who had been charged with failing to furnish requisite details sought as per the Right to Information (RTI) Act. The Magistrate deemed, that though the RTI Commission of Sri Lanka has the legal right to file a case of this nature, the case in question had been filed without the approval of the said Commission, as well as without its official seal and insisted as such, that there were no legal provisions to further maintain the case against the suspects. Magistrate Alwis also observed that despite his order, the RTI Commission of Sri Lanka could yet re-file the case, against the two suspects, under its official name and seal. A case had been filed before the said Court by Prof. Prashanthi Narangoda of the said University, following a complaint lodged by her, with the RTI Commission of Sri Lanka. Prof. Narangoda as per her complaint, had stated that details sought by her, as per the Provisions of the RTI Act, pertaining to an internal probe conducted by the University, into an alleged feud between two of its Professors, had not been furnished to her. President’s Counsel Sarath Jayamanne appearing for the respondents, and raising initial objections, stated that though only the RTI Commission has the authority to file a case of this nature, it had been filed solely by the Directer General of the said Commission and emphasised that the latter, has not been empowered by law, to act in such a manner. He further added that a case of this scale has to be filed always targeting institutions and not individuals. Counsel Jayamanne stressed that the charges filed against his clients, were unlawful and should be deemed null and void. This was also the first such case that had been filed as per the RTI Act, by the RTI Commission before the Court. BY Kumudu Upul Shantha"

Enlarging the suspect on bail, the Appellate Court Bench mentioned that it cannot allow either State Counsels or the Police to incarcerate suspects for years on end according to their ‘whims and fancies’. The Court pointed out that until such time, evidence is produced to substantiate the charges, no accused can be found guilty of an offense beforehand. The case was called before a two-Judge Bench of the Court of Appeal comprising of Justices Sampath Abeykoon and P. Kumararatnam. In its bail order, the Bench further added that if the fundamental rights accorded to citizens and enshrined in the country’s Constitution are to be taken away, then hard or foolproof evidence that is acceptable to the Court has to be submitted. The Court accordingly instructed the accused, identified as Dinuksha Fernando, alias ‘Chooti’, to be released on cash bail in Rs 100,000 and two sureties of two million rupees each. Lastly, the Court deemed it unfair to allow the accused to be further remanded when his lawyer had produced sufficient submissions to warrant his release on bail.

In a letter sent to the President’s Secretary yesterday (9), MCPA President Chamal Sanjeeva called for an inquiry into the conduct of the Health Secretary and other Ministry officials, not merely for the purpose of disciplinary action, but also to exonerate any officials who were innocent of misconduct. He said, recent media reports and media briefings had shed light on allegations, which had been levelled against the Health Secretary and several top officials of the Health Ministry. “These accusations have raised serious doubts about the conduct of key health sector officials, who are responsible for maintaining the integrity and transparency of our healthcare system,” he lamented. Dr. Sanjeeva said, Sri Lanka’s healthcare system which was regarded as one of the best in the region had remarkable achievements to its credit and had been able to successfully manage the first Covid-19 wave despite the limited resources that were available. “However, the recent alleged malpractices, mismanagement and corruption have tarnished the reputation of our healthcare system and eroded public trust,” he said noting that it had also demoralised the enthusiastic State healthcare workers in the island. Noting that the MCPA possessed credible evidence, he accused the Health Secretary and certain officials in the Ministry of undue influence on government tender procedures, malpractices and falsely framing charges against whistleblowers, prevention of disciplinary action against accused officials, misleading the Auditor General and violating the Human Rights of a Parliamentarian. “We urge you to follow the formal procedures outlined in the Establishment Code to address these allegations properly,” the MCPA President appealed.

In a statement, the BASL said impartial individuals should be appointed to investigate the truth of the allegations made against the Judge. “If the said purported allegations are proved to be true, it would undermine the integrity of the judicial system and if the said allegations are found to be baseless, the same would undermine the independence of the Judiciary and the integrity of the justice system in our country. Any allegation made against the judiciary if found to be untrue, the same would attract penal sanctions including Contempt of Court. The BASL ‘strongly’ call on the stakeholders to act within the provisions laid down in the Constitution and to protect the independence of the judiciary at any cost,” the statement said. The BASL said, the independence of the judiciary is a fundamental principle of the rule of law, noting that any form of undue interference with judicial independence is ‘extremely serious’ and would erode public confidence in the judiciary. “The statements being made in respect of ongoing Court cases and reference to Judges, purportedly taking cover behind parliamentary privileges, are seen as a direct threat to the independence of the judiciary. The legal fraternity has continuously raised serious concerns regarding this matter. The relevant MPs must be reminded that the right to represent a client is a professional right that has been safeguarded by law, and any threat to the right, is an attack on the profession at large,” the BASL said."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The Committee also tasked officials with developing and implementing mechanisms to collect these taxes or providing detailed explanations if they are unable to do so, along with proposing remedialactions to prevent such incidents in the future. The seriousness of the situation became evident when COPF obtained essential data related to sugar imports for the past three months from the Department of Customs. COPF questioned Ministry of Finance officials about the suspicious timing of this tax increase and the surge in sugarimports by certain companies just before the tax hike. In response, Ministry of Finance officials stated that the tax increase was part of the fiscal-basedrevenue consolidation programme linked to an IMF initiative. Furthermore, they highlighted that the sudden increase in sugar imports was a seasonal occurrence. In light of these claims, the Committee insisted on a comprehensive comparative analysis of previous years to verify these assertions. The Committee sounded the alarm about specific companies importing unusually large quantities of sugar without concrete evidence supporting the necessity for such massive imports. For example, a company that typically imported 2,000 MT of sugar monthly inexplicably imported 10,000 MT in October, just before the tax increase, reaping substantial gains as the tax jumped 200-fold from 25 cents to Rs 50. COPF Chairman Dr. Harsha de Silva stressed the importance of ending the use of ‘midnight gazettes’ related to special commodity levies. These practices provide the Minister of Finance with unchecked authority to change tax rates or grant tax exemptions to specific companies. This concern aligns with the recommendations made by the IMF in their Governance Diagnostic Report, urging Sri Lanka to eliminate ‘midnight gazettes’ due to their potential for fostering corruption."

Wickremaratne’s recommendations prioritise the optimisation of public assets, the establishment of a dedicated tax policy committee, and the creation of a centralised revenue collection authority. These proposals, if implemented, have the potential to rejuvenate Sri Lanka’s financial landscape. Foremost among Wickremaratne’s proposals is the transformation of public assets into lucrative income generators. The proposals focus on leveraging State-owned properties and resources to boost government revenue. By converting these assets into income streams, Sri Lanka can lay a solid foundation for sustainable economic growth. To ensure a well-structured and equitable tax framework, Wickremaratne called for the establishment of a Tax Policy Committee. “This dedicated body would be tasked with formulating and overseeing tax policies, ensuring they align with the nation’s economic objectives. A coordinated approach to tax policy is vital for providing clarity and predictability to businesses and investors.Sri Lanka’s tax collection system is set for transformation through the creation of a single, centralised revenue collection authority. This streamlined approach aims to reduce administrative complexities, enhance efficiency, and expedite revenue collection. By implementing this proposal, the Government can boost its fiscal stability and resource management,” he said. Wickremaratne highlighted that the significance of predictability in the tax regime, emphasising that it is often more important than the tax rate itself. This predictability allows businesses to plan effectively and allocate resources without unnecessary waste. The former Minister advocates for avoiding sudden tax changes, such as super gain taxes and surcharges, which can disrupt economic planning.He also addressed the need to reduce financial leakages, lower government expenditure and enhancing revenue collection. Additionally, he emphasises the importance of negotiating foreign currency debt restructuring to bring it to manageable levels. This shared responsibility will play a pivotal role in securing Sri Lanka’s economic future. Furthermore, he expressed concern about the excessive spending on defence and public services, highlighting that Sri Lanka’s defence expenditure exceeds 10 per cent, the highest in Asia. He proposes a reassessment and rationalisation of these expenditures, suggesting that the current ratio of public servants to ordinary citizens must be realigned to match global standards."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/11/09/us-partners-with-indias-adani-group/,US partners with India’s Adani Group,Author not found,0,2023-11-08T20:36:00+00:00," The strategic partnership between India and Sri Lanka has joined forces with the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which extended a USD 553 million loan to strengthen the collaboration between India’s Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) and John Keells Holdings, who have taken over the Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) for a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) operation. The agreement was signed yesterday (8) in Colombo with the arrival of CEO of the US’ DFC, Scott Nathan. In 2021, the Adani Group secured a 35-year Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) operation contract with a target investment of USD 700 million. Adani views the collaboration between India and the US as a strengthening force in their work on the CWIT. This strategic initiative is receiving substantial support from the US’s DFC, which specialises in partnering with the private sector to address strategic priorities in the developing world, said CEO of Adani Ports, Karan Adani. The involvement of the DFC in funding the Adani project is seen as a strong endorsement by the international community of their vision, capabilities and governance. Notably, this project represents the largest FDI for Sri Lanka through a single project he added. Upon completion, it is expected to have a transformative impact on the socioeconomic landscape not only in Colombo but across the entire island, significantly bolstering Sri Lanka’s trade, Adani added.   Foreign Minister Ali Sabry highlighted the significance of a deep-water container terminal and its critical infrastructure impact on the South Asian region. He said last year was economically challenging, but the country successfully secured an IMF deal within a 9-month period. However, he acknowledged that there are more challenges to be addressed and employment and investments are needed for growth. “In that context, the involvement of DFC and Adani, along with John Keells, in this monumental investment is a highly positive development with immense potential. It demonstrates our willingness to partner with everyone around the world, and we are committed to progress,” he said. DFC’s CEO, Nathan, who had visited the CWIT, emphasised that the CWIT represents a major investment and will play a vital role in providing critical infrastructure for the region. DFC’s financing will contribute to the transformation of Colombo into a world-class logistics hub, strategically positioned at the intersection of major shipping routes and emerging markets. DFC’s collaboration with private-sector partners is not only assisting the Sri Lankan people but also generating job opportunities. The Port of Colombo, the largest and busiest transshipment port in the Indian Ocean, has been operating at over 90% capacity since 2021, underscoring the need for additional capacity. The new terminal will cater to the growing economies in the Bay of Bengal, capitalising on Sri Lanka’s prime location on major shipping routes and its proximity to these expanding markets. CEO Nathan, prior to finalising the loan agreement for the Adani Group, was in Athens, Greece, where he signed a financing agreement for a USD 125 million loan for ONEX Elefsis Shipyards and Industries. CEO of CWIT Harikirishan Sundaram, pointed out that over the course of 18 months, they collaborated closely with DFC to develop a state-of-the-art facility at CWIT aimed at attracting transshipment traffic from the region, with a target of handling 3.2 millionTEUs annually for Sri Lanka at the Port of Colombo. India’s strategic partnership with Sri Lanka in the port business dates back to 2017 and Adani Group’s initial project agreement on the East Container Terminal (ECT) that was cancelled due to geopolitical challenges. In 2021, instead of the ECT, Adani was offered the CWIT. The CWIT was awarded on the basis that India’s largest port operator will hold a 51 per cent stake in the terminal and John Keels Holding will own 34 per cent. The remaining 15 per cent of the stake will be owned by Sri Lanka Ports Authority. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

In response to a question raised by Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) MP Vijitha Herath, the Premier said relevant departments and engineers are currently engaged in preliminary discussions to find a comprehensive solution to the water scarcity issue, in accordance with the country’s irrigation heritage. A similar project, known as the ‘River to Jaffna’, was initially proposed in 1954 by the late Engineer S. Arumugam. Construction began in the early 1960s but was interrupted in the late 1960s due to floods and was eventually abandoned due to the ethnic conflict that followed in the subsequent decades, he said. The Prime Minister added that due to the high capital cost associated with running sea water desalination plants, the government intends to focus on developing over 40,000 lakes and tanks across the country and harnessing rainwater as a viable alternative. He also said the Government was taking steps to safeguard areas susceptible to frequent flooding. When Herath queried the Government’s decision to seek the support of the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), an organisation accused of having an agenda to commodify water and water access, Gunawardena said Sri Lanka, being one of ten countries facing the highest climate risk, is dealing with adverse weather effects, including unexpected heavy rainfall and severe drought conditions. Therefore, he emphasised the importance of Sri Lanka collaborating with both local and international institutions and experts in the field to find solutions to mitigate these problems and exchange knowledge and expertise on climate change and water management.

Using the High-Density Cropping System introduced by the Ministry of Agriculture, H.M.A. Peiris (Bandula), a resident of Sivalakulama in Puliyankulama, Anuradhapura district, has achieved this remarkable income from chilli cultivation, Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera said. As part of the Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project under the Ministry of Agriculture, this farmer has successfully grown chilli on half an acre using the high-density cultivation method, resulting in an income of Rs 7 million. Traditionally, only about 6,000 chilli plants could be grown on half an acre, but with the high-density cultivation method, it’s possible to cultivate 13,000 plants, significantly increasing the yield. This new cultivation method minimises the use of fertiliser, water, insecticides, and herbicides. Additionally, there’s no need for extra expenses for weed control, thanks to the application of a polythene cover on the soil layer, preventing soil water evaporation. This system is advantageous for farmers in many ways. Previously, a farmer in Jaffna earned Rs five million from half an acre of chilli cultivation, breaking the record at the time. However, a young farmer from Anuradhapura surpassed this by earning Rs six million from the same land. Sivalakulama Bandula has now achieved the highest income record by earning Rs 7 million from half an acre of chilli cultivation in just six months. He has cultivated the latest chilli varieties, MICH-1 and MICH-2, introduced by the Mahailuppallama Agricultural Research Institute, which has significantly contributed to his high yield. In an interview with the farmer, he said he hadn’t completed his chilli harvest yet. He plans to harvest more chilli the next day, which is expected to be worth another Rs 1 million, bringing his total income from the half-acre to an impressive Rs 10 million. BY Hansi Nanayakkara"

Thassim, Assistant Governor of CBSL, Ajith Peiris, General Manager/ CEO, Senior Deputy General Manager, Deputy General Managers, Assistant General Managers, Regional Managers as well as other officers of NSB participated in the event. The National Savings Bank is an unparalleled savings institution with an inherited legacy of more than a century with the establishment of its precursor the Ceylon Savings Bank in 1832 and more than half a century of excellent performance in its present guise as the National Savings Bank (NSB). Since its inception in 1972, we have strived to become the nation’s premier savings institution dedicated to inculcating thrift amongst all citizens of this country. In achieving this noble goal, NSB has spared no efforts to enlighten the masses regardless of their social strata to ensure every individual embraces the savings habit and in turn ensures financial prudence. In celebration of World Thrift Day on 31 October, NSB has long pioneered the celebration of thrift and frugality throughout October and named it the Thrift Month in our corporate calendar. Since time immemorial the savings till has signified the accumulation of wealth through thrift and frugality. Both values are the guiding principles of the National Savings Bank and hence the till enshrined within the bank’s logo serves as the very symbol of its pride. Further, the till enables savings from the lowest monetary unit, thus enhancing its universal ability to appeal to anyone, as a simple tool to create a nest egg over time utilising even a cent as the bare minimum. This ability is unique in its appeal to people from the grassroots level to that of elite society to bring forth a sense of savings within them. Further, by design, the till once full provides the saver with a sense of satisfaction which in turn necessitates the saver to obtain a bigger till, this subtle sentiment leads the saver to invariably think big. The bigger one thinks the bigger one’s achievement. It is this sentiment that has driven the NSB to re-launch its most notable ‘NSB Mega Till’ Islandwide Savings Promotion in 2023 to coincide with its Thrift Month Programme. By re-launching the iconic NSB Mega Till Islandwide Savings Promotion, NSB envisions the parading of the symbolic till across the nation to raise awareness amongst the people and especially grant financial inclusion to those that are deemed unbanked and underbanked within the grassroots levels of society as well as appeal to the more well-off segments of society to embrace the savings culture. Given the prevailing economic situation of the country, NSB wishes to contribute to the nation’s improvement by increasing domestic savings across the board, leading to both microeconomic as well as macroeconomic benefits to the whole nation. As with any till, security is of great concern to the saver without which the purpose of a till may invariably be fulfilled by just any receptacle. Hence, the till gives the saver a sense of security where one can put in coins, but one cannot take it out unless the till is broken, which would be undesirable prior to the till being filled to the brim whence one obtains a larger till. To this end, NSB is proud to be named the Safest Bank in Sri Lanka with a 100 per cent Guarantee on the capital and interest thereon of all funds saved with the bank. This unmatched guarantee is a unique feature of NSB, one that no other banking or financial institution within Sri Lanka can match. With NSB, the saga of savings, whether it is an individual or the nation, is fulfilled."

A day after President Wickremesinghe thwarted Ranasinghe’s attempt to establish an Interim Cricket Board led by Arjuna Ranatunga, thereby dissolving the existing one and appointing a Cabinet Sub-Committee to oversee SLC operations, Ranasinghe launched a verbal attack on the President, accusing him of instructing him to disband the interim committee. Ranasinghe established the Interim Committee in the wake of a humiliating loss to India in the World Cup. He has been in an ongoing dispute with Sri Lanka Cricket, which is the most affluent sports organisation on the financially challenged island, for several months. During his address to Parliament, Ranasinghe stated that the President had also conveyed that if the Interim Committee was not disbanded, he would assume control of the Sports Ministry. Minister Ranasinghe disclosed that, in response, he had conveyed to the President his willingness to relinquish his ministerial role and allow him to make any decision he saw fit. “I made it clear to the President that I would never suspend the Interim Committee, given the staggering level of corruption within the SLC administration,” he asserted. The Sports Minister further asserted that the proposed Lanka T10 event, scheduled for December, was also tainted by corruption. He revealed that the decision to establish an interim committee for SLC was based on the recommendation stemming from the Auditor General’s report, which had exposed financial misconduct within the cricket administration. “It has been two months since the Auditor General’s report was submitted to the Inspector General of Police (IGP), yet no investigation has commenced. On the other hand, the Attorney General has requested me to establish another interim committee to initiate legal proceedings,” he disclosed in Parliament. The Sports Minister additionally announced his intention to deliver a comprehensive statement in Parliament tomorrow, addressing the current state of the SLC and related concerns. He made these remarks in response to inquiries raised by several opposition MPs, regarding the Court order issued on the same day (7), suspending the operations of the interim committee for SLC, that he had appointed, for 14 days, following a petition filed by SLC President Shammi Silva. Meanwhile, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), that is vocal about the injustices caused by recent income tax reforms to professionals, has requested clarification regarding a recent statement made by the Sports Minister, in which he claimed that the earnings of cricketers are now exempt from income tax. In a letter directed to the Income Tax Commissioner General, the GMOA referred to a document issued by Ranasinghe containing this statement. The GMOA noted that this document, issued on 3 November 2023, has been circulating on various social media platforms. They raised questions about whether such a policy change has been put into effect. Furthermore, the GMOA emphasised that any exemptions of this nature can only be enacted with the approval of Parliament or through an amendment to the Income Tax Act. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

Reports of missing paddy stocks from four Paddy Marketing Board warehouses in Polgahawela, Anamaduwa, Nikaweratiya and Maho prompted the investigation. These incidents had taken place from 2021-2022. The investigation revealed that 97,050 kg of paddy, valued at nearly Rs 100 million, had gone missing from these four warehouses. Amaraweera said yesterday (7) that action had been taken to interdict five officials implicated in the fraud. PMB Chairman, Buddhika Iddamalgoda, presented the investigation report to Minister Amaraweera. Three ongoing investigations include an internal audit inquiry, a preliminary investigation and involvement of the Criminal Investigation Department.

Siyambalapitiya said when the Government raised the special trade levy on sugar from 25 cents to Rs 50 there were no unusual developments in sugar imports. In response to questions raised by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa in Parliament, Siyambalapitiya said, “So far this year, the country has imported 546,488 MT of sugar. According to Customs records, sugar imports have decreased compared to the first five months of this year. On the day when this special trade tax was imposed, 35,000 MT of sugar had already been brought in, which was sufficient to meet consumer demands. The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) was established to enforce a maximum retail price for sugar and prevent unscrupulous traders from making unfair profits due to the special trade tax. This initiative is operating effectively. After the IRD’s special audit inquiry, the report will be presented in the House.” Meanwhile, the State Minister said five liquor manufacturing companies owed the Government Rs 2,715 million in tax arrears. He said with a three per cent fine imposed for delays, these companies were required to pay a total of Rs 6,721 million to the State. The licences of four of these companies were temporarily revoked due to their failure to pay tax arrears on time. One such company had initiated legal action against the Government, resulting in an extension of their licence until 13 November, which is the next hearing date. This company had been given time until 29 December to make the delayed tax payments, Siyambalapitiya added."

The minister has raised concerns as to how private individuals and business entities obtained information about the impending tax hike before it was formally presented to the Cabinet. He underscored that only officials from Sri Lanka Customs were privy to this tax adjustment. Addressing the media, Nanayakkara conveyed his determination to address any irregularities related to sugar taxation. He stated, “We voiced our concerns about sugar-related improprieties in the past, and we remain committed to doing so today. We will not remain silent in the face of fraud or mistakes, and we must ascertain what transpired in this situation.” He said, “The primary issue at hand is how this information regarding the tax increase reached business interests. Frankly, even Cabinet Members were unaware of the impending tax adjustment.” “When the government decides to impose a tax, certain businessmen promptly import related goods. Conversely, when tax reductions are in the offing, this same group hides such items. We must determine how this information reached these individuals,” he added. Nanayakkara asserted, “I am confident that such information did not leak from within the Cabinet.” Furthermore, Minister Nanayakkara alleged that there is a particular group that consistently profits from tax changes. He explained, “This is why the President established a maximum retail price for sugar. This decision prevents undue profits from the tax increase,” he added. He also said the Government has made some unpopular decisions in its pursuit of debt restructuring. “If we do not restructure our debt, our country will continue to face financial instability. Following the restructuring, Sri Lanka will attract investors, fostering business development and increasing people’s income. We will not allow any government institution to operate at a loss. All institutions should strive to be financially sustainable,” he said. Nanayakkara added, “As of today, interest rates have decreased, benefiting small businesses. Our goal is to elevate the income of our citizens, and I can confidently say that conditions will significantly improve by February or March next year.”"

This subsidy is in addition to a Rs 15,000 subsidy offered by the government for fertiliser purchases and compensation of Rs 100,000 per hectare. A meeting was held on Monday (6), under the leadership of Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industry, Mahinda Amaraweera, to discuss relief for the affected farmers. Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Agricultural Development, and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation were also present. During the last season, the Chinese Government generously provided 6.5 million litres of diesel free of charge for distribution to farmers in the country. However, two million litres remained unused as many small paddy farmers did not claim their fuel allocation. Therefore, Amaraweera decided to distribute this surplus fuel to farmers who were unable to carry out cultivation activities during the Maha season. He instructed the relevant officials to promptly distribute 40 litres of fuel to each affected farmer. This stock of diesel will be distributed to all affected farmers over the next two days. The minister also emphasised on giving priority to the farmers around the Udawalawa Reservoir, as their fields were left barren due to water scarcity. Many paddy fields were destroyed because water from Samanalawewa was not diverted to the Udawalawa reservoir in a timely manner. The Minister deemed the damage to the Walawa zone farmers a ‘Man Made Disaster’ and insisted on prioritising their relief efforts. “Today, farmers in the Walawa zone who suffered crop losses are struggling to meet their basic food needs. These farmers are crucial for the production of seed paddy in the country and the government recognises its responsibility to support them during this difficult time,” Amaraweera said.

The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

Varadaraja Perumal, former Chief Minister (CM) of the once-unified North-Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. In an interview with The Hindu after taking part in a book launch event in Coimbatore on Saturday, Perumal, who was CM for nearly one-and-a-half years from December 1988-March 1990 following the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987, said there had to be pressure from the Tamil parties and their leaders, “who are not acting [in this regard].” Recalling how Tamil rebel groups and parties were, during 1983-87, in frequent contact with Indian leaders, both in New Delhi and Tamil Nadu, the former leader of the Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) pointed out that a similar relationship did not exist now. “Merely sitting at a hotel in Jaffna and writing a letter to Prime Minister [Modi] would not work,” he observed.  Conceding that the Indian government too had a responsibility on the Tamil question even though it could not do what it did between 1983 and 1990, the 70-year-old former CM, who shuttles between India and Sri Lanka, said: “The Government of India cannot act in isolation. It needs the support of Indian people and leaders. There should be a voice within India for devolution and the political settlement [to be worked out in Sri Lanka]. This can be possible only if the Tamil leaders maintain close ties with leaders in New Delhi and Tamil Nadu. So, the primary responsibility lies with them.” At the same time, no room should be given for any “extreme or radical” move, Varadaraja Perumal hastened to add.  Emphasising that the 13th Amendment of Sri Lankan Constitution, dealing with devolution through elected bodies of Provincial Councils, should be “properly” implemented, he said if it was interpreted on the lines of similar features of the Indian Constitution in India, “this will take care of 70% to 75% of the political issues.”  Also, there was a need to “revisit the 13th Amendment” and the Indian government should constitute a team of legal experts to study the subject and convey [to Sri Lanka] how to ensure the “proper implementation” of the Amendment, against which the Sri Lankan government had never taken the stand per se.  “There are forces in several Sinhalese parties that favour devolution, besides NGOs and academicians,” he said, expressing the hope that with “consistent persuasion and perseverance,” progress could be achieved in the area of devolution. On measures to be taken for refugees from Sri Lanka living in Tamil Nadu, Varadaraja Perumal responded that the issue concerning the refugees had to be viewed humanely. While the demand for Indian citizenship could be considered last, there were “pressing issues” that required to be attended to first. The Indian government could, either individually or jointly with the Sri Lankan government, provide permanent documents to those who wanted to take up proper employment in India or abroad. Similarly, property acquisition rights could be given to the refugees for the purpose of housing. Restrictions on camp refugees’ visits to Sri Lanka could also be eased, he added.                                  (The Hindu)"

Informed sources yesterday (6) said the Secretary had allegedly issued a letter to the supplier, who is currently in custody, approving the collection of 2,000 litres of blood plasma from the National Blood Transfusion Centre (NBTC). The CID also has recorded a statement from the Director of the NBTC over the weekend. Meanwhile, informed health sources said that of the 55,000 litres of plasma that remained after separation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets only about 12,000 litres were used on patients while the remaining amount was supplied for commercial fractionation and was purchased by India on a tender basis for that purpose. The NBTC had received Cabinet approval for commercial fractionation in 2015. “We were disposing plasma of a superior quality and that was why the Cabinet too gave its approval. In addition, human plasma is provided for research purposes to universities and government institutions for research. Research proposals must be submitted and approved for this purpose, they said. However, it was in such an instance that the company, which is currently embroiled in the Immunoglobulin scam, approached the NBTC to obtain 2,000 litres of human plasma. They said however that the NBTC Director had been very cautious and therefore had requested a letter from higher authorities in the Health Ministry. The Health Ministry Secretary on 27 March 2023 had allegedly issued a letter to the supplier to obtain the 2,000 litres. The Director had applied further caution and appointed a five-member committee to review the project proposal which had been submitted by the individual requesting the 2,000 litres. They said that the committee had come up with an appropriate recommendation to issue plasma. It had recommended that 25 packs of 200 ml of human plasma be issued for a period of nine months. By September when the issue related to the Immunoglobulin scam had cropped up the NBTC had only issued 150 litres of the plasma. President Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association of Doctors (MCPA), Chamal Sanjeeva explaining said that the plasma had been obtained from the NBTC on the pretext of carrying out research to identify undiscovered plasma protein. However, Sri Lanka, he said, did not possess the technology in any sphere to carry out such research. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Addressing a gathering of Sri Lankan expatriates in New York, USA, Dissanayake expressed concerns over the government’s postponement of the Local Government and Provincial Council elections. He emphasised that the Constitution clearly dictates that the executive power of the people should be exercised by a President chosen by the citizens. “While it is possible to manage Local Government bodies through Commissioners and Provincial Councils through Governors, the essential executive power vested in the President, elected by the people, must be upheld. Therefore, it is imperative that the Presidential election takes place before 17 October next year. If the President attempts to evade the election, he may have to step down even before 17 October. Some inquire why people don’t take to the streets despite enduring significant hardships. People are patiently waiting for the Presidential election, but they will mobilise for protests if they sense that the election is being postponed,” he stressed. Dissanayake further highlighted that the JJB encompasses a coalition of various forces committed to transforming the country once they gain power. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

This was revealed yesterday (6) by Engineer S. P. C. Sugershwara, the Irrigation Director responsible for Hydrology and Disaster Management at the Department of Irrigation. Eng. Sugershwara noted that with the rising water levels of Nilwala Ganga, low-lying areas along the river could be inundated. Mini floods have already been reported in Thalgahagoda and Thawalama areas situated within the Nilwala Ganga river basin. A similar situation has been reported in the Morawaka area, which falls under the Walawe Ganga. Residents in low-lying areas and those living in the Nilwala Ganga basin have been advised to follow the precautionary guidelines issued by the Department, exercise caution, stay vigilant, and be prepared to relocate to safe areas if the river’s water level increases, according to Eng. Sugershwara. The Department of Irrigation has opened the spill gates of the Rajanganaya and Deduru-oya reservoirs and nine spill gates of the Thabbowa reservoir. Furthermore, five spill gates of the Deduru Oya Reservoir have been opened, releasing 13,800 cubic feet of water into the Deduru-oya. As the water level of Deduru-Oya rises, residents in low-lying areas are urged to remain vigilant and relocate to safe places if the situation worsens. Additionally, Sugershwara said that the water level of Attanagalu-oya continues to rise, leading to a mini flood in the Moragaswewa area, which is in the low-lying region of Deduru-Oya. The Department of Meteorology, on the same day, predicted that the adverse weather conditions are expected to persist for the next few days. Duty Meteorologist Buddika Banduratne explained that heavy showers exceeding 100 mm are expected in some areas of the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, and Uva Provinces, as well as the Galle and Matara Districts. Banduratne also forecasted morning showers in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, along with misty conditions in the morning for the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, and Uva Provinces. Duty Meteorologist Banduratne cautioned the public about the possibility of temporary strong gusty winds and lightning strikes during the thundershowers. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

This allocation covers both capital and recurring expenses related to education in the nine provinces. The Cabinet has already approved a policy framework for education reforms, which will be presented in Parliament after receiving sectoral parliamentary approval. The goal of this initiative is to establish a stable and enduring education policy that transcends different governments and ministers. It focuses on four key areas, aiming to shift from an exam-centric system to a more diverse and inclusive classroom assessment approach, ultimately providing quality education for both students and educators. The Minister highlighted that the upcoming academic year will commence on 19 February 2024, marking the start of the first school term. He stressed that the curriculum spanning from the first to the eleventh year will be completed within the same academic year. Speaking at a press conference, held at the President’s Media Centre (PMC) Premajayantha shared further details: “Due to certain delays in the country, the school year began on 27 March 2023. Measures have been taken to prevent such delays, ensuring the start of the new school term on 19 February 2024. Our objective is to complete the curriculum from the first year to the eleventh year within the same academic year, allowing us to conduct the 2025 school year without interruptions. “We have also made arrangements to conduct Advanced-Level Examinations. Despite some professional challenges, we have maintained the examination schedules, ensuring timely examinations. We are prepared to release the results of the Ordinary Level Examinations conducted in the third week of this month. Despite ongoing circumstances, we are determined to manage time efficiently and conduct exams as scheduled. “When we assumed office, there were 808 vacant positions. The Treasury approved the recruitment of 50 per cent of these vacancies. As the examinations have been completed, we are actively preparing for interviews and recruitment. Furthermore, approval has been granted for 707 teacher education service positions and we are working towards their immediate appointment. This move aims to provide training for teachers across 19 faculties. Our goal is to fill all teaching service vacancies before the upcoming school term.” The Minister also addressed the challenges faced in the appointment of teachers and development officers as graduates, explaining that provincial-level vacancies for retired dignitaries and teachers who have left service are being approved and recruitment is in progress. In an effort to strengthen education in specific subjects, the Treasury has approved the recruitment of 5,450 personnel for science, mathematics, English, foreign languages, and technology subjects. These recruitments are taking place at the provincial level, with a Gazette Notification for national schools scheduled for release this week. Minister Premajayantha also revealed plans for textbook distribution, school uniforms and meal provisions. Textbook preparations and distribution for the year 2024 are complete, with 80% of school uniform work finalised. The government is planning to provide meals to all school students starting next year, with the goal of offering lunch to every school child by 2030. Various programmes, in collaboration with the World Food Programme, USAID, and the private sector, are underway to achieve this goal. In conclusion, the Minister emphasised the government’s commitment to providing professional training in skills and technology to students after General and Advanced Level examinations. Selected schools will offer evening classes over a four-month period, focusing on guidance, English, information technology, and various other courses tailored to students’ preferences."

Despite more than 150 shops operating day and night at the economic centre, the rear areas of the shops and restaurants are in a deplorable, unsanitary condition, primarily due to a lack of attention from any responsible authority. Traders also highlight the presence of large potholes at every entrance to the Dambulla Economic Centre, causing severe traffic disruptions. They are dissatisfied with the maintenance of the centre, which seems to prioritise profit over cleanliness. The Dambulla Economic Centre distributes around seventy per cent of Sri Lanka’s vegetable needs within a single night, receiving vegetables and fruits from all corners of the island. During our site visit to inspect the storage conditions, we observed extreme levels of pollution behind the shops. The storage areas were contaminated with faeces, phlegm, betel spit, and various other impurities. The drainage systems were poorly maintained, with visible signs of worm infestation. Shockingly, vegetables from farmers were stored on top of these unsanitary conditions. Additionally, green vegetables such as curry leaves, rampe leaves and other produce were placed on top of spit. Store owners claim that their employees are responsible for this unsanitary practice but refuse to take responsibility to stop it. In the main canteen of the Dambulla Economic Centre and other canteens, both the cooking and food serving areas were found to be unclean. Cooked food, as well as meat and fish stored in refrigerators, were kept together and served to customers. Restaurant owners were unwilling to allow inspections of these areas. When we spoke with the former president of the Dambulla Economic Centre trade association, U. B. Ekanayake, he acknowledged that the inside of the economic centre is indeed highly polluted and not as it used to be. The Dambulla Economic Centre is managed by a trust. The manager Christy Wijeratne, mentioned that it is challenging to properly oversee all activities within the centre. However, he did not provide a clear response when asked about the potential distribution of diseases and pathogens nationwide, related to the presence of faeces, urine, betel saliva, and waste vegetable and fruit deposits. He claimed to have raised awareness about the issue. BY K.K. Ariyadasa – Dambulla"

During a discussion at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute last week, Sarojanie Jayasekara, Director of the Solid Waste Management Division at CEA said the CEA held several rounds of discussions on banning the polythene wrap in question with corporate sector. “Many companies agreed not to use the polythene wrap. But some of them do keep to the agreement. As a result, laws will be introduced to completely ban the polythene wrap on the water bottle caps soon,” she said. Jayasekara, reporting a concerning disparity in the handling of plastic waste in Sri Lanka, said despite the daily collection of approximately 930 MT of plastic waste in the country, only 50 MT are effectively recycled. Although a national action plan has been formulated to address plastic waste, the authorities emphasise that the nation continues to grapple with mounting garbage issues, including plastic pollution that is adversely affecting the environment. This discussion was convened by the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) to address Sri Lanka’s commitment to a global plastic pollution treaty and involved various stakeholders, including the CEA, Ministry of Environment, Sri Lanka Customs, Ministry of Industry and the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), among others. Jayasekara highlighted the critical issue of inadequate plastic recycling. She said about 300 MT of plastic waste is collected by the local authorities and 600 MT of plastic waste find their way into the environment daily due to insufficient recycling efforts. Moreover, only 56 organisations have secured licences for plastic recycling activities in the country. Additionally, the Aruwakkalu waste recycling centre is currently non-operational but is expected to become operational next year, she added. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/11/06/minister-alles-urges-police-to-act-without-fear/,Minister Alles urges Police to act without fear,Author not found,0,2023-11-05T20:35:00+00:00," Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles, expressing his firm stance on combating the underworld and drug-related issues within the law enforcement sector, said officers who are unable to effectively address these concerns will no longer be placed in such critical roles. Instead, he insisted that officers who can diligently perform their duties should be appointed. Minister Alles urged all officers to take resolute action against criminals without fear and assured them of his unwavering support during his tenure in as the Minister of Public Security. He stressed that the station commander of each Police station holds responsibility for handling matters related to drugs, the underworld, and other aspects within their respective areas across the island. Officers who are unable to fulfil these crucial responsibilities will be transferred from their current stations. Minister Alles made these statements while participating in an an event held in Unawatuna, Galle on Friday (3), with the participation of the Officers-in-Charge (OICs) of Police stations in the Southern Province and several other officials. He mentioned that he has gathered reports from the intelligence divisions detailing the occurrences within each Police jurisdiction. Based on these reports, necessary actions will be taken to address the situation effectively. “First and foremost, I must emphasise that since I assumed this ministry, I have made every effort to support our Police officers. However, I have consistently stressed that in return for my efforts, I expect all of you to carry out your duties effectively. Regrettably, the results have not met my expectations. For example, in the Southern Province, we issued clear instructions regarding the placement of roadblocks. To verify whether these measures were being implemented as instructed, we had two individuals, wearing full-face helmets and jackets, ride a motorcycle through the roadblock at Galduwa Junction multiple times. Unfortunately, none of the Police officers deployed at the roadblock noticed this particular motorcycle passing through in a suspicious manner multiple times,” the Minister stressed. “This situation clearly demonstrates that the duties at the roadblocks are not being carried out effectively. The Officers-in-Charge, Deputy Inspectors General (DIGs) and all responsible authorities must bear accountability for this failure. It is imperative that top officials closely monitor these operations. When they neglect their oversight responsibilities, it can lead to a lax attitude among lower-ranked officials. Despite our efforts to establish numerous roadblocks, the current situation reflects a significant gap in implementation. I had discussions with the Inspector General of Police, who also informed me that he had issued explicit instructions regarding the routes to be followed after a shooting incident. Unfortunately, these instructions have not been adhered to. Both the OICs and the DIGs must be held responsible for this failure. It is essential to address these issues promptly and ensure that our security measures are being executed effectively. “Moving forward, it is imperative that the Officers-in-Charge take full responsibility for such failures. While the Special Task Force (STF) is assigned specific tasks, we should not solely rely on the STF to handle all aspects of law enforcement. In the event of a shooting incident within any Police Division, the OIC should assume responsibility. We expect to be promptly informed about the circumstances surrounding the shooting, including how it transpired, whether a roadblock was in place in the vicinity and why the assailants could not be intercepted at the roadblock. Officials must be prepared to provide satisfactory answers to these inquiries. This approach extends to other criminal activities such as narcotics and underworld operations. In cases where OICs are unable to provide adequate explanations for such incidents, they will be subject to transfer. It is essential that we establish a system of accountability to enhance the effectiveness of our law enforcement efforts. “I’m sharing this information now so that you can plan your work accordingly. I will gather intelligence reports to assess your performance and based on that, I will make decisions regarding your positions. If there are ineffective officials in your Police stations, kindly inform the higher authorities and after due process, remove them. Submit a report to the division and ensure the DIG is informed. The current situation is regrettable. It’s unacceptable that underworld figures can contact and threaten Police officers. Isn’t there a sense of shame? These underworld figures are our adversaries and it’s our duty to eradicate them from our society for the sake of our children. Keep in mind that it’s your responsibility to do everything within your means to eliminate these underworld figures from the Southern Province. If you do so, I will always support your efforts. Arrest them, and if they attack you, respond firmly. You have my full backing.” “I have to say that I did not have a chance to rest for two days when we were bringing ‘Harak Kata’ and ‘Salindu’ back to our country. As soon as I became aware of the situation, I engaged in frequent telephone conversations with the Minister of Public Security of Madagascar, at all hours of the day. During the transition from there to ‘Harak Kata’s and Salindu’s arrival on the plane, I maintained constant communication with our CID officers. When the duo was moved to Kenya, there was an issue with the coordination and a communication gap led to a missed handing over of the criminals. Subsequently, I had to liaise with Indian authorities to ensure a smooth transit. Afterward, the situation was rectified, and the operation proceeded. There were some challenges even during the journey Despite these challenges, by working collaboratively, we can successfully address such issues. It’s worth noting that significant financial resources are involved in these operations. Both I and the higher-ranking officials are aware of this fact. I would like to share that, during Harak Kata’s return to Sri Lanka, there was an attempt to offer me Rs 700 million to divert the operation to Dubai instead of Sri Lanka. The President is also aware of this matter. Nevertheless, we must remain resolute and not succumb to such offers. It is noteworthy that the individual who made this offer was killed in the Southern Province. Furthermore, there are ongoing attempts by certain individuals to offer large sums of money to higher-ranking officials in exchange for my removal from this ministry. Harak Kata’s wife has conveyed the message that the Harak Kata’s detention order can be cancelled  if not for Minister Tiran Alles. I am aware that some OICs, whom I won’t name, are engaging in phone conversations with individuals associated with the underworld. I strongly urge them to sever such connections immediately. Following this statement, there will be no leniency shown towards officials involved in such corrupt activities.” By Mithun Jayawardhana"

In a statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said the Consular Affairs Division of the ministry coordinated their return in collaboration with the Sri Lankan Missions in Cairo, Ramallah, and Tel Aviv. Foreign Ministry officials welcomed the returning Sri Lankan nationals on their arrival at BIA. The entry of these 11 Sri Lankans from the Gaza Strip into Egypt via the Rafah Border Crossing was facilitated by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Cairo, in coordination with Egyptian authorities on 2 November. The Embassy officials were present at the Rafah Border to receive the stranded Sri Lankans, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs managed the logistics and air transportation arrangements for their return with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). On 2 November, a group of 17 Sri Lankans who were trapped in the Gaza Strip during the Israel-Hamas conflict were allowed to leave the war-torn Palestinian enclave and enter Egypt through the Rafah Border Crossing, according to communication from the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Tel Aviv. However, 15 of these Sri Lankans were expected to reach Egypt, while the remaining two were likely to stay behind in Palestine, according to the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLBFE). Nonetheless, 13 of the 17 Sri Lankans permitted to leave Gaza were in an area between the entrance to the Rafah Border Crossing and Egypt, as the other four individuals were unable to depart Palestine due to security concerns. Subsequently, on 3 November, the Representative Office of Sri Lanka in Palestine announced that a group of 11 Sri Lankans had successfully reached Egypt after crossing the Rafah border, and preparations were underway to facilitate their repatriation.

The Minister said a survey conducted by the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agricultural Research and Training Institute (HARTI) showed that crop damage caused by wild animals would cost the country between Rs 17-20 billion annually. Toque monkeys are the main culprits behind crop damage. Additionally, crop damage caused by peacocks, porcupines, wild boar and giant squirrels has been on the rise. All previous strategies to prevent crop damage by wild animals have proved unsuccessful. The country loses over 31,000 MT of vegetables and fruit annually due to damage by wildlife.

With the assistance of Galkiriyagama Wildlife Range Officers and Wildlife Department Officials, the skull and tusks were carefully exhumed from their resting place within the grounds of the Galkiriyagama Wildlife Range Office. The Wildlife Department has announced that after necessary preservation efforts, the tusks will be reattached to the skull and subsequently put on display for the public. Local residents have been vocal in their concerns, blaming influential individuals for their mistreatment of the flora and fauna in the area, which they believe has led to the tragic loss of many elephants within the park. They express a genuine apprehension about the dwindling elephant population and its irreversible impact on their way of life. Ven. Wanawasi Rahula Thera, in discussions with the media, criticised the successive governments’ failure to devise a comprehensive solution to the human-elephant conflict, which, for decades, has resulted in the loss of numerous iconic elephants in the region. He emphasised the need for government officials to be more attentive to this pressing issue, as these elephants play a crucial role in generating revenue for the state through tourism. Last year, three individuals were arrested on suspicion of setting up illegal electric fences, which are believed to have contributed to the untimely demise of Barana.

Such institutions that have failed to disclose essential information will be summoned before the Commission in the near future, Chairman of RTI Commission retired Supreme Court Justice Upali Abeyratne said. In situations where State institutions have not given information that should be proactively disclosed, citizens typically resort to the RTI Act to request such information. However, prompt action will now be taken against State institutions that do not provide the requested information, the Chairman said. Further, it has come to light that certain State institutions have failed to disclose critical information for many years, despite requests to make this information available to the public. In many cases, government websites lack the necessary facilities for public access, he pointed out. These concerns were raised during an appeal for information requested on behalf of 400 families affected by the construction of the final stretch of Central Expressway that has allegedly violated environmental assessments. The Chairman also pointed out that a substantial number of State institutions have not disclosed vital information to the public for an extended period, and legal action has so far not been instituted against such institutions.

The Department of Excise announced yesterday that these companies collectively owe a total of Rs 6 billion in unpaid taxes to the Government. The affected distilleries include Wayamba Distilleries (Pvt.) Ltd, Mendis Distilleries, Randenigala Distilleries (Pvt.) Ltd, Finland Distilleries (Pvt.) Ltd, and Synergy Distilleries (Pvt.) Ltd. The owners of these distilleries have neglected to pay their excise duties for an extended period, causing a significant impact on the Government’s revenue collection. Excise Duty is a primary source of income for the State. According to the Excise Department, the annual licences for these companies, with outstanding arrears, had expired on 31 October and were not renewed. Consequently, the production and distribution of their alcohol products have been halted. As some of these companies have not paid taxes for an extended period, the department granted them a deadline to clear the outstanding dues. However, only a few managed to meet this deadline, with one company obtaining a 40-day Stay Order against the decision. This issue came to light during a recent meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA). State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, the COPA Chairman, instructed the Commissioner General of the Excise to suspend the licences of any distillery that had not settled their excise tax arrears by 31 October. Some of the distilleries that failed to pay their excise taxes have also been blacklisted for distributing adulterated liquor with counterfeit stickers. The Commissioner General of Excise revealed this information during a COPA meeting. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/11/03/president-acknowledges-vat-increase-decision-challenging/,President acknowledges VAT increase decision challenging,Author not found,0,2023-11-02T20:33:00+00:00,"President Ranil Wickremesinghe acknowledged that the decision to increase VAT by 18 per cent was a challenging one, driven by the need to maintain economic stability. President Wickremesinghe highlighted that true leadership involves being honest with the people and making decisions that benefit the nation. During his address at the National Industry Excellence Awards 2023, which took place on Wednesday (1), at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre in Colombo, Wickremesinghe also announced his intention to address bank loan concessions for small and medium-scale industrialists in the upcoming budget, aiming to strengthen Sri Lanka’s export-oriented manufacturing economy. He expressed confidence in the youth leadership within the government and the group of young ministers dedicated to working for the country. President Wickremesinghe pledged to collaborate with them to improve the country’s economic situation by 2024. The National Industry Excellence Awards 2023, jointly organised by the Ministry of Industry and the Ceylon Industrial Development Board, is a step towards achieving this goal. In this context, 300 successful entrepreneurs were recognised and awarded in various categories, including Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze awards, out of a pool of over 4,000 industrial entrepreneurs who had applied to compete in 21 major industrial sectors and 61 sub-industrial sectors. Expressing his views further President Ranil Wickremesinghe said: “As I observed the award recipients today, it brought back memories of the challenges we faced last year. At that time, there were numerous uncertainties about the sustainability of our industries. The absence of electricity and the difficulty in obtaining bank loans had led to the closure of thousands of businesses. Today, it’s truly remarkable to see a substantial number of individuals reinvigorating their industries and achieving success. Small and medium-scale industries have made a swift comeback in a relatively short period. However, some issues remain unresolved, particularly concerning bank loans and market access. Our foremost priority is to address these concerns. In the upcoming budget, we aim to introduce measures that provide bank loan concessions to support small and medium-scale industries. This programme is progressing steadily. We have devised comprehensive strategies to revitalise our nation’s economy, engaging in discussions with both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and our creditors. Our primary focus always revolves around our capacity to repay the loans we’ve taken. To achieve this, we must consistently increase our income year after year. Gaining the trust of private creditors and multilateral creditors is imperative to reassure them of our commitment to loan repayment. This commitment must be ingrained in our actions. A substantial portion of next year’s budget will be allocated to debt repayment and interest. Failure to meet these obligations could push us back into the old, precarious situation. Therefore, safeguarding our currency and fulfilling our loan obligations is of paramount importance. In the past, when there was a budget shortfall, the solution was to instruct the central bank to print more money. However, this approach is no longer legally permissible and obtaining loans from banks has also become a challenge. These restrictions stem from the informal financial practices of the past. To ensure our financial stability in the coming year, we must significantly boost our income. We have set specific revenue targets that we must work diligently to achieve. It’s crucial for the country’s progress and to prevent bankruptcy in the near future. As a result of these financial constraints, we had to make the difficult decision to raise the VAT to 18%. This step aligns us with the practices of countries like India and Pakistan. Such decisions are never easy for any government. However, failing to take these measures would cast a shadow on everyone’s future. Therefore, making the right choices becomes imperative. These decisions are necessary for the well-being of the country, even if they draw criticism from the public. Both my Cabinet and I have willingly shouldered the responsibility of rebuilding our nation, which had faced economic collapse. We made a deliberate choice not to revert to a state of dependency. Instead, we are committed to moving forward with our own strengths. Regrettably, during a Cabinet meeting held last Sunday evening, we had to make this tough decision. While some may point fingers, failing to act would risk returning to the dire circumstances of the previous year. At the start of this year, our economic growth rate was a negative 0.7%. Today, it has improved to 0.5%, with further progress expected next year. This leaves us with a fundamental choice of whether to advance or regress. This is the essence of leadership – the willingness to make difficult decisions and transparently convey the true state of affairs to the people. Through this decision, we can generate much-needed revenue to support small and medium-scale industries by repaying loans to banks. Without this step, these industries would face collapse, which puts industrialists in a challenging position. Thus, these difficult decisions must be made for the betterment of the country, even if they invite criticism. Our focus should remain on the nation’s well-being.”"

He also announced the formation of a committee, led by the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, where three key proposals were discussed. Finance Minister of India, Nirmala Sitharaman was the Guest of Honour at the ‘Naam 200’. At the event, Sitharaman, along with President Wickremesinghe, virtually launched phase – 4 of the flagship Indian Housing Project, for the construction of 10,000 houses in plantation areas of Sri Lanka. She spoke on the history of the South Indians’ journey to the island country 200 years ago and thanked them for their service to the country they made their home. She said the Prime Minister of India has been overwhelmingly supporting the Indian origin Tamils of Sri Lanka and has pledged support with grants to uplift the lives of this community. They also virtually inaugurated the upgraded Thondaman Vocational Training Center, built with Government of India grant assistance. The President acknowledged that there are upcountry Tamils, who are no longer engaged in plantation work and expressed empathy for their issues, understanding the challenges they face. He reminisced about his own days as a member of a trade union, alongside the late Savumiamoorthy Thondaman, who represented the Ceylon Workers’ Congress (CWC). The President revealed a plan to transit plantation workers into out-growers, allowing them to supply tea to factories and own portions of tea estates, similar to small and medium-scale tea plantations in the South. “Regional plantation companies will be asked to outsource tea plucking to workers, which will eliminate the existing plantation system, transforming them into tea smallholders with ownership of the land,” added the President. Addressing housing issues, he noted that upcountry Tamils do not have plots of land and committed to providing 10 perches of land to each family and issuing land deeds. Additionally, he emphasised the importance of improving education, promising to explore Jeevan Thondaman’s educational proposals and striving for equal education opportunities for the upcountry Tamil community. The President expressed that these proposals would be implemented and he had gained the support of many plantation political representatives, as well as the Prime Minister, to advance these initiatives. President Wickremesinghe acknowledged India’s contribution by welcoming 10,000 people from the upcountry Tamil community.Minister Jeevan Thondaman emphasised that the upcountry Indian community is equal to any other community in the country. He acknowledged the challenges they had overcome and called for an end to the unchanged life of the past 200 years, urging complete change and recognition of the upcountry Indian origin Tamil community. Jeevan Thondaman stressed the need for economic and social progress, inviting everyone to join forces to uplift the Indian origin community. He said the 115, 000 workers are at the plantation and there is 1.3 million Indian origin Tamils in the country but the 115,000 workers identity has been the identity of the entire community and that has to change. The economic progress is only possible when there is a social progress, noted the Minister.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

She made this revelation during a recent media briefing. Addressing the same media briefing Dr. Chithramalee de Silva, the Director of Maternal and Child Health of FHB, addressed the issue of wasting and obesity among school children, linking it to the ongoing economic crisis and financial constraints on families. In response to a question posed by Ceylon Today, Dr. Chitramalee explained that the high cost of living has made it difficult for people to access nutritious food. As a result, parents have resorted to providing cheaper, but less nutritious, food options that are high in sugar and fats.  Their primary focus has become merely “filling up the stomachs” of their children, as they are unable to prioritise nutrition given the current financial situation. Dr. Chitramalee also mentioned that various studies Conducted by several State Universities have identified an increase in diabetes among school children in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, Dr. Lokubalasuriya also noted an increase in children aged 12 to 13 dropping out of schools. Referring to a survey report, she stated that the attendance of male children in Colombo schools has declined due to them leaving school to engage in menial jobs.  Parents have been encouraging their children to do so due to economic constraints on their families. She mentioned that during her visits to Kurunegala and Batticaloa, even principals and teachers in these districts expressed concerns about declining student attendance records, as parents struggle to afford transportation for their children between home and school.

These residents said they have not received compensation for their damaged houses, which resulted from violations of environmental assessment reports during the construction of the Central Expressway. In an attempt to obtain related documents under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, the affected local residents submitted over 400 Right to Information (RTI) requests on 22 October. They sent 200 requests each to both the Road Development Authority (RDA) and the relevant contractor company,. Their goal was to request information, including damage assessment reports for their houses and associated financial assessments, to be provided within 48 hours. According to Section 25(3) of the Right to Information Act, organisations must respond within 48 hours to requests related to citizens’ lives or personal freedom. The RTI requests sent to the RDA contained 18 questions, while those sent to the contractor company contain 16 questions. The Association of Victimised Families, from the construction of the Central Expressway, stated that more than 400 houses were damaged during the construction of the Central Expressway, specifically the final segment from Mirigama to Kurunegala. Some victims have not received compensation, while others have received inadequate compensation, as low as Rs 5,000 or 10,000 for seriously damaged houses. Despite continuous complaints to the RDA, the Police, and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), the residents’ concerns have gone unaddressed. In response to this, the people submitted the 400 RTI requests under the Right to Information Act. As the RDA and other institutions failed to provide requested information, an appeal hearing, related to one RTI request submitted by Sanjeewa Kulathilaka, took place yesterday (2) at the RTI Commission, Colombo. Attorney-at-Law Manushika Cooray represented the information requesters and nearly 40 civil society activists, local residents and journalists were present at the hearing.  Although the human rights activists and journalists requested that the appeal hearing be recorded or broadcast live through the website, the commission refused to do so. However, except for two journalists, all others were allowed to attend the appeal hearing. During the hearing, the RDA claimed that they had not received the RTI request, but it was revealed that they had indeed received it. The RDA also stated that they do not possess some of the requested information. At this point, the information requester Sanjeewa Kulathilaka and journalist Tharindu Jayawardhana made a lengthy statement, explaining that the RTI Act itself requires the disclosure of some categories of information, even before filing requests. They stressed, “We explained with facts that the Minister of Transport and Highways has fulfilled the legal responsibility assigned under the RTI Act. On the other hand, the RTI Commission too has not fulfilled its responsibility under Section 14 (a) of the RTI Act. At this juncture, Upali Abeyratne, the chairman of the Commission, claimed that things were always slow like that for many years and it is difficult to change such things. In response to this, the local residents protested, leaving the commission and staging a peaceful demonstration. Finally, the commission ordered the RDA to provide the requested information within 10 days. No decision was reached on other RTI requests, and further hearing was scheduled on 15 November.

These respondents, namely former President Maithripala Sirisena, former Defence Ministry Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara, and former Chief of the State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena, have been directed to provide information about their financial status. The Supreme Court’s decision stems from the fact that these four respondents failed to fulfil their obligation to pay the full compensation as ordered by the Court. Additionally, the court has called for a detailed report from the Attorney General regarding the disciplinary actions taken against the former SIS chief, Jayawardena, by 30 December 2023. On 12 January 2023, the Supreme Court found these individuals, along with former National Intelligence Chief Sisira Mendis, responsible for violating the fundamental rights of the public due to their failure to take preventive action against the Easter Sunday bombings, despite having received adequate intelligence information. The Court, in its judgment, ordered Sirisena to pay Rs 100 million in compensation to the petitioners from his personal funds, while Pujith Jayasundara and Nilantha Jayawardena were each instructed to pay Rs 75 million. Hemasiri Fernando and Sisira Mendis were required to pay Rs. 50 million and Rs 10 million, respectively. This ruling was issued by a seven-member bench of Supreme Court Judges in response to the 12 petitions filed by various parties who claimed that their fundamental rights were violated due to negligence and failure to prevent the coordinated terrorist attacks on 21 April 2019. In July 2023, it was reported that the former president had made an initial payment of Rs. 15 million ahead of the deadline, while Hemasiri Fernando, Pujith Jayasundara, and Sisira Mendis had paid Rs 1 million, Rs 1,725,588, and Rs 5 million, respectively. Sirisena had also submitted a motion requesting permission to pay the remaining amount in 10 installments of Rs. 8.5 million each, running from 30 June 2024, to 20 June 2033. In this motion, filed through his legal representatives, Sirisena explained that he receives a pension of Rs. 97,500 as the former President, in addition to a sum of Rs. 54,285 for his services as an MP. Therefore, he sought a 9-year period to settle the outstanding sum of the Rs 100 million. BY Kumudu Upul Shantha"

The theme for this year’s GMC was ‘Maritime Security in the Indian Ocean Region: Converting Common Maritime Priorities into Collaborative Mitigating Frameworks’. The fourth edition of the Goa Maritime Conclave was attended by Chiefs of Navies and Heads of Maritime Forces from 12 Indian Ocean Region countries including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Comoros, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Myanmar, Seychelles, Singapore and Thailand. Meanwhile, the Keynote address of the conclave was delivered by Defence Minister of India, Rajnath Singh and Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture, Meenakshi Lekhi. The conference offered a valuable platform for stakeholders to share ideas and work together to address a wide range of unlawful activities, including non-traditional maritime issues, in the Indian Ocean Region. Meanwhile, Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera addressed the conference on the topic of ‘Maritime Security in the Indian Ocean Region: Converting Common Maritime Priorities into Collaborative Mitigating Frameworks – A Sri Lanka’s Perspective’. In the address, he emphasised the multifaceted challenges confronting the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), calling for unwavering vigilance and collaborative efforts. Pointing to the intricate web of threats, he underscored the rising presence of non-state actors, transnational criminal organisations, and territorial disputes. Shedding light on the concerning surge in the illicit arms trade and drug trafficking, the Commander highlighted the daunting task of policing the expansive ocean. Moreover, he articulated the profound impact of climate-induced changes on island states, triggering internal and external displacements of coastal communities. Notably, the Commander highlighted Sri Lanka’s commitment to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and advocated the collaborative, multilateral approach of the Sri Lanka Navy. He also acknowledged the successes achieved in fostering partnerships with both regional and extra-regional navies, particularly through conferences such as the Goa Maritime Conclave as well as the Galle Dialogue, hosted by the Sri Lanka Navy. Meanwhile, the Navy Commander also expressed his gratitude to the Chief of the Naval Staff India for extending an invitation to address this year’s conclave and congratulated him for the well-organised event. On the sidelines of GMC-2023, bilateral meetings were held among the Navy Commander, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera and Chief of the Naval Staff India, Admiral R. Hari Kumar, Flag Officer Commanding in Chief Western Naval Command India, Vice Admiral Dinesh K. Tripathi, Flag Officer Commanding in Chief Eastern Naval Command India, Vice Admiral Rajesh Pendharkar and Flag Officer Commanding in Chief Southern Naval Command India, Vice Admiral M.A. Hampiholi. Their discussions focused on several matters of mutual interest and bilateral nature while highlighting the long-standing relationship between the two countries. Further, the Navy Commander also explored the native advancements in the shipbuilding sector within the Indian Navy during this visit. Participating in such conclaves within the maritime community inevitably opens avenues for stakeholders to strengthen mutual cooperation and international relations. This, in turn, enables the effective addressing of emerging non-traditional maritime threats and other challenges in the Indian Ocean Region.

The Judge stated that the evidence placed before him, by the Chief Inspector-in-Charge of the raid and the WPC, who had frisked the accused, had been contradictory.

Judge Patabendige, addressing the WPC, sternly warned against her future conduct and advised her to desist from spreading lies, which could hinder her from performing her duty, to the satisfaction of the public.

He then warned that such embarrassing conduct would land her in hot water one day, if she fails to realise the seriousness of her conduct and rectify it promptly. The Judge stated that from the evidence given by the Chief Inspector, the raid to apprehend the accused had been carried out in the afternoon of 21 December, four years ago. But the Court stated that the WPC, attached to the Keselwatta Police, testifying before the State Counsel, had maintained that the drug was detected in a pocket of a dress, worn by the accused, following a raid done at dawn, on the said date. Following the hearing of evidence, the Judge instructed the accused to be acquitted from the charges filed against her and be released from the trial, whilst sternly warning the WPC, for having put forth bogus evidence before Court.

In light of this determination, Colombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya ruled that a criminal act has occurred in connection with this death. As a result, an order has been issued for the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to arrest the suspects and produce them in Court. The Additional Magistrate also ordered CID to obtain the instructions from the Attorney General for further investigations. A five-member committee of experts, including Forensic Medical Specialists and Judicial Medical Officers, was appointed to investigate the actual cause of the late businessman Schaffter’s death. The committee comprising Prof. Asela Mendis, Prof. D.C.R. Perera, Prof. D.N.P. Fernando, Dr. Siva Subramaniam and Dr. Rohan Ruwanpura submitted their findings from the post-mortem examinations to the Colombo Additional Magistrate’s Court on 31 October. As per the consensus of four out of five members of the expert committee, the apparent cause of death was identified as pressure applied to the neck and face of the deceased. Additional Magistrate Jayasuriya also ordered to provide copies of the expert committee report to the CID, the Attorney General’s Department and the relatives of the diseased. Dinesh Schaffter, Director of the Janashakthi PLC Group, was discovered bound in his car at the General Cemetery in Borella on 15 December 2022. He passed away one day later while receiving treatment at the ICU of the National Hospital Colombo. Suspended JMO Ruhul Haq initially concluded the death was a suicide and the body was buried in Borella Cemetery following a Court order. However, the deceased businessman’s relatives, who said that the death was suspicious, requested another postmortem. Accordingly, the expert committee chaired by Dr. Asela Mendis was appointed by the Court to exhume his body and conduct the requested post-mortem. The exhumed body of Schaffter was kept at the Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, for several months for the post-mortem and the expert committee held several rounds of discussions in Kandy to arrive at conclusions related to the death. The relatives also had sought permission from the court to allow their legal representatives to present information regarding the second post-mortem report after its submission. Additional Magistrate Jayasuriya, while denying the request, clarified that the primary purpose of a post-mortem examination is to determine the cause of death, and there is no legal provision for external parties to present additional information. Consequently, the Additional Magistrate instructed the CID to facilitate the handover of the late businessman’s remains, currently held at the Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, to his family. Furthermore, arrangements have been made for the burial of the remains at the Jawatte Cemetery in accordance with a previous Court order. It was revealed during the Police investigations that Dinesh Schaffter had left his house located in Flower Road, Cinnamon Gardens in the afternoon of 15 December 2022 and had bought food for two from a restaurant located on Malalasekara Mawatha, Colombo. Since his phone was not answered for a long time, Schaffter’s wife searched for his whereabouts through the GPS and she informed the Executive Director of the company after finding that his last location was shown as near the Borella Cemetery. Following that, Executive Director Kris Perera went to the Borella cemetery and found Schaffter’s car parked at the corner of the cemetery. It was seen that Schaffter was stuck on the driver’s seat of the car and that his hands and neck were tied with a wire. Although, he was rushed to the hospital, he died at midnight on 16 December 2022. Investigations were conducted based on a complaint made by the relatives to the Borella Police and later the investigations were handed over to the CID. No suspect has been arrested so far for the murder. The next hearing of the case will be on 20 March 2024. A group of lawyers including President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared on behalf of the aggrieved party and a group of lawyers including SSP Prashantha and ASP Kaluarachchi represented the CID.

The aid will benefit close to 15,000 people in the worst-hit localities in Sabaragamuwa, Southern and Western provinces.The EU funding supports the Sri Lankan Red Cross Society (SLRCS) in delivering emergency relief items, including drinking water, clothes, bed sheets and mosquito nets.

President of the AHP, Ravi Kumudesh on 31 October alleged that Dr. Wijewikrama could not escape from allegations that have been levelled against the NMRA. It is what paved the way to a medicinal drug monopoly and enabled decisions based on a single person’s opinion. He alleged that these weak points inthe NMRA Act were responsible for the problems in the State health service.  Dr. Wijewikrama and the team, which contributed to the Act, are directly responsible for discarding the opinion and recommendations of the end user, namely the medical laboratory scientists and technologists when purchasing equipment, including for laboratories, radiology and in the purchase of chemicals including laboratory reagents, he charged.  Also, those who have mastered regulatory science, procurement science and management science should be appointed to chief positions of the Authority in order to enter into the advanced methods of control and regulating. “It cannot be solved by clinical expertise alone. The AHP President warned they would keep a watchful eye on the newly appointed NMRA Chairman to see what course of action would be taken by him to rectify these drawbacks in the NMRA Act itself.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/11/01/over-800-train-journeys-cancelled-this-year/,Over 800 train journeys cancelled this year,Author not found,0,2023-10-31T20:36:00+00:00," From January to September this year, more than 800 train journeys had to be cancelled, primarily due to the failure of railway staff, including guards and drivers, to report to work during the final week of each month, Ceylon Today learns. According to a senior official of the Railways Department, many employees have a pattern of taking sick leave for at least six days in the last week of every month, which creates challenges in taking disciplinary action against them. As a result, the issue of over 800 cancelled train journeys during the past nine months has become a significant concern, and no solution has been found thus far. According to the official, this trend continued during the holiday week that began on Monday (27 October), with more than 40 train journeys being cancelled in the last four days alone. The disruption during the final week of each month has been particularly troublesome for train services. He pointed out that, after the monthly overtime period ends, some officials frequently report sick without returning to work. The lack of effective management exacerbates this problem. Speaking to Ceylon Today, W.A.D.S. Gunasinghe, General Manager of Railways, expressed his awareness of this recurring issue. He attributed it to the need for employees to cover vacancies and undertake additional duties, which often results in railway staff not showing up for work on weekends or during month-end periods. K.K.D. Prasad, Secretary of Railway Guards’ Union also noted that the allocated overtime period for each month coming to end and recent adverse weather conditions had left many employees physically unwell, contributing to the problem. He said such issues stem from factors like vacant positions and a lack of promotions within the Railways Department. The cancellation of train journeys is not solely the responsibility of train controllers; it also involves drivers and driver assistants not reporting for work, he added. Meanwhile, Secretary of the Ministry of Transport, M.M.P.K. Mayadunne, assured that an investigation into these matters would be conducted and necessary action would be taken promptly.

It was pointed out that foreign tourists frequently commute on the upcountry line and derailments inconvenienced them. The constant derailments on the upcountry line have deterred both local and foreign travellers from train travel. In particular, they highlighted that four derailments took place in October alone. On 16 October, there was a derailment between the Diyathalawa and Haputale railway stations. On 17 October, another incident occurred between the Bandarawela and Diyatalawa stations. Additionally, on 24 of October, a derailment took place between the Talawakelle and Watagoda stations and on 30 October, an incident was reported between the Kinigama and Hiloya stations. Commuters said when trains derail on the upcountry line, they were forced to undertake long walks to access buses, which is a significant challenge. Carrying luggage and goods becomes extremely burdensome, causing severe difficulties. Commuters appeal to the authorities to ensure proper maintenance of the upcountry line and prevent derailment.  BY Chandrasiri Mahagama – NuwaraEliya"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer.

Established in 1937, Maminiyawa Vidyalaya has enjoyed a long-standing reputation as one of the most esteemed educational institutions in the region. Over the years, it has accommodated students up to the Ordinary Level with an enrolment of over 250 students throughout its history. Regrettably, the present scenario paints a bleak picture, with only 26 students currently attending the primary section and the majority of its infrastructure lies in disrepair. Sugath Gunaratne, a resident in Maradankadawala, said “Our school possesses a wealth of dedicated educators, including the principal, all of whom make significant sacrifices to sustain our institution. Nonetheless, the number of enrolled students continues to dwindle daily. Not too long ago, Maminiyawa Vidyalaya was the largest educational institution in the area, nurturing many individuals who have gone on to become engineers, doctors, and lawyers. Today, it stands as a mere primary school, with just 26 students, of which 10 are in the sixth grade, and a mere four in the first grade. It is evident that the school is teetering on the brink of closure. We implore the authorities to devise a strategy to get students from the catchment area to enrol and safeguard the school’s future.” Nilanthi Pushpakumari further said the school’s deteriorating condition has led to its present state, adding , “Our school lacks a secure fence, resulting in continuous vandalising of infrastructure. Staff rooms lie in ruin, rendering them unusable. Unsavoury incidents take place in the school buildings after school hours. The restrooms have fallen into disrepair, leaving only one toilet for both students and staff. Many structures have fallen into decay due to disuse. We  request the authorities to intervene and protect the school’s valuable resources, averting its closure.” It is clear that Maminiyawa Primary School, once a pillar of education in the region, is now at risk, and the voices of concerned parents and community members plea for urgent measures to preserve the institution’s legacy and continue providing quality education to local children.

It’s akin to pouring water into a leaky vessel. While there’s much talk about revitalising the economy, there’s an alarming lack of focus on governance reforms and corruption prevention. The masses, who took to the streets in large numbers last year, demanded a ‘system change’ because they recognised that the country’s crisis was not solely economic but rooted in weak governance and deep-seated corruption.” She further explained, “Recognising the public’s heightened interest in anti-corruption, civil society organisations collectively worked on a Governance Diagnostic Report, highlighting a series of governance reforms essential for the nation. By advocating for these recommendations, we can bring about a real system change and ensure sustainable economic development.” ‘The Civil Society Governance Diagnostic Report,’ unveiled on 13 September, presented 34 pivotal governance benchmark recommendations. This comprehensive report was a joint effort by ‘The Civil Society Initiative on Anti-Corruption Reform for Economic Recovery,’ led by Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), in collaboration with a core group including Verité Research, the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA), Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement, People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), and the National Peace Council (NPC). The recent meeting aimed to raise awareness among civil society members about the recommendations in the report. As part of the discussion, civil society recommendations were compared with those made in the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recently issued report titled ‘Sri Lanka: Technical Assistance Report-Governance Diagnostic Assessment.’ Dr. Nishan de Mel, Executive Director of Verité Research, stressed the importance of good governance, citing historical data dating back to 1975. He pointed out that countries with multiple episodes of debt restructuring often scored lower in governance assessments. “Without addressing Sri Lanka’s governance issues, our efforts to rebuild the economy are akin to building a house without a solid foundation. Enhancing transparency and minimising discretionary powers are imperative for improving Sri Lanka’s governance indicators,” he underscored. He further warned, “Being content with temporary solutions is a costly mistake we’ve made repeatedly. The future of Sri Lanka now teeters on a precipice, with governance playing a pivotal role in determining whether we tread the right path or venture into dangerous territory.” Sankhitha Gunaratne, Deputy Executive Director of TISL, stressed the urgency of implementing the proposed governance reforms in their entirety and without delay. She pointed out that key measures, such as introducing new legislation for asset recovery and procurement, establishing a ‘Beneficial Ownership Registry,’ and making the asset declarations of high-ranking public officials accessible to the public, are emphasised in both reports. Professor Arjuna Parakrama, the researcher behind the Civil Society Governance Diagnostic Report, emphasised that these recommendations hold significance not only from an economic perspective but also in ensuring justice and fair play for the masses. The discussion also saw active participation from leaders of various organisations, including Rohana Hettiarachchi, Executive Director of PAFFREL; Dr. Vinya Ariyaratne, President of Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement; Dr. Jehan Perera, Executive Director of the National Peace Council; Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Executive Director of CPA; and Lasanthika Hettiarachchi, Advocacy and Research Manager at TISL. The governance reforms proposed in the 34 recommendations, derived from extensive islandwide consultation with grassroots citizens and experts alike, garnered overwhelming support from the civil society representatives who attended the discussion."

It was a very enriching experience,” he added. The event attracted over 100 small businesses and allied stakeholders and was the second in a series of similar events to be held across the country. The first event was held in Colombo in September. Small tourism businesses learned about digital marketing, travel trends and how to incorporate sustainability into their daily operations. Participants also had access to mentoring sessions with industry trailblazers and received toolkits focused on product development, marketing, promotions and sustainability. The Learning Expo was a direct follow-on of the launch of 12 new niche tourism categories in June this year, to enhance the competitiveness of small businesses and allow Sri Lanka to better establish its brand identity, increase its appeal and market share, create jobs and opportunities across the tourism sector, and generate much-needed foreign exchange. A wide variety of vendors showcased products that small businesses can use to enhance their services and incorporate sustainability into their supply chains. Sri Lanka’s diverse tourism offerings hold immense potential for small businesses to cater to the demands of both international and domestic travellers. To establish a thriving tourism sector, it is vital to empower small business owners to innovate, refine their products, and deliver sustainable guest experiences aligned with traveller expectations. Tourism is critical to Sri Lanka’s economy as it exits the pandemic and deals with its internal economic crisis.  Pre-pandemic tourism represented 12 per cent of the country’s GDP, generating USD 4.3 billion in revenue in 2018 and providing employment for three million people.  Sri Lanka is currently experiencing an encouraging resurgence in tourist arrivals and celebrated the landmark achievement of welcoming its one millionth visitor for 2023, in the last week of September, easily surpassing the figure of 720,000 recorded for the whole of 2022. Already popular as a tourism destination for its natural beauty and cultural heritage, in June this year, Sri Lanka repositioned its tourism offering with the launch of 12 new niche tourism categories – from adventure tourism and cultural experiences to hosted/curated experiences and wellness and healing – offering differentiated experiences for travellers seeking an immersive holiday. “I wish to thank USAID and SLTDA for conducting this very informative event which was a real eye-opener to most of us. We have been used to viewing tourism in a very old fashioned way that we have used for generations; today’s event showcased many exciting new approaches which will help us to better market our country and attract more tourists,” said Channa Saliya Mendis, Chairman of Southern Province Tourism Bureau. Niche tourism allows a destination to provide more inclusive opportunities for women, minority communities, and other disadvantaged groups by creating opportunities for them to participate in their own unique way. USAID launched the tourism activity under the Indo Pacific Opportunity Project (IPOP) in July 2022 to support economic reforms and promote foreign direct investment in Sri Lanka.  The two-year project is assisting SLTDA to streamline and implement new policies and procedures to enable fast-tracking and attraction of foreign direct investment in the tourism sector. The learning expo is yet another positive step taken by IPOP to boost Sri Lanka’s tourism industry and its economic recovery."

The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer.

Interpol said erectile dysfunction medications continue to be the most seized medicine globally, accounting for 22 per cent of seizures during the operation. Psychotherapeutic agents such as antidepressants, anti-anxiety medicines and stimulants were a close second at 19 per cent, followed by sex hormones and gastrointestinal medicines at 12 per cent respectively. Interpol said the additional seizures included, in Mozambique, authorities seized 9,000 bottles of suspected counterfeit cough syrups, after discovering contradictions between product labels and official documents. Australian authorities seized some 11,000 Covid-19 irregular test kits, demonstrating continued criminal exploitation of the pandemic. Customs officers in Qatar seized 2,500 prescription painkillers hidden in cereal boxes, from a passenger flying in from Bangladesh. Some 13,000 counterfeit and/or expired pain medicines were confiscated during searches at a bus depot between Peru and Ecuador. Secretary General of INTERPOL, Jürgen Stocksaid, “Counterfeit medicines and the misuse of regulated medication is a significant threat to public safety around the world. Operation Pangea XVI removed a large amount of illegal and potentially life-threatening products off the streets and dismantled criminal networks trafficking such goods.  “The operation underlines the continuing need for a coordinated and global response against the threat posed by illicit medicines and transnational organised crime groups.” Interpol had additional support from Europol, the World Customs Organisation, the World Health Organisation, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the International Narcotics Control Board, national health regulatory agencies and the Pharmaceutical Security Institute in the raid. The annual campaign targets illicit medicines that pose a significant threat to consumer safety, including counterfeit medicines and medicines diverted from legal and regulated supply chains.

In July 2022, the preliminary joint statement for the establishment of the proposed IOMed organisation had been issued and about 10 countries, including China had endorsed the joint declaration. Sri Lanka has sought observations from other government agencies, including the Ministry of Justice and the Attorney General’s Department, regarding the approval of the said Joint Statement on the Establishment of the International Organisation for Arbitration and it has been observed that the signing of the Joint statement will not affect any of the international obligations currently undertaken by Sri Lanka. Accordingly the Cabinet of Ministers approved the Proposal presented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to approve the Joint Statement on the Establishment of the International Organisation for Mediation. In February 2023 China established a Preparatory Office of the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to carry out inter-governmental negotiations over international conventions about the organisation. China said the IOMed will be the world’s first intergovernmental legal organisation dedicated to the settlement of international disputes through mediation. At the inauguration of the IOMed, China’s Foreign Minister Qin Gang said some countries, with their wanton practices of unilateralism and power politics, are going against the trend of history and eroding the international rule of law. In this  backdrop, he said, it is more imperative for China to firmly uphold the international system with the United Nations (UN) at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.

Dissanayake went on to say that historically, the governance of Sri Lanka has oscillated between the two main parties, the UNP and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and their respective alliances. In the past, people typically elected only a handful of JJB representatives to serve as legislative gatekeepers. According to Dissanayake, these representatives were never chosen to lead the government or even to function as the opposition party. Dissanayake claimed that due to significant changes in the country’s political landscape, the current Sri Lankan citizen has evolved and now expects a government led by the JJB. To facilitate this change, Dissanayake emphasised the importance of the current government in Sri Lanka ensuring that elections are held on schedule without delays. Addressing the Sri Lankan expatriate community, Dissanayake stressed on their vital role in making the aspirations of the Sri Lankan people, who desire this change a reality. He mentioned that if the JJB is to come to power at the upcoming election, an ideological struggle (Aragalaya) must be conducted to change the hearts and minds of the people. To achieve this, Dissanayake urged expatriates to utilise social media to influence the thinking of the Sri Lankan voter base. By Buwanaka S. Perera"

Furthermore, he noted that many buildings in Colombo were constructed without proper planning and structures that are 50-60 years old often lack fire prevention systems. Wilson emphasised the need for strict enforcement of the law against building owners who neglect safety measures, regardless of the awareness campaigns conducted. Additionally, the bustling traffic in the streets of Pettah further complicates their efforts, exacerbated by building owners neglecting proper fire safety measures. Wilson was raising concerns on the impediments faced by the fire brigade in responding to emergencies in the city, following the most recent fire in Pettah, in which more than 20 persons were hospitalised with severe burn injuries. Wilson pointed out that the recent fire threats in Colombo, were due to many old buildings lacking standard firefighting systems. Illegally conducted pavement trading obstructs the access of fire engines and emergency responders to the affected areas, creating a potentially hazardous situation. The careless placement of flammable objects on pavements was also highlighted as a fire risk, he added. In the event of a fire, if there is a lack of firefighting equipment or knowledge on how to use it, Wilson stressed the importance of informing those in the vicinity about the incident and evacuating the area promptly. Wilson raised concerns about spectators gathering to watch fires, hindering the fire brigade’s duties. He mentioned that some individuals approach fires to capture videos for social media, which can further complicate the situation. This influx of spectators can also disrupt ambulance and Police services. To address these challenges, Wilson suggested that the country’s legal framework related to fire prevention should be updated. He mentioned the development of an educational programme in collaboration with the Police to raise awareness about safety measures to prevent fires. BY Sachithra Perera"

He said the law applies to all persons and must be upheld equally, regardless of one’s social status. Wrongdoers should be held accountable under the law, irrespective of their standing in society. “I have confidence that President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena will take the necessary steps to provide equal rights to every citizen in the country, transcending ethical or territorial boundaries. Minister Devananda also said that the aspirations and hopes of the Tamil people can only be achieved through a constructive approach and meaningful dialogue with key decision-makers. He expressed his belief that staging protests or criticising the Government for narrow political gain would not lead to any positive outcomes, but rather complicate the process of finding a sustainable solution to the issues faced by the Tamil people. Devananda further pointed out that alongside the challenges faced by the Tamil people, there is a growing trend of religious-based issues in the Northern and Eastern provinces. Failure to address these problems could result in ethnic conflict. Despite numerous recommendations made by President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge to find a lasting solution to the issues of the Tamil people, Devananda lamented that the Tamil National Alliance has made little progress in resolving these long-standing issues. He also observed that the Tamil people were overconfident that struggles alone could bring about change. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva, was the Chief Guest. SLAVO is Sri Lanka’s premier and exclusive member-body representing ship-owners and principals and their direct interests in Sri Lanka. With its inception dating back to 1995 and hailed as one of the oldest associations in Sri Lanka’s maritime industry, SLAVO is actively consulted on matters concerning the industry and holds frequent dialogues with key government agencies, SLAVO said and added SLAVO is committed to promoting industry best practices among its members. It is also focused on liaising with the maritime industry ecosystem partners, such as authorities, State entities, and all other stakeholders, to ensure that international shipping lines utilise the Port of Colombo (POC) as a transshipment hub, thereby driving foreign exchange income generation and employment opportunities in Sri Lanka. Addressing the occasion, the Minister said he recognised the immense capacity, efficiency, dedication, and contribution of SLAVO to the nation-building efforts in Sri Lanka. “We are pleased to acknowledge that the Sri Lanka Association of Ship Owners (SLAO) plays a vital role, representing both ship owners, bulk carriers, and feeder vessels. It is an integral component of Sri Lanka’s maritime industry. Your operations, spanning across ports and maritime transportation in the Indian Ocean, significantly impact Sri Lanka’s reputation in the global maritime community,” he said. The Minister also remarked that the landscape of the maritime industry was rapidly evolving, with a strong emphasis on environmentally friendly practices. “Vessel owners worldwide are increasingly investing in green technology to reduce emissions. Consequently, our ports must be well-equipped to accommodate these eco-friendly vessels. Discussions in this regard have centered around green hydrogen, green ammonia, and enhanced connectivity. While Sri Lanka’s economy may not be as extensive as others, we must align with these global trends and deliver accordingly. This necessitates attracting investment for green hydrogen and green ammonia production in the Port of Colombo, a significant challenge globally in the upcoming years. We have already reached out to institutions for expertise in this regard,” the Minister said. Speaking further, the minister said, “To remain competitive globally, we must also focus on nurturing a new generation of professionals in the maritime sector. While those present here today have accumulated vast experience, it is crucial to encourage young individuals to embrace this industry. Our educational institutions must produce professionals who can compete on a global scale. Furthermore, pragmatic policies are essential to attract foreign and private investors for port development. Even in countries with strong economies like India, the private sector and foreign investments play a pivotal role. Therefore, our Government is committed to facilitating and supporting private sector growth. We currently have private terminals in our ports, and their efficiency should serve as a model for government-controlled terminals. In the near future, we plan to adopt a new model for the East Container Terminal, making it a more private-sector-oriented terminal, with our presence as far as the administration and other things are concerned. With the anticipated growth in the maritime sector, we may soon need additional terminals. Our ambitious North Port Development Project envisions four to six new terminals, all under private sector management, to attract further investment. Moreover, we recognise the need for a Port Community System (PCS) in the Port of Colombo. We are taking steps to address this, and expressions of interest from renowned organisations will be sought shortly. Additionally, we are aware of certain administrative issues within our ports, and we are committed to rectifying these concerns. Automation and closer collaboration with neighbouring countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are essential for the efficient movement of cargo through Sri Lanka’s ports. Politically, we are actively fostering relationships with key players in the region to attract more shipping lines and container ships to Sri Lanka. We aim to establish Sri Lanka as a strong hub in the Indian Ocean for transshipment. It is essential to embrace challenges and adapt to changing circumstances. The recent conflicts globally, including the events in the Middle East and Ukraine, remind us that unexpected events can impact our industry. However, the hallmark of successful businesses and entrepreneurs is their ability to adapt and innovate. Therefore, I encourage all present here to face these challenges with determination and creativity, ensuring the continued success of the maritime industry”, he concluded.

On Saturday, 7 October, Anula left the woman she was taking care of, Etty Morado, safely under a bed when she went to see what was going on. The monsters entered the room and shot Anula. Anula was lying near the bed protecting the elderly lady for three days and was found dead when the Israeli soldiers had walked in. This is how Anula sacrificed her life.

Many people from the area came to pay their last respects to her.” Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Israel, Nimal Bandara, stated that following the tragic loss of Anula, the family was able to confirm the identity of their mother when her body was shown to them via video conference. This confirmation made it unnecessary to conduct a DNA tests, he told Ceylon Today. “The family was able to recognize Anula’s body by identifying birthmarks and other distinct features, ultimately confirming that it was their beloved mother. Bernstein-Reich expressed her deep sorrow over the killing of Ratnayake of Kelaniya. She stated that Anula, who tragically lost her life, while working as a nurse near the Gaza Strip, continues to bring tears to those who knew her due to the kindness and love she showed to the elders of the family she served. She added that the members of several Sri Lankan families are among the people who came to Israel from countries all over the world who were helpless due to the inhuman attack by monsters on unarmed people. “The attackers shot and killed many unarmed people. Some children and even adults have been taken hostage and this is how Ratnayake was killed in Kibbutz Bari,” She added. The last rites for Anula were conducted at the residence where she had worked, before the body was dispatched to Sri Lanka.  The ceremony was attended yesterday (26), by Sri Lankan Embassy officials, her colleagues from the Sri Lankan community, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Directer of Overseas Employment, families who cared for Anula throughout the years, members of Kibbutz Bari, and individuals representing various religious sects.

Lanza made these comments during a media briefing yesterday. Expanding on his remarks, Lanza said, “The Cabinet reshuffle occurred after discussions between the President and SLPP leaders, particularly regarding the Health Ministry.” The primary concern of the SLPP General Secretary is not the reshuffling of the Health Ministry, but the allocation of most of these positions to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) rather than the SLPP. Merging the Ministry of Plantations with the Agriculture Ministry will allow these ministries to work more effectively together. Therefore, the President’s decision is a sensible one and should not be criticised. In the future, all State institutions to be privatised should fall under the purview of the Finance Ministry. I hope this will be implemented.” Lanza expressed his view that SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam is unaware of the careful planning behind the recent Cabinet reshuffle. He encouraged the SLPP to demonstrate their control over the government rather than making unfounded allegations behind the scenes. Lanza advised the SLPP General Secretary to communicate directly with the President if they are dissatisfied with his decisions and leave the government, rather than engaging in media performances. He challenged Kariyawasam and others to participate in a public debate on the topic, rather than making exaggerated claims in the media. Lanza emphasised that the Cabinet consists of MPs from various political parties and that the President has the constitutional authority to reshuffle positions based on his judgment, regardless of whether it’s the SLPP or SLFP. Lanza reflected on the past, mentioning that Ranil Wickremesinghe had to lead the country because the SLPP Government failed to meet the people’s expectations. He acknowledged being part of that regime, but claimed that the SLPP’s autocratic leadership caused their political journey to suffer. He argued that the current President inherited a financially troubled government and that providing immediate relief, as suggested by Namal Rajapaksa, is not feasible due to the conditions imposed by the IMF. Lanza supported the idea of an election to allow the people to choose their government. However, he expressed doubt that the SLPP would take such action because they may fear the consequences. He challenged them to accept his challenge if they have the courage. Finally, Lanza asserted that the President’s actions align with the desires of the people."

Wijesekera said as part of this initiative, EOIs will be solicited from both domestic and international developers for the construction of two floating solar power plants, each capable of generating 100 MW of power. On 23 October, Cabinet approved a proposal by the Ministry of Power and Energy, allowing for the solicitation of proposals for the development and execution of these proposed solar power plants. Interested parties are expected to adhere to the national procurement guidelines applicable to infrastructure facility projects. This decision was prompted by the recognition that constructing floating solar power plants on the surfaces of reservoirs is a more suitable solution for countries with limited available land for such projects. Consequently, approximately 100 hectares of the Samanalawewa Reservoir, under the purview of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), will be allocated for the establishment of a floating solar power plant.

Iceland already tops a World Economic Forum (WEF) ranking for gender equality, but organisers said the country needed to make even more progress and lead by example. “We are keenly aware that we have not reached gender equality, and even though the situation may be better than other places, there is no reason to just call it a day,” Steinunn Rognvaldsdottir, one of the organisers of “Kvennafri” (Women’s Day Off), told AFP. The protest day has been called six times since 1975, this was only the second time that organisers made it a full-day strike, she added. The other times, women walked off the job at a symbolic hour after which they were technically no longer earning a salary compared to male colleagues. The average wage gap between men and women was 10.2 per cent in 2021, according to Statistics Iceland. Around 90 per cent of Iceland’s women took part in the first protest in 1975, “which was momentous,” Rognvaldsdottir said. Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir was among those striking, her office told AFP. “She will not attend to official duties and in that regard, today’s scheduled cabinet meeting has been moved to tomorrow,” a spokesman said. Tens of thousands of women gathered for a large demonstration in the afternoon at the main square of the capital Reykjavik, and protests were also planned in other towns around the country of 400,000 people. In Reykjavik, where 75 per cent of city employees are women, 59 daycare centres and preschools were closed and all city services were affected by the strike. City employees taking part in the strike will not lose pay, the city said. Organisers of the movement said they expected men to take charge of the unpaid work that often falls to women. “For this one day, we expect husbands, fathers, brothers and uncles to take on the responsibilities related to family and home, for example: preparing breakfast and lunch boxes, remembering birthdays of relatives, buying a present for your mother-in-law, making a dentist appointment for your child.” “We always have to be on guard when it comes to our rights,” Lina Petra Thorarinsdottir, 45, told AFP. “In Iceland, we are proud of what we have accomplished and I am thankful for the women that came before us,” said Thorarinsdottir, Head of Tourism at marketing group Business Iceland. She said she would continue to protest until women enjoyed “equal rights in full.” The strikers also wanted their protest to raise awareness of gender-based violence. “We still see that up to 40 per cent of women have experienced some form of violence or will experience some form of violence in their lifetime,” Thorarinsdottir said. “The strike is for both equality when it comes to paid and unpaid work, it also has to do with violence against women and non-binary people,” she said. Fjola Helgadottir, a 41-year-old nurse, was unable to take part in Tuesday’s strike action. “I would have liked to participate in today’s protest but because we work in the children’s emergency room, we have to provide that service,” she told AFP.

This route is long and hard, but we need to pass it through. Otherwise the future of the whole World is in danger. It is a pity, of course, that the senior lecturer of the University of Kelaniya doesn’t recognise the very moment for the international relations and the order. This seems to result in the situation when a group of those dependent on the West mislead the youngsters and persuade them to follow these false believes. These actions have no connection to academic science, it is only a ghost of the dark colonial past, when Anglo-Saxon lie and double standards were obligatory to be repeated. Mr. Wijayantha “forgot” the well-known crimes of the Anglo-Saxons. Is he brave enough to criticize them in the situation of their vindictive unscrupulousness? For example, the US, the State that have made profit from all World Wars, that in 20 years of XXI century have invaded at least seven countries (Afghanistan, Iraq, Liberia, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Kameroon) situated thousands miles overseas. The State that has trampled the law and human rights in the Middle East, that created hundreds of hidden prisons for dissenters and claiming them to be terrorists conducted violent tortures against them? Or he has never heard how that country’s executioners distinguished themselves in Abu Ghraib or in Guantanamo (US-occupied territory of Cuba)? How does it comply with the UN Charter, a part of the founding fathers of which was for then Roosevelt administration? How often did they use their veto right? How often did they ignore the resolutions of the Security Council when they wanted to do it? Outrage upon the principles of the UN Charter is a hobby of the US leaders for the last 30 years. We know well who are these self-claimed “Leaders of the World”. We have been feeling this “democracy” and “love” by our own since the US and UK intervention in the beginning of the XX century, plans for a military operation codenamed “Unthinkable” with participation of the former Nazi army units against the USSR right after the end of the WWII and their significant efforts to eliminate the very name of Russia after the collapse of the USSR.

Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and President’s Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayaka said this initiative will empower the country’s Armed Forces and the State Intelligence Service to collaborate with international intelligence agencies in conducting necessary operations. Ratnayaka made these comments after inspecting the 200 kg of heroin, valued at Rs 4.5 billion, which was intercepted on the high seas and brought to the Colombo Port yesterday. Ratnayake emphasised that the drafting of essential legislation to create this ‘Anti-Narcotic Command’ is currently underway and will soon be presented to Parliament. Furthermore, Ratnayaka underscored that while 65 per cent of the drug raids result in arrests, the remaining 35 per cent continues to infiltrate the country. He stressed the urgency of implementing a modern programme aimed at entirely preventing the entry of drugs into the country. “First and foremost, I extend my congratulations to both the Navy and the Police Narcotics Bureau for successfully apprehending 200 kg of heroin. Remarkably, this marks the second substantial drug seizure within a brief span of time. The initial operation was executed based on intelligence provided by the Police Narcotics Bureau, while the most recent operation, according to information from the State Intelligence Service, was carried out by the Navy. The widespread global network of drug trafficking necessitates on-going efforts to safeguard our population from this peril. “In collaboration with the Navy, Police and various government agencies, Sri Lanka actively conducts drug raids. These endeavours result in the apprehension of approximately 65 per cent of drugs attempting to enter the country, with the remaining 35 per cent still making their way in. “According to the latest intelligence, these drug shipments arrive at the international maritime border via large vessels and are subsequently transported into the country by smaller boats. This expansive drug network poses a significant challenge. “Furthermore, there is a concerning possibility of arms trafficking intertwined with these drug trades. Vigilance in this regard is paramount, as it could pose a substantial threat to national security. To address these challenges, the development of new legislation is underway, with the creation of an Anti-Narcotic Command in progress. Proposed laws are in preparation and will be presented to Parliament for future implementation,” Ratnayake said. Meanwhile, Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said Sri Lanka Police and the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) will continue their crackdown on drug traffickers despite the threats and intimidation tactics. This statement was made yesterday (24) at a press conference held in Battarmulla. SSP Thalduwa said, despite the threats and intimidation faced by law enforcement agencies in the country, over 812 kilogrammes of heroin had been seized with the help of Sri Lanka Navy, the State Intelligence Services and Sri Lanka Coastguard, from January to October this year.  Responding to a question raised by Ceylon Today, the Media Spokesman said Sri Lanka Police officers and PNB officers had seen an increase in threats and intimidation from suspected drug traffickers and underworld masterminds in the recent years.  He added that unlike in the past most of the drug traffickers and ring leaders have moved abroad through illegal means and are now carrying out their operations from those cities. This includes trafficking, selling and other such organised crimes that are done through delegated criminals loyal to those individuals. SSP Thalduwa further said that this gives these traffickers a false sense of safety which emboldens them to threaten and intimidate officers. He went onto say that as these drug traffickers and their international networks are realising that the crackdowns are intensifying they will try to not only threaten but to persuade officers with the vast wealth at their disposal. SSP Thalduwa said that despite all these efforts Sri Lanka Police and PNB will work with other foreign law enforcement agencies and continue their crackdown on these traffickers and dismantle their criminal networks.

Fielding questions from the media, following the ceremony yesterday (24), at the Health Ministry, Dr. Pathirana said necessary decisions would be taken in this connection. With the recent economic crisis and the financial down turn, the government had to depend on certain credit methods. In the meantime, known long-term suppliers withdrew due to delay in payments and it resulted in a series of events that had taken place. On this basis the Ministry is obliged to take obligatory policy decisions to correct those matters. However those decisions would be taken as the country expects, Dr. Pathirana said.

The Minister also vowed to find solutions to the brain drain taking place amongst the medical fraternity. Several issues have arisen in this regard. He said that discussions would be held with the medical fraternity regarding policy issues to provide the necessary solutions within the available economic framework, Dr. Pathirana added.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Instead, the Ministry is diligently working on implementing a water tariff formula, set to roll out in January 2024, he added. Minister Thondaman also revealed that the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure is gearing up to honour the Upcountry community’s 200 years of contributions to the nation on 2 November. He assured the public that following the water tariff hike in August 2023, there will be no further increases. The focus is now on developing a cost recovery formula, a collaborative effort with the Water Board and Asian Development Bank (ADB) project, an integral part of a policy-based sub-programme. This sub-programme aims to contribute USD 100 million to the centralised budget upon completion. Minister Thondaman addressing the News Briefing, at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (24), under the theme ‘Collective path to a stable country’, clarified the government’s stance on water tariffs and announced initiatives to support the Upcountry community. He refuted the recent rumours about the current formula’s intention to guarantee fair water access while safeguarding those in vulnerable segments of society. These individuals are beneficiaries of social welfare programmes such as Samurdhi and Aswesuma, and this speculation is seen in light of the upcoming elections. The Minister emphasised that notably, of the approximately 2.96 million connections within the Water Board, the estate sectors are excluded, as they fall under the Rural Community Water Supply Department. This department extends its services not only to the estate community, but to all rural areas, working closely with 5,000 community-based organisations. Therefore, the water tariff in question applies exclusively to Water Board consumers. In addition to water-related matters, Minister Thondaman said that the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure is preparing to commemorate the Upcountry community’s contributions to the nation spanning two hundred years on 2 November. The Ministry is also actively engaged in initiatives aimed at benefiting the Upcountry community. A charter, featuring seven committees, has been formed within the ministry to address a wide range of issues specific to the plantation sector. These committees are dedicated to the economic uplift of women and children, on gender equality, health, education, sports and other activities. This charter will serve as a comprehensive guideline for all ministries, offering insights into how to address the unique concerns of the Upcountry community and reintegrate them into Sri Lankan society, ending their isolation within the plantation sector. Minister Thondaman underlined the significance of the Upcountry community, comprising approximately 200,000 estate worker families and roughly about 150,000 – 200,000 workers.  Further, an additional 800,000 to 1.2 million individuals, who are part of their families, reside within the estates. He stressed the importance of recognising not only estate workers but also the broader community and their identities in these endeavours. (GW)"

He remarked that he does not believe that his party, the SLPP has felt displeased over him being removed from his previous Cabinet Ministry post but noted that any political party could have internal reservations whenever Cabinet Ministry reshuffles occur.

The Court, elaborating on its verdict, stated that the decision taken by the State, to send nurses on compulsory retirement at age 60, had contributed in large measure, to a crisis situation within the country’s State hospital sector.  The Bench also added that currently a severe shortage of nurses and doctors has been evident within the Government Hospital sphere. It noted that this situation had resulted due to such persons going abroad in search of greener pastures and as a result of sending those aged above 60, into compulsory retirement without any consideration of its consequences to the public. The Appellate Court, then deemed that if this situation, is not addressed urgently, this country’s hospital sector could irreparably collapse sooner than later. The Court stressed that the respondents for their part, had also failed to convince the Bench, with regards to how they intend to resolve this burning medical issue and asserted that the said verdict, is being issued, having considered each of the aforementioned facts.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/25/visa-free-entry-for-tourists-from-seven-countries/,Visa-free entry for tourists from seven countries,Author not found,0,2023-10-24T20:33:00+00:00," Tourists from seven countries will have the opportunity to visit Sri Lanka visa-free until 31 March 2024, following the Cabinet granting its approval to such a proposal, aimed at promoting the tourism Industry.  Tourists from China, India, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan will now be able to visit Sri Lanka until 31 March 2024 visa-free. This would be enacted with immediate effect noted Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando. The Government has announced its commitment to enhancing foreign tourists’ access to world heritage and historical sites without being inconvenienced by traffic jams. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive single-payment package ticket will be introduced, allowing visitors to conveniently purchase it either at the airport or through an online system. As for visa fees, the Sri Lankan Government currently charges approximately USD 127.08 per Russian or Chinese tourist. For a Japanese tourist visa and ETA processing the fee is JPY 4,233 (equivalent to Rs 9,254.88). A Malaysian tourist pays USD 20 per head, while visitors from Thailand pay USD 50. An Indonesian tourist, on the other hand, pays a fee of Rs 49,700 while for an Indian it is INR 2,200. Asian tourist destinations are competing to raise their tourism market, which had fallen due to the Covid epidemic. Most of the countries are taking steps to provide visas free of charge to tourists. Therefore , several new tourism promotion programmes have been planned for the promotion of the Sri Lankan tourism industry, which is slow due to the Easter Sunday attack, the Covid epidemic and the subsequent serious economic crisis. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a joint proposal presented by the PrimeMinister, Minister of Tourism and Lands, Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Public Security with the aim of increasing the number of tourists coming to Sri Lanka to five million a year in the next three years. Also, to promote the tourism industry, a short-term strategy has been established, offering the option to obtain tickets for Sri Lanka Railways’ tourist coaches via an online system or purchase them at the airport as one-time tickets.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/25/reserves-bleed-by-usd-10-63m/,Reserves bleed by USD 10.63M,Author not found,0,2023-10-24T20:33:00+00:00," The country’s foreign reserves bled by USD 10.63 million (Rs 3,466 million) yesterday, led by Government of Sri Lanka’s foreign debt servicing commitments to multilateral donors.  Consequently GoSL’s non-demand-pull inflationary face value money printing (FVMP) debt increased by Rs 3,466 million yesterday due to inadequate revenue to buy the required US dollars (foreign exchange/FX) from the country’s foreign reserves to service such foreign debt commitments. Subsequently, GoSL’s FVMP debt as a whole increased by 0.03 per cent to Rs 3,024,600.63 million (Rs 3.0246 trillion) yesterday. However, year on year (YoY) to  yesterday, GoSL’s FVMP debt has been reduced by at least a massive Rs 2,924,781.50 million(Rs 2.9248 trillion/49.16 per cent) aided by the recent tax and utility rate hikes, thereby helping  to negate demand-pull inflationary pressure by a large measure. Yesterday’s FVMP debt reduction is also the second largest of such reductions, the largest being a reduction totalling at least Rs 2.9256 trillion) which took place only on the previous day Monday (23). But in the obverse, high tax and utility bills may destablise the political and socioeconomic fabric of the country if unsupported by growth, employment and better employment opportunities.  Meanwhile, yesterday’s FVMP debt of Rs 3,024,600.63 million includes previous provisional advances to GoSL and Treasury (T)-Bill purchases from the primary market amounting to Rs 2,713,144,352,010 (Rs 2.7131 trillion/Rs 2,713,144.35 million) in full made by Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which, as per IMF diktats, were converted to T-Bills and T-Bonds on 21 September 2023, with their dates of maturities ranging as early as 9 February 2024 and as late as 15 June 2038, respectively. Presuming that a year ago too those provisional advances and primary market T-Bill purchases made by CBSL amounted to at least Rs 2,713,144.35 million (though, in actual fact it would have had been much more!), then, CBSL’s FVMP debt would have had swelled to at least Rs 5,949,382.13 million (Rs 5.9494 trillion) on that day (Friday 21.10.22. Monday 24.10.2022 was a holiday to the markets).  CBSL lacks transparency to make accurate deducements. Further, in making yesterday’s decrease in the country’s foreign reserves deducement, swap settlements between CBSL and the market or CBSL and the GoSL and CBSL’s  sales of FX to the market to prevent rupee depreciation due to demand, are discounted.  GoSL’s FVMP debt in this instance is taken to be equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T-Bill and T-Bond holdings. When there are sufficient revenues, CBSL/GoSL can retire maturing T-Bills and T-Bonds without having those to be reissued to CBSL (the creditor), as the latter and its agents (Ceylon Electricity Board, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, etc.) are compensated for giving GoSL and its agents (debtor) credit previously, by being repaid their dues upon maturity of such instruments (T-Bills and T-Bonds) by enhanced tax and utility bill collections, thereby resulting in the retiring of such T-Bills and T-Bonds, leading to a reduction in such holdings by CBSL. Consequently, a reduction in circulated money or money printing as well, due to these actions, where CBSL is repaid for previously buying such T-Bills and T-Bonds issued by GoSL on behalf of its agents or to it, itself (GoSL), upon the maturity of such instruments, aided by enhanced tax and utility bill collections by GoSL and its agents results in such money going back to CBSL’s godowns and being removed from circulation, thereby nullifying demand-pull inflationary pressure. CBSL, at least historically, used to print rupees when GoSL and its agents do not have sufficient revenues/money to meet their commitments, or to buy the required FX from the country’s foreign reserves to meet foreign debt service commitments, in this instance to multilateral donor agencies. However, the danger in money printing (MP) is that if it enters the domestic market, it causes demand-pull inflationary pressure. Investing in T Bills and T-Bonds is generally considered as being riskless, because, in the event GoSL is unable to repay such debt, CBSL is normally mandated to print demand pull inflationary money and repay such creditors. CBSL has the sole right to print rupees.  Nonetheless, the new CBSL Act has controlled CBSL’s money printing activities to a great extent. Conversions are based on Friday’s (20) offer rate of the benchmark ‘spot’ which was Rs 326 to the dollar. Swaps between CBSL and GoSL are foreign reserves neutral. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days of trading. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and of its foreign reserves, deals in ‘spot.’ By Paneetha Ameresekere"

Wijeyawardene Mawatha in Colombo, when the weapon of a Police officer, attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB), had misfired while taking two suspects into custody. Speaking at a press conference held last evening, the Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said, a group of officers attached to the PNB took two individuals into custody when they arrived at the Central Mail Exchange to claim a parcel. According to SSP Thalduwa, the parcel, addressed to an apparent female resident in Mattakuliya, had arrived at the Central Mail Exchange last Saturday (21) after which a 45-year-old male employee at the Central Mail Exchange had come with a letter written by the said woman, and her NIC to claim the parcel. When the Sri Lanka Customs officers had asked the man to open the parcel, they found that the parcel contains five kilograms of cannabis and the man fled the scene. “Later, with the help of the Central Mail Exchange employees and the PNB we found that the said individual has worked with another employee from Sri Lanka Post to release the parcel,” said SSP Thalduwa. He elaborated that following interrogations the PNB found that the two Sri Lanka Post employees were working for another 31-year-old resident in Ratthanapitiya, Horana who had instructed them to retrieve the package. The PNB has decided to apprehend the 31- year- old suspect when he arrived at the Central Mail Exchange yesterday afternoon. SSP Thalduwa said the suspect who arrived at the Central Mail Exchange in a luxury vehicle, fearing that he was to be arrested, had decided to flee the scene, during which a Police officer’s gun had misfired once and this had caused the suspect to surrender. No one was harmed in the incident and according to SSP Thalduwa the people in the vicinity have misunderstood the arrest as abduction and had ignorantly spread misinformation about the incident on social media. SSP Thalduwa reassured that the PNB and Sri Lanka Police are carrying out further investigation into the matter. SSP Thalduwa also claimed that Sri Lanka has seen a spike in recent years with regard to the quantity of cannabis that is smuggled into the country via commercial aircrafts. He also said that it isn’t exclusive to Cannabis or Marijuana but is becoming the popular mode of trafficking for most of the high scale illicit drugs. By Buwanaka S. Perera"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Rambukwella came under severe criticism for making the country’s Health sector, which was once considered as being up to international standards, deteriorate during his tenure. He remained nonchalant despite calls, protests and sathyagraha demanding his resignation.

There are only five such MPs supporting the President in the SLFP. Thus, it is wrong of the President to remove a ministerial portfolio from an SLPP MP, and give it to an MP belonging to the SLFP, and to also give another SLFP member the portfolio of a State Minister. We are unhappy about this decision. It was a wrong thing to do. We are not afraid to say when something is wrong. If an act is wrong, it is wrong, even if it is committed by the President,” the SLPP General Secretary stressed.

Hence, he has urged Anula’s two children, a 29-year-old son and a 23-year-old daughter, to submit their DNA test sample reports to verify the situation. The children, who live in Kelaniya, have said that they cannot identify the body as it’s beyond recognition. “I am waiting for the report to visit the mortuary.” Currently, the body is at the Tel Aviv Police mortuary, according to the Ambassador. “The body is believed to be in a state beyond recognition and the family maintains the belief that their mother is still alive. To avoid any doubts, it has been decided to confirm through DNA testing before sending the remains to the family. They will send the report through the Foreign Ministry.”  Additionally, the family of Yatawara Bandara from Wennappuwa, who has been missing since the raid, has been asked to submit DNA reports of his son and daughter in case any news emerges. In the meantime, there are speculations that many Sri Lankans are attempting to enter Israel through the Jordan border in search of jobs, possibly misled by job agencies. While there have been many reports of such attempts, the Ambassador mentioned that there is no official confirmation. He explained that there is a wide border on the West Bank north of Israel where people can attempt to enter. Tourist entry into Israel is currently restricted due to the ongoing situation, but some individuals are still trying to enter. The Israeli Border Police are monitoring the situation, and so far, there is no information regarding any arrests, noted the Ambassador. The Sri Lankan Bureau of Foreign Employment has urged Sri Lankans not to cross the border nor be deceived by racketeers. They said there are currently no employment opportunities in Israel and going there is a risk. Only two Sri Lankans were caught in the war between Israel and Hamas, where Hamas abducted as many as 222 people, including Israelis and foreigners.

Minister Wijesekera further emphasised that a mechanism will be developed immediately for a systematic approach to revise the electricity bill once in every six months.   The Minister revealed this during a press conference held yesterday (23) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), under the theme ‘Collective Path to a stable country’. The Minister, providing additional insights, remarked that the Public Utilities Commission had recently approved a revision of electricity tariffs for the Electricity Board. Consequently, preparations we made to implement an approximate 18% rate adjustment, effective from the 21 October, with subsequent rate evaluations for the coming months. This price revision adheres to the government’s policy framework established in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Pursuant to this framework, no State enterprise is permitted to draw funds from the Treasury to cover its financial losses. Consequently, a specialised price formula has been devised for both the Electricity Board and the Petroleum Corporation. Addressing a prevalent misconception within society, the Minister clarified that the Electricity Board is not confined to revising tariffs only twice a year. Provisions are in place for tariff adjustments in cases of emergency and the necessary Cabinet approval has been secured for this purpose. Furthermore, the Minister also revealed the on-going restructuring efforts of the Electricity Board. The proposals for this endeavour were previously submitted and are presently under consideration by the Legal Draftsman’s Office. The office has finalised its review and has forwarded the proposal to the Attorney General. On a positive note, the Attorney General recently conveyed plans to provide the requisite clarifications within the week, thus facilitating the proposal’s presentation to the Cabinet in the forthcoming week. These developments indicate a significant step forward in the restructuring programme. Moreover, it has come to the attention that there is a prevailing public sentiment regarding the need for a tariff revision due to the current heavy rainfall. It is pertinent to note that not only the Matara District, which I have the privilege of representing, but also the neighbouring Galle District and the Gampaha District have experienced flooding as a result of these meteorological conditions. In light of recent heavy rainfall and its implications for electricity production, it is essential to recognise that the primary reservoirs responsible for hydroelectric power generation, namely Samanala Lake, Victoria, and Randenigala, remain within their existing capacities. The rainfall in these regions has been below the typical levels.  “As of today, we are utilising only 65.81% of the reservoir capacity, a stark contrast to the 84.41% capacity utilisation observed by 22 October 2022. This represents a considerable 20% decrease. Comparatively, the hydroelectricity production from our reservoirs in 2022 reached 5,364 gigawatt hours, a significant decline from 5,639 gigawatt hours in 2021. By 22 October 2023, the figure stands at 2,893 gigawatt hours, only half of the corresponding output in the preceding years. With a mere 70 days remaining in the year, there is uncertainty regarding our ability to meet these targets. Consequently, the exploration of alternative measures is imperative to ensure the continued supply of electricity. (GW)"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/24/pickme-probes-alleged-data-breach/,PickMe probes alleged data breach,Author not found,0,2023-10-23T20:33:00+00:00," Allegations of a data breach, involving one of the biggest ride-hailing platforms in Sri Lanka, PickMe, have emerged on social media with certain members of the public referring to a “leaker” of the information, who claims that over 4 million PickMe customer records have been compromised due to the data breach. According to this claim, it is being speculated that a wide array of sensitive and confidential information, including 1.8 million email addresses, 2.8 million phone numbers and another 1.4 million hashed passwords have been leaked. PickMe started its operations eight years ago and has facilitated a 100 million rides to commuters around Sri Lanka up to this year. Speaking to Ceylon Today in response to the allegations, the PickMe’s Chief Marketing Officer Mohan Gamage said that this matter was brought to public attention last August following which PickMe carried out extensive investigation on whether an internal security breach has occurred. The investigations ultimately confirmed that neither a personal information breach nor a breach in financial data of customers had occurred. Gamage further said that the ‘four million’ claim is factually incorrect and misleading and speculates whether the purported ‘leak’ was more of an attempt to damage the company’s reputation than it being a security concern. Commenting on the surge in which PickMe users are removing their credit/debit card details from the application, Gamage stated that as PickMe does not store any credit/debit card information and instead PickMe ‘Tokenise’ it as a safety measure. Tokenisation, according to Gamage, is the process of replacing sensitive data with unique identification symbols that retain all the essential information about the data without compromising its security with the company. Hence, Gamage claims that it is almost impossible to have such information leaked out. He further requested the PickMe application users to continue using their card payment methods as it is a safe and secure facility that has been provided by the company to give more comfort for the passengers. Nevertheless, Gamage said that the company is concerned about these allegations and will look into them. Regarding the incident, Ceylon Today spoke to prominent cyber security expert Asela Waidyalankara, who said that such data breaches, if occurred, aren’t exclusive to a particular company and that such breaches happen globally. He added that as Sri Lanka does not have a specific authority to look into such matters and as a general rule to practice more caution as citizens when sharing personal and financial details online.

Farmers have continuously requested the Ministry of Agriculture to provide shot guns to prevent crop damage caused by wild animals. Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera attended all the district agricultural committee meetings of the Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Jaffna and Puttalam Districts and even at those meetings the farmers requested for shot guns. At present, crop damage caused by wild animals has increased and among the animals that cause crop damage, Toque monkeys, peacocks and Giant Squirrels are the most prominent. Currently, these animals have been removed from the protected animal list and wild elephants are still included in the protected animal list. Although the farmers demanded shot guns to prevent crop damage by wild animals, the Ministry of Agriculture started distributing air rifles at a concessional price from Sunday (22). The Minister of Agriculture started the distribution of air rifles to farmers at a programme held in Angunakolapalasse. Accordingly, arrangements had been made to distribute 268 air rifles to the farmers yesterday. The minister said that crop damage caused by wild animals has increased and farmers are constantly requesting to provide them with shot guns to prevent crop damage. “Crop damage is mostly caused by toque monkeys. Because of this, even though the initial steps were taken to provide 100,000 toque monkeys to zoos in China, the programme was disrupted due to lawsuits filed by environmental organisations. However, as there is a risk of a future food crisis, the destruction of cultivated crops by wild animals has created a serious crisis. Proposals presented by these environmental organisations to prevent crop damage caused by animals are not practical at all. The Minister also mentioned that the suggestions presented by these environmental organisations included hanging saris around the cultivated lands, plates tied to the coconut trees and half an acre of cultivated farms should be set aside for wild animals. Therefore, in an effort to prevent crop damage, measures were taken to distribute air rifles at the request of farmers, and the government has allocated the funds for this purpose this year, the minister said. However, the Minister stated that they cannot give shot guns to harm the animals, and asked farmers not to use these air rifles to kill animals, but only to drive them away and not to use these air rifles to injure people under any circumstances. He also mentioned that if any farmer uses these air rifles to harm people, The law would be enforced against them. (HN)"

A special monitoring mechanism should be introduced to safeguard the migrant workers of Sri Lanka with the support of the International Labour Organization (ILO),” Minister Jeevan Thondaman said when he met ILO Director-General Gilbert F. Houngbo in Geneva. General Secretary of the Ceylon Workers’ Congress and Cabinet Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman and his delegation made an official visit to Geneva to attend the Global Trade Union Congress of Public Services International. During their visit to Geneva, they had high-level meetings with many international organisations. Minister Thondaman held a discussion with Houngbo at the ILO Headquarters in Geneva. Minister Thondaman further said, “The plantation sector workers of Sri Lanka, who had been the largest contributing element of the Sri Lankan economy, are stepping into the 200th year from their arrival as indentured labourers during the colonial period. In the past, they faced much discrimination, exploitation, and violations. However, with great striving and the support of the Ceylon Workers’ Congress, the community has excelled in various sectors along with the other communities in Sri Lanka. Greater attention will have to be provided to further enhance the economic, health, and education conditions of the community and to revive the historical mistreatment during the colonial era of Sri Lanka.” He highlighted that when workers are exploited by employers, the CWC being one of the pioneer and largest trade unions in South Asia, defends them and ensures their welfare. Minister Thondaman expressed his concern over the proposed Employment Act. He stated, “I have expressed my concerns to the Minister of Labour on the proposed reform of the Labour law in Sri Lanka. Even though 44 laws are in existence in the law only 17 laws are being practiced. All trade unions demanded labour law reform; however, the proposed draft was not what we expected. Therefore, I had a special meeting with all the trade unions representing the National Labour Advisory Council to inform the authorities and the Minister we are not in favour of the proposed reform and the due diligence should be incorporated with the consultation with the NLAC.” The world of work has transformed during and after the Covid-19 pandemic, while Sri Lanka has experienced an unprecedented economic crisis that largely affected the working class. The plantation workers’ wages had become inconsistent and fragile. Subsequent to the abrogation of the collective agreement of the Employers’ Federation of Ceylon, there had not been an increment in daily or monthly wages of the plantation workers for more than two years, despite the cost of living being skyrocketed. “We have informed the EFC and the Regional Plantation Companies to come up with a uniform tea partnership model where the workers will be plot managers and it will increase the productivity of the plantation industry. Unfortunately, there had been no positive feedback from the employers,” Minister Thondaman said. In the recent past, there have been several workplace accidents. Many innocent workers lost their lives or became permanently or partly disabled. To mitigate this, a special ‘Insurance Scheme’ was introduced for the workers and their families to ensure their safety with the collaboration of the State-owned Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and the Plantation Human Development Trust. “However, we have to take preventive measures to address possible accidents and provide the workers with a safe environment of work,” he added. Minister Thondaman further raised an alarming concern about migrant workers. Due to the economic crisis, many Sri Lankans have left the country seeking employment. However, it was reported that workers who are going as domestic workers are exposed to greater exploitation and grave dangers. These exploitations range from underpaying to sexual abuse, and assault. It was shocking to know that recently a female worker was found with iron nails inserted into her body by their employer. Therefore, the Minister requested the ILO to formulate a special monitoring plan to address these serious concerns which could be a tripartite process to ensure the safety of our migrant workers. Gilbert F. Houngbo, Director-General of the ILO, agreed to support the request of the Ceylon Workers’ Congress and he had assigned a team of experts to introduce the best practices of the Philippines in relation to migrant worker protection. He also thanked Minister Thondaman for defending trade union rights and ensured ILO will always support the activities to defend workers in Sri Lanka. The delegation also thanked the DG and his team and Simrin Singh, Country Director of ILO Sri Lanka, for their support of the trade unions and for ensuring the rights of workers. This meeting was also joined by Barath Arullsamy, Vice President of CWC and Chairman of Plantation Human Development Trust; Aritha Wickramasinghe, Advisor to Minister; Maria Helena, Director of Bureau for Workers’ Activities, and Hitomi Nakagome, Senior Advisor of ILO."

Accordingly the Apex Court, dismissed the appeal petition filed against the order issued by the Colombo Commercial High Court (CCHC), without taking it up for consideration. The case was called up, before a Supreme Court Bench, comprising Justices Preethi Surasena, Shiran Guneratne and Priyantha Fernando. The SC thus rejected the appeal petition filed by R. K. R. Electronic Private Limited of Colombo 3, along with Sri Skandaraja Rajiv Kumar, against the intellectual Properties Act case, filed by the Chint Group Corporation of China and Chint Electric Company, before the CCHC. The Chint Corporation of China had recently informed the CCHC, that the accused firm had flouted Provisions contained in Section 160 (1) of the Intellectual Properties Act and charged, that the firm in question (Chint Power Solutions Private Limited), had distributed electric items, similar to the brand name of the Chint Corporation of China. Attorneys-at-Law Manoj Bandara and Thivanka Hettiarachchi, appearing for the plaintiff firm, informed the SC, that CCHC Judge Pradeep Hettiarachchi had imposed the interim injunction, on 2 March last year. They further informed the Supreme Court Bench, that the Chint Group Corporation, which had been started in 1984, had proceeded to emerge as the largest manufacturer, producer and supplier of smart energy technology and such equipment in the world and that its network, had been spread across 140 countries in the world. The lawyers explained that the Chint brand name, had existed in the Sri Lankan market since 2008 and that due to the superior quality, its products had become popular amongst consumers here. They added that the accused firm, Chint Power Solutions Private Limited, had proceeded to illegally utilise the brand name of Chint Group Corporation, whilst engaging in distributing and selling its products to the local market, with the sinister intention of earning profits fraudulently, while containing the brand name ‘Chint Power’. The lawyers alleged that the accused firm, had resorted to its unlawful actions, without due approval from the plaintiff firm and having registered the brand name ‘Chint Power’ secretly, they had violated Provisions contained in Sections of the Intellectual Properties Act via their actions. President’s Counsel Kuvera de Soyza, instructed by Attorney-at-Law Sanjaya Fonseka, appeared for the appeal petitioner. The three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court, having perused the submissions produced by both, the accused party and the plaintiff firm, decided to throw out the appeal petition challenging the interim injunction imposed by the CCHC, without taking it up for hearing. The dismissal of the appeal petition by the Supreme Court is due to be read out before the Colombo Commercial High Court on 23 November. BY Hansi Nanayakkara"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/24/new-health-minister-should-focus-on-patients-wellbeing/,New Health Minister should focus on patients’ wellbeing,Author not found,0,2023-10-23T20:31:00+00:00," Unlike outgoing Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, the newly appointed Minister of Health, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana should make the patients’ wellbeing his focal point while endeavouring to promote team work within the State health service.  CMLSSL President Ravi Kumudesh, when contacted yesterday (23), said there were strong possibilities of the new Minister of Health being biased towards medical practitioners as he too was one. However, he should endeavour to remember that there is a gamut of non-medical staff within the health service who contribute towards the smooth functioning of that service. Kumudesh accused Rambukwella of having forgotten this salient factor. The Minister made the mistake of thinking that the Medical Supplies Division (MSD), State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC), the State Pharmaceutical Corporation and the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) was the entire State health service as it was where the money and the commissions were. In other words he allowed himself to be blinded by the drug mafia and forgot the patient community dependant on the free health service. Kumudesh lashing out alleged that this uncaring attitude of Minister Rambukwella had led to the Ministry officials also working with vested interests while the Deputy Directors General (DDGs) in the Health Ministry formed an entity of their own leaving out the non-medical staff of the health service out in the cold.  The shortcoming in management and administration of the State health service has brought the service to a point when the NMRA, tasked with regulating the pharmaceuticals imported to the country or being manufactured within has now been reduced to letterhead and a rubber seal which they cannot safeguard.  Meanwhile, President of the Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association of Doctors (MCPA), Dr. Chamal Sanjeeva  said that Public Administration Ministries such as the President’s Office and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)  should urgently conduct investigations into corrupt transactions of the Health Secretary, the Director General Health Services, the Additional Secretaries, the Presidents of the State Pharmaceutical Corporation, the officers of the NMRA, which have been exposed with evidence.  Failing to do so is a grievous injustice towards the people of this country, he alleged. Dr. Sanjeva warned that the public would even take a decision with regard to the newly appointed Health Minister, Dr. Pathirana if he too works in collaboration with the corrupt officials of the Health Ministry and fails to take action against the corruption and malpractices.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/24/high-tax-utility-bills-down-mp-by-record-rs-2-93t/,"High tax, utility bills down MP by record Rs 2.93T",Author not found,0,2023-10-23T20:31:00+00:00," The fall in Government of Sri Lanka’s (GoSL’s) face value money printing (FVMP) debt year-on-year (YoY) to yesterday (23) moved closer to the three trillion rupees mark,  increasing by at least to a record Rs 2,925,639.50 million (Rs 2.93 trillion), Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL’s), daily open market operations (OMO) data showed. The previous record was at least 2,900,318.90 million (Rs 2.90 trillion),  established only on the previous Monday (16). Such a sharp reduction (Rs 2.93 trillion) in FVMP debt is possible due to the recent hikes in tax and utility bills. Such a sharp YoY fall in FVMP debt to yesterday helps negates demand-pull inflationary pressure by a large measure. Consequently, whereas a year ago in September 2022 Sri Lanka’s inflation had risen to a record high 73.7 per cent, YoY, it has however since, fallen steeply to 0.1 per cent YoY  to September 2023, Census and Statistics Department’s yesterday’s data showed. But in the obverse, high tax and utility bills which aided in this massive reduction in MP run the risk of destablising the political and socioeconomic fabric of the country if unsupported by growth, employment and better employment opportunities.  Meanwhile, the settlement of swaps between the CBSL and the GoSL, where the former swapped foreign exchange (FX/US dollars) for rupees, increased market’s net shortfall by 2,592.50 per cent (Rs 174,320 million) to Rs 181,044 million yesterday. The value of yesterday’s swap settlements was Rs 156,325 million (USD 480.63 million). Yesterday’s FVMP debt amounted to Rs 3,023,742.63 million, a decrease of 0.59 per cent (Rs 17,995 million), over that of the previous market day Friday (20). This Rs 3,023,742.63 million FVMP debt of yesterday’s includes previous provisional advances to GoSL and Treasury (T)-Bill purchases from the primary market amounting to Rs 2,713,144,352,010 (Rs 2.7131 trillion/Rs 2,713,144.35 million) in full made by CBSL, which, as per IMF diktats, were converted to T-Bills and T-Bonds on 21 September 2023, with their maturities ranging from a minimum of 9 February 2024 to a maximum of 15 June 2038. Presuming that a year ago too those provisional advances and primary market T-Bill purchases made by CBSL amounted to at least Rs 2,713,144.35 million (though, in actual fact it would have had been much more!), then, CBSL’s FVMP debt would have had swelled to at least Rs 5,949,382.13 million (Rs 5.9494 trillion) on that day.  CBSL lacks transparency to make accurate deducements. Further, in making yesterday’s swaps deducements, swap settlements between CBSL and the market or the repayment of GoSL’s loan instalments to multilateral donors or the settlement of CBSL’s US dollar/foreign exchange (FX) sales to the market to stablise the rupee are discounted. CBSL’s daily open market operations (OMO) from which such deducements are made, lack transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt in this instance is taken to be equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T-Bill and T-Bond holdings. However, when there are sufficient revenues, CBSL/GoSL can retire maturing T-Bills and T-Bonds without having those to be reissued to CBSL (the creditor), as GoSL and its agents (Ceylon Electricity Board, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, etc.) are compensated for giving GoSL and its agents (debttr) credit previously, by being repaid their dues by the consumer and in turn to the CBSL, aided by high tax and utility bills, , thereby resulting in the retiring of such T-Bills and T-Bonds upon their maturities, leading to a reduction in such holdings by CBSL.  This, consequently, leads to a reduction in circulated money or money printing due to such actions, with such money going back to CBSL’s godowns and being removed from circulation, thereby nullifying demand-pull inflationary pressure. CBSL, at least historically, used to print rupees when GoSL and its agents do not have sufficient revenues/money to meet their commitments, or to buy the required FX from the country’s foreign reserves to meet foreign debt service commitments, in this instance to multilateral donor agencies. However, the danger in money printing (MP) is that if it enters the domestic market, it causes demand-pull inflationary pressure. Investing in T-Bills and T-Bonds is generally considered as being riskless, because, in the event GoSL is unable to repay such debt, CBSL is normally mandated to print demand pull inflationary money and repay such creditors. CBSL has the sole right to print rupees.  Nonetheless, the new CBSL Act has controlled CBSL’s money printing activities to a great extent. Conversions are based on Thursday’s (19) offer rate of the benchmark ‘spot’ which was Rs 325.25 to the dollar. Swaps between CBSL and GoSL are foreign reserves neutral. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days of trading. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and of its foreign reserves, deals in ‘spot’.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Including the latest seizure, the Sri Lanka Navy has held drugs with a gross street value of over Rs 15,160 million during operations mounted in 2023. According to the Sri Lanka Navy, the multi-day fishing craft was seized in a deep-sea operation conducted by the Intelligence Division of the SLN together with the PNB based on information derived from a coordinated intelligence operation. The drug-laden local multi-day fishing trawler was intercepted by SLCG Samudraraksha. The intercepted local multi-day fishing trawler was escorted to the Dondra fisheries harbour, where a careful search with the Sri Lanka Coast Guard revealed over 212 kg (including packages) of heroin and crystal methamphetamine (ice) were on board. The special operation mounted about 91 nautical miles (about 168 km) west of Galle, also led to the arrest of suspects aboard. Navy Commander, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, arrived at the Dondra fisheries harbour to personally inspect the seized consignment of narcotics. The Navy said they collaborate closely with the country’s law enforcement agencies, conducting regular operations in island waters with constant vigil to realise the national aspiration of eliminating the drug menace in Sri Lanka. On being brought ashore, the suspicious trawler underwent a thorough search where 160 packages of heroin, weighing about 180.8 kg (including packages), and 28 parcels of crystal methamphetamine, weighing around 31.5 kg (including packages), contained in 12 sacks were recovered. The suspects arrested in this operation are residents of Dondra and Kottegoda areas and are aged 26-53. The suspects, along with the stock of narcotics and the fishing trawler, were handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau for onward legal action. By Gagani Weerakoon"

Union chief Upul Rohana said the strike aims to draw attention to the non-provision of solutions to issues faced by the Public Health Inspectors. One of the key concerns is the failure to increase the mileage rent and transport allowance provided for field duties. These allowances have not kept pace with the rising cost of living, fuel prices and motorcycle maintenance costs, leading to financial difficulties for PHIs, the union claims. “To express their grievances, the association is to engage in trade union action,” the Union head added. However, selected health institutions, such as the port, airport, blood bank, maternity hospitals, children’s hospital, the kidney units and training activities will not be hampered owing to the strike action, he added."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/23/cabinet-will-reject-water-tariff-hike-proposal-amaraweera/,Cabinet will reject water tariff hike proposal – Amaraweera,Author not found,0,2023-10-22T20:34:00+00:00,"Since there is no need to increase the water tariff at this juncture, Cabinet will not approve such a proposal, Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera said. The Government admits that the increase in electricity tariffs was difficult for the public to bear at this time. But due to the current state of war between several countries, the price of imported materials has increased. Therefore, the Minister of Agriculture said it is regrettable that the public have to pay increase electricity tariffs due to this unfortunate situation. He however added that there was no need to increase the water tariff at this point of time. Therefore, the Minister also said if such a proposal is put forward to Cabinet, it will be rejected. Minister Amaraweera was speaking, while participating in a programme held in Agunakolapelassa recently, to distribute free maize needed for maize cultivation for the Maha season to farmers of the Hambantota district. Through the Small Scale Agribusiness Participation Programme (SAPP) under the Ministry of Agriculture, it has been decided to cultivate 40,000 acres of maize in the three districts of Anuradhapura, Moneragala and Hambantota this season. Steps have been taken to distribute the necessary maize seeds and urea fertiliser to farmers free of charge Rs 350 million is expected to be spent in this connection. The Minister said, “The war situation affecting the world has also affected our country. There is a story that rich countries get colds while the poor countries suffer from pneumonia. Similarly, due to the war between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Palestine, there is a danger that the price of imported goods too will increase.” “There were reports in the media that water bills would go up. But I say there is no need to increase water bills at this time. Therefore, if such a proposal is submitted to Cabinet, it will not be approved. The only option to get out of this predicament is for us to work together. If we work separately for political gain, it will only make us fall further into the abyss,” he added. “Increasing electricity tariffs is not a good thing. But in our country, most of the electricity is still produced by thermal power. Even though many areas have received rain these days, the hydropower plants have not yet started generating 100 per cent hydropower,” he added. “The CEB must also make some sacrifices. It is not reasonable to demand that only the public should make sacrifices all the time,” he further added. Therefore, he said everyone must work together to overcome these difficulties."

The National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection (NMCRP) pointed out that consumers who used 180 units in 2022 paid a monthly bill of Rs 3,755 but were now compelled to pay around Rs 10,500 following two tariff increases this year and this is three times that of the tariff they paid before the revision. They have thus have made a plea to take their plight into consideration and give them a concessionary period of more than 40 days, beginning from the date on which they have to settle their bills. At a time when the country is experiencing a severe economic downturn and pushing the ordinary people into untold hardship paying a large sum of money at once remains a difficult task for these people, NMCRP’s Ranjith Withanage pointed out. Meanwhile, the CEB has issued red notices to 253,465 consumers who failed to pay the electricity tariff for January 2022 and there is an increase of 60 per cent in the issuing of red notices, which goes to show that the people were struggling to pay their electricity bills, the NMCRP said. Though the electricity tariff was increased, the CEB had not given consumers any concessionary period to settle their bills. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

They sent these requests to both the Road Development Authority (RDA) and the relevant contractor company, 200 each. The purpose was to request information, including the damage assessment reports for their houses and related financial assessments, within 48 hours. The RTI requests sent to the RDA contain 18 questions, while those sent to the contractor company contain 16 questions. Sanjeewa Kulathilaka, a victim and activist of the Association of Victimised Families from the construction of Central Expressway, said over 400 houses were damaged during the construction of the Central Expressway, specifically the last stretch from Mirigama to Kurunegala. Some victims have not been compensated, while others received inadequate compensation, as low as Rs 5,000 or 10,000 for seriously damaged houses. Due to continuous complaints to the RDA, the Police and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) falling on deaf ears, the people submitted 400 RTI requests under the Right to Information Act, he said. According to Section 25 (3) of the Right to Information Act, organisations must respond within 48 hours to requests related to citizens’ lives or personal freedom. Since some houses have further deteriorated due to rain, with cracks widening and walls at risk of collapsing, the RTI requests were filed under this particular section, Kulathilaka said. Meanwhile, an appeal related to Kulathilaka’s previous RTI request is scheduled at the Right to Information Commission as well. If no information is received within 48 hours regarding the 400 RTI requests, the residents plan to appeal to the designated officer, and if necessary, to the RTI Commission. Further, a hearing concerning an earlier complaint made by Kulathilaka to the HRCSL in 2020 is scheduled for 3 November. Additionally, a special team from the Ministry of Transport is set to visit Kurunegala tomorrow (24) to investigate a complaint by Kulathilaka. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

On the direction of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, a discussion was held with all relevant parties and stakeholders last week, under the chairmanship of Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake and thus, the formulation of the relevant policy has been assigned to the Ministry of Finance. It has also been suggested in the discussion to remove the Rs 5,000 cess presently imposed on a kg of imported beedi leaves. In addition to the cess, the Government also collects an amount of Rs 2 from each beedi stick produced. Even though the Excise Department has introduced this system, it was disclosed during this discussion that this system has not been implemented properly. Concerns were also raised at the discussion, claiming that due to the cess levied per kg of beedi leaves, a large number of beedi leaves are being smuggled into the country. Therefore, Ratnayake hopes that streamlining the beedi industry will help to streamline the activities of the Excise Department of Sri Lanka as well.  Since about 700 people are presently engaged in the beedi industry, it has been decided to remove the cess charged on imports of beedi leaves and instead increase the tax amount charged on one beedi stick, from Rs 2 to Rs 3.50. This decision has been taken so that even if the rest of the tax is removed, the income will not decrease in any way. The now revised set of policies will be further discussed with Minister of Finance, President Ranil Wickremesinghe prior to implementation. By Buwanaka S. Perera"

Also, the party will have a High Posts Committee which will be responsible for deciding on tactics. “The UNP will become a digital political party with the introduction of digital groups. Any member of the party can form digital groups after obtaining approval from the party hierarchy. Digital groups can come up at constituency level, district level and at the national level,” Wickremesinghe added. “New leaders should be ready to take over the party before long,” the party leader stressed further."

Further, local government elections are expected in the first half of 2025. The President was speaking at the Special General Convention of the UNP held at Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on Saturday (21). “Both the presidential election and the general election will be held next year while the provincial council election will be held in early 2025,” the President said. “Around 50 per cent of the voting population in the country reject all political parties. They want a new political culture. I will be appointing a commission headed by retired Chief Justice Priyasath Dep to look into political parties. There are a large number of political parties in the country. No one knows who leads them. The new commission will look into the details of the parties. Some parties are influenced by persons who offer them large sums of money. The commission will probe all these and make recommendations regarding parties in six weeks. I would like to know the stand of political parties on this move,” he said. “We will also work towards building a smart country. I will announce plans for building a smart nation in the Budget Speech next month. I accepted the presidency to revive the economy. We have taken measures in this regard. The county has become stable once again. The Cabinet which comprises SLPP members have supported me in this endeavour. Also, Opposition MPs like Harsha de Silva and Patali Champika Ranawaka support me through their acts as chairpersons of two parliamentary committees,” he added."

The incident took place at around 7.30 p.m. in Ahungalla. A 32-year-old local businessman, residing in the Galvehara area and his wife aged 27 were travelling home with their four-month-old infant when an unidentified group hiding in a cinnamon plantation, by the Uragaha Road in Ahungalla, opened fire at the vehicle. Despite the 32-year-old driver being shot in the mouth and the infant being shot in the foot, the couple had continued the journey home and later on was admitted to the Balapitiya Base Hospital. Even though the injured are not in a critical condition, due to the severity of the injuries the father and the infant were later admitted to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital. Speaking to Ceylon Today Police Media Spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa said that the law enforcement agencies have observed an increase in gang related violence in the area in the past few years and that their networks have extended considerably.  This incident could possibly be related to a conflict between organised criminal gangs. SSP Thalduwa further said even though the victim has no affiliation to acriminal gang, he is related to some such persons and so the motive behind the shooting could possibly be a revenge attack from an opposing gang. This, he said is how orgaised criminal gangs operate. Ahungalla Police is conducting further investigations into the incident. By Buwanaka S. Perera"

The accused, identified as Mohamed Imran Khan (39) alias Haja Najerbheeden, a native of Ramanathpuram, was secured from his hideout in Theni district by the absconder tracker team (ATT) of the NIA from Bengaluru. The NIA said it had been tracking his movements for a few months. The NIA said Mohamed Imran Khan was a smuggler and fugitive wanted by several investigation agencies. “He, along with a Sri Lankan national named Eesan, formerly associated with the LTTE devised a plan to illegally transport 61 Sri Lankan nationals from the island to various locations in Tamil Nadu. They lured these individuals with false promises, including the prospect of obtaining legitimate documentation for emigration to Canada and securing employment,” said the NIA. NIA registered a case in 2021 after the Tamil Nadu Police’s Q branch secured 23 Sri Lankan nationals and four agents in Madurai, which led to the detention of another 38 Sri Lankan nationals in Mangaluru. So far, the NIA has arrested 13 suspects in the case and filed a charge sheet against five named Dhinakaran alias Ayya, Kasi Viswanathan, Rasool, Satham Ushen and Abdul Muheetu. “Investigations revealed that Imran Khan played a pivotal role in a broader conspiracy involving international human trafficking. He acted as the main conduit responsible for transporting Sri Lankan nationals from their home country to India and subsequently to other nations,” said the NIA. (ToI)"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/21/caring-for-kanneliya/,Caring for Kanneliya,Author not found,0,2023-10-20T20:32:00+00:00," Richer in biodiversity than the famous Sinharaja rainforest – according to a National Conservation Review (NCR) done in 1997 – Kanneliya has gained popularity over the years due to its numerous varieties of animals and plants; some of which are found only in this jungle.     The forest complex was designated as a biosphere reserve in 2004 by UNESCO and is the last large remaining rainforest in the country other than Sinharaja. The Kanneliya rainforest is home to more than a 100 species of animals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and butterflies and has over the years remained undisturbed. The area is covered by a natural high-forest ecosystem consisting of several forest types, mainly lowland tropical forest, wet semi-evergreen forest, sub-montane tropical wet semi-evergreen forest, and montane tropical wet-evergreen forest. Kanneliya, Dediyagala, and Nakiyadeniya (KDN) forest reserves are located in the south-western part of Sri Lanka, east of Galle. The KDN complex of forests occupies the area between two rivers, the Gin River and the Nilwala River and consists of a series of ridges and valleys. Over 17 per cent of the wet zone flora is confined to this area where the KDN forests are the most prominent. This region has been identified as floristically one of the richest areas in South Asia.  However in recent times, Kanneliya has lost some of its prime biodiversity but a project initiated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), ‘Restoration of a Degraded Rainforest in a Highly Biodiversity Area in Kanneliya Rainforest (Life Project)’ that commenced in 2018 has finally seen an improvement in the lost biodiversity of Kanneliya. “To develop biodiversity credit accrual system the Forest Department tried to restore this area 40 years back with Eucalyptus. However that project has failed leaving behind a few stunted Eucalyptus trees. Biodiversity Sri Lanka developed a project with the technical assistance of IUCN to restore this degraded land. IUCN implemented the restoration programme in collaboration with the Forest Department and Biodiversity Sri Lanka,” Senior Programme Officer at IUCN, Naalin Perera explained.  “We are in the halfway stage. We developed the methodology in 2017, started in 2018, continued until 2023. We did a survey and identified the species in the rainforest. We selected the plant species in order to match the species in the rainforest.  We have to directly introduce the plant species because the rainforest species are very sensitive,” Perera explained. The site selected for the restoration project by those involved can be described as a degraded rainforest. “The site has been cleared for cultivation and abandoned subsequently resulting in the area being colonised by the pioneer fern species Dicranopteris linearis (Kekeilla). The site has remained in this degraded condition for many decades,” Perera said. Overall aim of the project is to restore highly degraded rainforest using principles of restoration ecology to enhance its ecological functions, habitat quality, species diversity and its capacity to provide biodiversity and ecosystem services that is in close approximation to what has prevailed there before it has been converted to its present state. In the first few years they had to work with the species that tolerated the degraded conditions. Later on when there was a satisfactory shade, other rainforest species were gradually introduced. Based on the progress achieved through the adaptive approaches introduced in the second and third years, an intensive planting methodology was developed to restore heavily degraded rainforest area which was invaded by Kekeilla. The project work included; the removal of Kekilla vegetation, facilitating the natural regeneration of native species (Veraniya/Mahabovitiya) and increasing the planting pit size, application of organic and selected inorganic fertilisers, introduction of soil conservation and improvement methods, introduction of plant protection methodologies, maintaining soil moisture in dry season, watering and introduction of Nitrogen-fixing native herb (legume) species, the introduction of pioneer and shade plants, and using local knowledge on seed collection, germination and plant protection and land preparation. The project wasn’t without its hardships such as heavy rain and/or prolonged drought interrupting the progress, slow growth of plants due to poor soil condition, and plant destruction due to large and small herbivores intrusion. The success of any ecological restoration depends heavily on planning. Yet there can be many unexpected challenges. Monitoring is a critical need as ecological restoration takes time. Progress is not linear but exponential. Among the rich biodiversity are endemic freshwater fish species that can be found from the Kanneliya streams. The Gin Ganga, Udugam Ela and Kanneliya Ela are the most popular and suitable places for spotting ground water fishes in the Kanneliya Forest Reserve. Kanneliya consists of Hora trees and other important tree species. There is a high proportion of endemism among the identified woody plants. Numerous medicinal plants such as Weniwelgata (Concinium fenestratum), Kothala Himbutu (Salacia reticulate), and Rasakinda (Tinospora cordifoli), Kuda Hadaya (Lycopodium Squarrosum), and Maha Hadaya (Lycopodium phlegmaria) are among the rare plants the forest complex harbours.   Sri Lanka has a variety of endemic lobsters and endemic bird species; some of which are found in Kanneliya Forest Reserve. The forest is home to the leopards, wild boar, pangolin, meeminna, porcupine, fishing cat, Southern Purple-faced Leaf Monkey, geckos, butterflies, snakes, mammals, lizards, many other endemic reptiles, and amphibians, and a variety of flora.        There are around 78 villages surrounding the KDN forests. According to historical records the Nugegoda, Rajagala and Dediyagala hermitages are also situated within this forest. “IUCN was initially involved and then we worked with the Forest Department and with the local community. This is one of the best partnership projects. It is the Private, Public and People (PPP) participation project. Biodiversity Sri Lanka funded the project. We can’t stop this now. We have to continue, if not it can revert back. Rainforests are very tall and layered. We can see the rainforest is growing there,” Perera explained. By Risidra Mendis"

Minister Alles explained that he had to table the answers as the given time for answering the questions had expired due to the heated verbal exchange over the service extension of the Inspector General of Police (IGP). The Opposition strongly opposed this decision, demanding that the Minister answer the questions. A group of MPs, including Mannapperuma, then approached the Well and began protesting. During this commotion, Mannapperuma approached the Mace, insinuating that he might move it. The escalating tensions led to the Speaker suspending the sittings for 10 minutes.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Chanaka stressed that there is no threat of a fuel shortage and emphasised that the necessary tenders, for fuel import up to June 2024, have been completed, ensuring an uninterrupted fuel supply until that time. He also highlighted that by entrusting the supply of fuel to Sinopec Company of China, the Government expects to save more than USD 500 million in foreign exchange. State Minister Chanaka made these statements during a press briefing held yesterday (19), at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) under the theme ‘Collective Path to a Stable Country’. The State Minister further said, “Recently, our country faced a significant fuel crisis, with fuel shortages and long queues at gas stations. However, we successfully resolved this situation within a short period. When considering the month of January 2022, it’s worth noting that crude oil prices in the world market were relatively low, with a barrel of crude oil priced at USD 50. In the following months, it increased to USD 65 and later, due to various factors including the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, it reached USD 100 per barrel. Subsequently, it decreased to USD 80. This year, after a year-and-a-half of gradual increases, the price of crude oil has slightly decreased. Especially, in the first six days of this month, the world market saw a decrease of about 4% in crude oil prices. However, recent events in the Gaza Strip caused a 4% increase in fuel prices globally, nullifying the relief we expected from falling crude oil prices. Though Israel and Palestine aren’t significant fuel producers or distributors in the world market, Iran’s potential involvement in the situation adds to the uncertainty in the global market. Despite the conflict in the Gaza Strip, Sri Lanka’s fuel imports have not been disrupted. Tenders for fuel supply have been awarded up to June of next year, ensuring a steady supply of fuel in the country. Nevertheless, some uncertainties persist. In addition, we have allowed three other suppliers, including China’s Sinopec, to provide fuel to our country. Sinopec has already commenced operations in Sri Lanka, resulting in savings of approximately USD 40 million in foreign exchange per season. It is anticipated that these measures will contribute to saving over USD 500 million in foreign exchange annually. Furthermore, these actions have helped reduce the risk to the dollar reserves maintained by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and efforts are being made to pass on these benefits to consumers. Notably, we have established a reserve of USD 200 million for oil purchases for the first time.” (GW)"

In all the 10,135 schools we have a 4.1 million student population in Primary, Junior Secondary and Senior Secondary grades. “In the Primary sections, we have a 1.6 million student population. At the moment, the Government is committed, through the yearly National Budget, to allocate USD 61 million to provide one million students with a midday meal. We are planning to increase the number up to 1.6 million students, covering all primary students by 2024. And by 2030, we hope to cover all 4.1 million public school students, by increasing the Budget allocation to USD 204 million,” the Minister explained.  He further said, at the moment, the Government is being supported by the World Food Programme, USAID and the corporate sector of the country and some NGOs to carry out the midday meal programme. Minister Premajayantha, addressing the Global Summit, elaborated that a salient feature in Sri Lanka for the past 76 years is that from Grade one to the First Degree, the education is free. “We distribute free text books from Grade one to 12, and we also provide free uniform materials for all 4.1 million students.” He emphasised that amidst all its constraints, the Government is still committed to providing midday meals to students. “We have a health policy for students, because in Sri Lanka, our education administrative structure is parallel to the Health M inistry structure. So, at the provincial level, divisional and regional levels, we have a system to coordinate between health authorities and educational authorities. “Every year, for primary students, we have health screening, where we measure their height, their weight and we know exactly what the vulnerable areas are and where we need to pay more attention. “We are going forward with these and the Government is committed to continue providing these. “In Sri Lanka, the literacy rate is 93%. The enrolment to Grade one by the completion of five years of age is almost 99%. Except for the students who need special education, all other students get enrolled to schools at the age of five. And, the primary completion rate is also the same. Only at the Ordinary Level stage you find a three to five per cent dropout rate.”"

AHP President, Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (19) said that to have only a group of medical doctors in Parliament “uniting to resolve the issues in the State health service” was merely way of hoodwinking the masses. It would only help safeguard themselves rather than safeguarding public interest. Rather than changing the system and protecting the people, they would only save their own species, he said alleging that the problem in the State Health Care System had been created by poor management, and the lack of decision-making. All fraud and corruption were legitimised through the system. While 99% of the Health Service comprised medical practitioners “we cannot expect the doctors who are politicians to do anything to protect the service, Kumudesh lamented The AHP President urged the group of parliamentarians to gather people who could think in a modern way and who had mastered management methods. Those who know information technology and have good management skills and experience should be given the opportunity, he said.  Kumudesh noted that the Health system had not failed due to Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, but due to the officials and companies that were corrupt. The procurement system itself encourages people to steal, cheat, bribe, and take commissions, he alleged.  The AHP President held former officials and former ministers for the corruption in the State health service.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Sri Lanka has been pushing to agree terms for restructuring debt owed to China, India, Paris Club and foreign bondholders to bring indebtedness down to levels the IMF finds acceptable. After concluding domestic debt restructuring and agreeing tentative terms with China Exim Bank, the focus is now on how much progress the nation can make in talks with other official creditors, as well as bondholders who submitted a proposal that included a 20 per cent haircut and new “macro-linked bonds” last week. On the bondholder proposal, Sri Lanka’s adviser Lazard “will look at it and evaluate comparability,” said Semasinghe. Discussions with China continue, “and our principle will be to be transparent and it will be comparable,” while negotiations with the official creditor committee are also ongoing, he said.

The report reveals that out of the 71 trackable commitments due for completion by the end of September 2023, Sri Lanka has successfully fulfilled only 40. What’s more concerning is that the country has reached its lowest point in terms of both performance and transparency since the programme began in March. This decline is attributed to approximately 30% of the commitments scheduled for completion by the end of September having an unknown status, while three of the four commitments mandating increased governmental transparency were left unmet, Verité Research in a statement said. This situation exposes a concerning ‘twin deficit in transparency’: the growth of opacity in the programme’s progress and the failure to meet IMF commitments calling for enhanced government transparency. The report indicated that the number of commitments with unknown statuses has spiked to an all-time high of approximately 30%, compared to around 20% in August. This growing lack of transparency poses a risk of eroding public and institutional confidence, both in Sri Lanka’s economic progress and the effectiveness of the IMF programme itself. Furthermore, the statement said over the seven months following the board-level agreement, most requirements stipulating transparency have gone unfulfilled. For instance, the commitment to “Report monthly cash flows from revenues, expenditures, and financing by the third business day of the subsequent month by the Department of State Accounts” remains unmet. Another example is the creation of an online fiscal transparency platform, which was due in March but still hasn’t been implemented. “Sri Lanka’s accountability issues, as highlighted by the two governance diagnostics, are foundational to public accountability in a democratic system. The assessments suggest that the twin transparency deficit could be a leading indicator that the anticipated economic recovery may not materialise as expected,” the statement added."

Agricultural experts at the Department of Agriculture have successfully conducted research to identify two pomegranate varieties that are well-suited for cultivation in Sri Lanka. These new varieties have been successfully cultivated in Norochcholai, demonstrating high yields and promising income prospects for local farmers. Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera personally visited the pomegranate cultivation in Norochcholai on 16 October. He said cultivating pomegranates on just half an acre of land can yield an income of approximately Rs 6 million. Moreover, pomegranate trees have a remarkable lifespan of about 30 years. Currently, ongoing field research aims to identify suitable areas for the cultivation of these two new pomegranate varieties. Director General of Agriculture Malathi Parasuraman, informed the Minister that the recommendation for these new varieties will be presented to the Crop Release Committee of the Department of Agriculture in the coming month. These two pomegranate varieties are yet to be officially named, and their nomenclature will be determined upon the recommendation of the Crop Release Committee. Both varieties are known for their sweetness and appealing colour, making them attractive to consumers. Notably, each tree can produce a harvest of approximately 10 kg of pomegranates at a time, and they bear fruit throughout the year. Minister Amaraweera expressed his commitment to fast-tracking the release of these two new pomegranate varieties for cultivation in Sri Lanka. He highlighted that the country spends about Rs 900 million annually on pomegranate imports, primarily from India and other nations. The introduction of these two new, locally cultivable pomegranate varieties aims to reduce the need for imports and further strengthen Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector. Given the high international demand for pomegranates, Norochcholai is deemed highly suitable for pomegranate cultivation, and the private sector has already begun cultivation in this region. Minister Amaraweera praised the success of Sri Lankan agricultural scientists and confirmed that suitable cultivation areas for these new pomegranate varieties will be identified in the first quarter of the upcoming year, enabling local farmers to partake in their cultivation.

This special convention will be held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on 21 October, presided over by Party Leader, President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Passing the OSB is a critical initiative introduced by the Government,” Ratnapriya said.

It is speculated around 200 persons were missing during the Hamas raid in Israel. Ambassador Bandara told Ceylon Today that her death has been confirmed. Anula was a caretaker who had worked near the Gaza border for over a decade. “She was kidnapped and killed by Hamas,” the Israeli Government has informed the Ambassador. “The family in Kelaniya has been officially notified about the tragic passing of their mother, a mother of two children.” The son, who resides in New Zealand, was also contacted by the Ambassador to confirm the death of his mother. “It’s a day marked by sadness, and despite my desire to hope for a different outcome, I had considered travelling to the Gaza area to inspect hospitals to ascertain her condition. However, I was not permitted to travel due to safety risks. I continued to inquire about the two missing individuals and ultimately received the confirmation of Anula’s unfortunate death,” Bandara said. The Ambassador stated that he is seeking information about the whereabouts of 44-year-old Yatawara Bandara from Wennappuwa who is also missing from the time of the attack.   Anula had been the sole breadwinner, caring for an elderly Israeli family member. According to the Ambassador, the Israeli family identified Anula’s body and expressed their deep sorrow and also appreciated her devoted work. The family, residing in another location, had relied on Anula to care for their elderly mother near the Gaza Strip. The Government will repatriate Anula’s body to Sri Lanka and provide compensation to her family, the Ambassador said. He also stated that, despite a temporary ban, there is no permanent prohibition on workers from Sri Lanka coming to work in Israel. Many individuals express an interest in working in Israel, and opportunities were available. Several countries, including India, Japan, Australia, and China, have successfully evacuated their citizens living and studying in Israel. Bandara said while there is a ban on workers entering Israel, it is not being rigorously enforced, and many people are still trying to come to Israel.  The Israeli government had invited all diplomats stationed in Israel for a briefing on the war situation at the Knesset in Jerusalem on 16 October, Bandara said.

The Speaker made this statement in response to MP Chandima Weerakkody, who raised concerns related to his matter of privilege, asserting the need for access to the audio tape to address threats made against him during a recent Parliamentary Committee meeting. Weerakkody, who raised a Matter of Privilege in Parliament on 6 October, alleged that he was threatened by Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne and the Army Commander over his remarks about excessive vehicle usage by high-ranking military officials, on 5 October, during the meeting of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security. At this juncture, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella, addressing the issue, highlighted that threatening an MP constitutes a breach of parliamentary privileges. Kiriella stressed that the Speaker has a duty to safeguard the privileges of MPs and requested the release of the audio tape, further questioning whether the Speaker condoned the alleged threats made against Weerakkody. In response, the Speaker clarified that the audio tape could be presented and examined within the Privileges Committee. Weerakkody indicated his intention to pursue legal action concerning the alleged threats. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

Prof. Dangalla stated that the second surgery on the tusker had been done based on a Court order due to the weakening condition of the animal and to save its life. The owner of the tusker S.M. Roshan said claims made by officers of the Department of Wildlife Conservation that the tusker had been shot at with rubber bullets proved to be false due to the removal of aforementioned items from its body during the recent surgery.

During their bilateral discussions, both leaders stressed the global imperative of fostering a harmonious society that transcends animosity, prejudice, and anger stemming from racial, religious, or ethnic differences. They emphasised the importance of addressing the challenge of creating a unified society founded on shared humanity, where divisions driven by race, religion, or ethnicity give way to unity and mutual understanding.

As the world celebrates International Rural Women’s Day on 15 October each year, the day shines a spotlight and recognises the significant contributions of women to global development.  To recognise the vital contribution of rural women in Sri Lanka, a commemorative event took place in Polonnaruwa yesterday with over 300 women across seven districts and the participation of high-level representatives including; Roshan Ranasinghe, Minister of Irrigation and Sports; Anupa Pasqual, State Minister of Social Empowerment; Mizukoshi Hideaki, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka; Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP in Sri Lanka; along with representatives from local government and civil society organisations. Speaking at the event, Minister Ranasinghe, said, “I appreciate the efforts taken to celebrate Rural Women’s Day here in Polonnaruwa, a testament to their resilience to hardships and challenges faced over the years…We acknowledge the grant support provided by the Government of Japan and other stakeholders through these UNDP-led interventions, to support and empower these communities.” Commenting on the importance of the day, State Minister Pasqual, stated, “Recognising rural women on a commemorative day such as today, not only empowers women, but supports to build and rebuild strong sustainable women’s networks… I encourage all present here today to commit yourselves, as you have been equipped with the right skills to journey on this new path.” The special event saw the opening of the Gal Oya Green Zone, handing over the poultry feed production centre to the Gal Oya Green Women’s Society, and awarding membership to the Rural Women’s Business Forum, among other activities. These efforts are a result of UNDP-led interventions in the field, through the Green Climate Fund (GCF) financed ‘Climate Resilient Integrated Water Management Project (CRIWMP)’, the Japanese Supplementary Budget (JSB) funded ‘Strengthening Smallholder Farmers and Micro/Home-Based Agriculture Industries for  Enhanced Food and Livelihood Security’ project, and financing from the Government of Luxemburg through UNDP’s Funding Windows supported intervention to create an integrated social protection system for long-term inclusive growth and broad-based resilience. Noting the Government of Japan’s priority in strengthening such interventions in Sri Lanka, Japanese Ambassador Hideaki, stated, “I believe these interventions will provide practical means to uplift lives of vulnerable communities with a focus on women’s economic empowerment and enhance the capacity, promoting their productivity and sustainability, which will contribute to the economic recovery of Sri Lanka. The Government of Japan is committed to support the lives of rural women through numerous projects and initiatives.” Through UNDP’s integrated support through the Funding Windows, the Gal Oya Green Zone encompasses a roadside marketplace with 20 eco-friendly sales huts along a kilometre stretch of the Habarana – Trincomalee Road, benefiting 40 women in the area, enabling the sale of ecologically grown home garden agricultural products. In addition, 110 home gardens have been established under the Green Climate Funded CRIWMP and Japanese Supplementary Budget (JSB) supported projects, enhancing nutritional levels, increasing food security among farming families, and creating livelihood opportunities to sell surplus produce at the roadside market. Commenting on UNDP’s role, UNDP Resident Representative, Kubota, highlighted, “From the rising cost of living and food insecurity, women have disproportionally felt the brunt of the compounding crises. Our joint initiatives with the Government of Sri Lanka, generously funded by the Government of Japan, equipped women with livelihood skills and tools to enhance their resilience against these shocks. The women have applied their own indigenous knowledge and innovation to augment the impact of these investments and we clearly see the exponential effect. At UNDP, we are firmly committed to working with women, particularly in rural areas, at this time of difficulty as they can truly be agents of change for the families and communities, and the country as a whole.” Through gender equitable agriculture programmes such as backyard poultry, climate-smart rainwater harvesting and drinking water supply in the Dry Zone to ease the care work burden, quick grant schemes for agro-based enterprises and crop cultivation, engagement of women in micro irrigation systems and water management, Rural Women’s Day is an opportunity to recognise the work of these heroines in the food systems of the world and in Sri Lanka, while striving to create more equitable and sustainable opportunities for all."

He added that many patriots have now emerged in the country and suggested that if they indeed are patriots, they should extend a helping hand to rebuild the nation without insisting on immediate elections. He also expressed concern about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, which he believes will significantly impact the global economy, particularly the oil market, alongside the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. He stressed that the most severe repercussions would be felt by Sri Lanka, as well as other countries worldwide. Nanayakkara pointed out that certain factions are mistakenly hoping that the ongoing conflict between Palestine and Israel will lead to the collapse of Sri Lanka’s economy, which they intend to exploit for political gain. He criticised politically motivated politicians for attempting to manipulate the emotions and poverty of ordinary people as pawns on their political chessboard to achieve their goals. “At a time when the country is grappling with a severe economic crisis, the primary concern of the people is to meet their basic needs, not to rush into an election. As a responsible political party attuned to the needs of the people, we are focused on restoring those affected by the crisis to normalcy, rather than prioritising immediate elections as a way out of the ongoing tragic situation,” Nanayakkara added.

GRTA President accused the Health Ministry of wasting public funds by abandoning recruitment of trained professionals. He accused the Health Ministry of shirking its responsibility by allowing the country’s hospital system to collapse. Dharmawickrema said that steps should at least be taken to provide the relevant internship training to those awaiting PSM jobs and send them for foreign employment so that the country could at least receive foreign exchange as there was a demand overseas for such categories.

The CEB had sought a substantial tariff increase of approximately 22 per cent. The CEB has been instructed to submit a revised tariff proposal on or before Wednesday (18). The CEB, in late September, made a request to the PUCSL for an interim tariff increase, citing two key reasons, which are, the unexpected lower rainfall levels up to August, increased costs incurred as a result of coal plant outages. The lower rainfall was the basis for the previous tariff adjustment, as cited by the CEB. The CEB explained that the dry weather conditions upon which the last tariff revision was predicated had materialised in practice. Furthermore, the anticipated generation of 4,500 GigaWatt hours of hydro energy, which had prompted a larger tariff reduction by the regulator, was no longer likely, even with higher levels of rainfall experienced in the last quarter. The PUCSL, in a letter to the CEB General Manager, on 13 October, pointed out that the CEB’s predictions for a recovery in electricity demand were lower than the actual figures for both September and October. Furthermore, there was a greater accumulation of hydroelectric storage than originally projected, thanks to recent rains. Additionally, coal prices in rupees were observed to be lower than initially estimated. Notably, the cost of coal had decreased from 68.4 rupees per kilogram in a submission dated 15 May to Rs 52.6 in a subsequent submission, as indicated by the PUCSL. This reduction in coal prices did not align with the decrease in coal power generation. Furthermore, the PUCSL said the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) maintained the stability of the LKR at around 323.50 against the USD, primarily through a consistent and accommodating monetary policy. Furthermore, global energy prices were steadying, partially due to a more restrained Federal Reserve policy. While there was a recent conflict between Israel and Hamas, that temporarily increased oil prices, they were also stabilising. In the letter, the PUCSL had adjusted coal generation figures from an earlier 1,444 GigaWatt hours to 1,334 GigaWatt hours. However, the commission anticipates a decline in electricity demand that would surpass the reduction in coal power generation. (MD)"

He mentioned this during a recent event held in Anuradhapura. He added, “Currently there are around 430 SOEs. Some of these projects show profit while others are incurring losses. Last year alone the Government spent some Rs 1.5 trillion to operate these SOEs, but, if that money had been invested in a private sector the Government should have gained more revenue. “Already, the Treasury has been forced to incur heavy costs to sustain SOEs that do not provide tangible returns. These monies could otherwise be utilised for welfare programmes of the public and development work. Therefore, the Government has taken a policy decision not to start any SOE in the foreseeable future.” The State Minister added that all loss-making SOEs will be restructured in the coming months.

The Neurosurgery Unit, at Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, recently conducted this successful brain surgery to remove a brain tumor. This procedure, known as an ‘awake craniotomy’, involves operating on the brain while the patient is awake, allowing communication with the surgical team and voluntary movements. Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital achieved another milestone as this was the first awake brain surgery ever conducted in a State hospital in Sri Lanka. The surgery focused on resecting a tumor located in the patient’s left frontal lobe. The patient remained under minimal sedation without the use of general anesthesia. The patient, a 36-year-old sculptor, created a drawing, during the surgery, to assist the medical team in preserving areas of the brain responsible for speech, motor function, and sensory perception as they removed the tumor. Following the successful procedure, the patient, a resident of Nochchiyagama, was discharged from the hospital without any complications. The surgery was carried out by a dedicated medical team, including Dr. Madushanka Gomez and Dr. Rohan Paris, neurosurgeons at Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, as well as anesthesiologists Dr. Levan Kariyawasam and Dr. Vishakha Kerner.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Currently, the sour banana project spans 200 acres, while the mango project encompasses 500 acres. The sour banana and TEJC mango plantations in Jaffna have been established with the goal of exportation. Presently, 10,000 kg of sour bananas are exported to the Dubai market weekly in collaboration with the Rajangana Sour Banana Project. On 15 October Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera visited the Jaffna area to assess the progress of these two projects. Member of Parliament Angajan Ramanathan joined him. Under the TEJC Mango Project, 500 acres of TEJC mangoes are cultivated in the Elutumattuwal area of Chavakachcheri. Additionally, 200 acres of sour bananas have been planted in the Jaffna agricultural region, along with the establishment of a sour banana processing center in Nilavarei. After inspecting these two projects, the minister remarked: “These projects, launched under the Agricultural Sector Modernisation Project, have been very successful. We have decided to further expand these initiatives. Especially through high-density cultivation methods, we aim to maximise yields from the available land.” The minister also noted that paddy cultivation in Jaffna does not yield significant harvests, with an average yield of two metric tons per hectare. Consequently, farmers do not receive adequate income from this crop. As a result, there is a need for new crops and cultivation methods. “We are prepared to provide new cultivation techniques, technology, and all necessary resources to those interested in diversifying into alternative crops.” Both the mango and sour banana projects have become valuable contributors to the country’s economy, generating foreign exchange. The cultivation and processing of agricultural products adhere to the highest standards. Sour banana cultivation in Jaffna is expanding by an additional 400 acres, while the TEJC mango project’s current acreage is deemed sufficient. A substantial mango harvest is anticipated in the near future. Therefore, efforts will be made to maintain market demand for these mangoes. In this regard, the minister emphasised that new mango plantations beyond the current projects should not be promoted. Instead, the Ministry is actively encouraging farmers to explore other exportable crops. BY Hansi Nanayakkara"

President Ranil Wickremesinghe will preside. However, due to the adverse weather conditions, the initial plan to accommodate 24,000 participants has been scaled down to avoid potential inconveniences for party supporters. He said that several historically significant decisions will be made during the convention. These include amendments to the party’s constitution, aimed at transforming the UNP into a more formidable force by addressing past issues. While addressing the media at Sirikotha, the UNP General Secretary explained that in January 2021, President Ranil Wickremesinghe took action to appoint a new working committee for the party. This move came after members who were part of the UNP’s working committee formed a new party following the historic defeat in the 2020 General Election. He stated that in alignment with the aspirations of last year’s Aragalaya, the UNP is prepared to support a system change that the country currently needs to overcome its challenges. He further mentioned that the party’s new constitution will be designed to adapt to the ever-evolving geopolitical landscape and contribute to achieving the sustainable development goals set by President Wickremesinghe for Sri Lanka’s 100th Independence Day in 2048.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Priyangika said. According to the Divisional Secretary, this step was taken on the recommendations of the National Building Research Organisasion (NBRO). Some 778 people were evacuated amidst heavy rains. A total of 144 families living on both sides of the Meeriyabedda old landslide site were evacuated. They were relocated to the Koslanda tea factory, while an additional 23 families from the Mahakanda Grama Niladhari Division were moved to the Malvanna tea factory. One family from the Dimbulgasmulla was evacuated to the Koslanda Tamil Vidyalaya. Evacuation efforts were conducted by the Army, disaster relief officers from the Haldummulla Divisional Secretariat and Forest Department officers. These measures were essential also due to the looming threat of encounters with elephants in the nearby forest. The decision to evacuate residents was prompted by a significant and sudden increase in rainfall within a short period, after several years.  Signs of potential landslides in Miriyabedda and surrounding areas heightened concerns for the safety of the local population, the Divisional Secretary said. In addition to the landslide risks, the heavy rain has also created challenges for road safety. Roads between Beragala and Haputale as well as the Beragala- Wellawaya Road and Ella – Wellawaya Road, are susceptible to rock-falls from the mountains. The Bandarawela Police Superintendent’s Office has issued a warning, urging drivers to exercise caution when travelling on these sections of the road. Meanwhile, due to the risk of landslides in Koslanda, ​​Haldummulla three schools are closed today (16). Further, principals of 144 schools in the Bandarawela Zonal Education Division have been informed that prior to re-opening schools today (16), they should ensure that there are no risks related to weather conditions.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement on its website, revealing the grim toll inflicted on journalists during the first eight days of the conflict. As of 14 October, the CPJ documented that a dozen journalists had lost their lives while reporting from the region, with two individuals still unaccounted for and eight sustaining injuries. The conflict has taken a devastating toll on both sides, with The Associated Press reporting more than 3,000 fatalities. The prospect of further casualties looms large as Israel prepares for an imminent ground offensive in Gaza. Journalists, particularly those stationed in Gaza, find themselves in perilous circumstances as they endeavour to provide coverage amidst Israeli troop incursions, relentless airstrikes, disrupted communications, and widespread power outages, as noted by CPJ.The organisation’s report specified, “In the first eight days of the conflict, 10 Palestinian journalists have been confirmed dead, one Israeli journalist has been confirmed killed and one reported missing. On October 13, a Beirut-based journalist lost his life during a shelling attack in southern Lebanon while six others were wounded.” Amidst the escalating crisis, Israel ordered the evacuation of approximately one million residents from the northern part of Gaza to the southern territory on Friday. The United Nations has expressed grave concerns about the potential consequences of such a mass movement within a 24-hour deadline. The CPJ stressed the importance of recognising journalists as civilians who play a vital role during crises and must not be targeted by warring parties. Sherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa programme coordinator, emphasised, “Journalists are making great sacrifices across the region covering this important conflict. Measures to ensure their safety must be taken by all parties to stop this deadly and heavy toll.” (With inputs from agencies)"

Additionally, food prices have seen a reduction and we anticipate further price decreases in goods by November this year.

The Minister further spoke of the importance of transforming the education system to adapt to changing global demands. With the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence, many existing jobs worldwide are at risk of elimination, even challenging the roles of professionals like doctors and lawyers. Therefore, the education system must prepare the future generation to face and overcome these challenges effectively, he said.

The registrar identified as Ranjani, a resident of Colombo, was arrested following a complaint filed with the CID. She was produced before Court on Saturday (14). She was arrested by the CID on charges of arbitrarily sending a fraudulent letter to the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration in an attempt to help a suspect, who was subject to a travel ban, to leave the country and misplacing the case file of the suspect. The CID informed the Court that they arrested the suspect in the Court premises on Friday (13) afternoon, after informing the Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage. On 15 February, Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage remanded a suspect, who had seven charges in connection with a case of defrauding a life insurance company of more than three million rupees by forwarding false documents. He was also banned from travelling abroad. However, the CID told the Court that the person who was remanded had appealed to the High Court and was granted bail on the same day.

Governor Thondaman expressed confidence that the dialysis services for kidney patients at those hospitals would be without any hindrance, and that the rural population would immensely benefit because they no longer need to travel to distant hospitals for dialysis.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/16/sjb-refining-its-public-policy-manifesto/,SJB refining its public policy manifesto,Author not found,0,2023-10-15T20:32:00+00:00,"The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) participated in a workshop titled ‘Policymaking and Governance: Navigating Geopolitical and Economic Challenges’ on 12 October. This event was organised by the National Council of Professionals, led by the esteemed academic and educator, Dr. Tara de Mel. The workshop is part of a series of dialogues aimed at refining and enhancing the SJB’s public policy manifesto in preparation for the upcoming national elections in 2024. These dialogues serve as interactive platforms for the exchange of ideas, questions, and comments in a professional and constructive manner. They aim to ensure that the final policy manifesto presented to the public reflects extensive stakeholder engagement over an extended period. These events typically attract public policy professionals, academics, and public intellectuals who have a record of accomplishments in their respective fields. During this particular event, Dr. Irvin Studin, an accomplished Canadian academic and public intellectual, delivered the keynote address. He is the President of The Institute for 21st Century Questions, a leading Canadian think tank. Dr. Studin, a highly regarded strategy consultant, started his career as an adviser and analyst on a range of domestic and international issues within Canada’s Privy Council Office and was on secondment to Australia’s Department of the Prime Minister & Cabinet in Canberra. Dr. Studin holds a PhD from York University, as well as master’s degrees from Oxford University and LSE. He is also the chair of the Worldwide Commission to Educate All Kids (Post-Pandemic), an international initiative addressing the educational challenges faced by children affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, he is the founder, editor-in-chief, and publisher of Global Brief magazine. In the past, Dr. Studin held positions as a professor and programme director at the School of Public Policy and Governance, University of Toronto, and served as a visiting professor at renowned schools of public policy in North America, Europe, and Asia. The event also featured Emeritus Professor of Law Savitri Goonesekere, a former Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo and the first woman to hold that position. Prof. Goonesekere is a renowned scholar and pioneer in the fields of children’s rights, women’s rights, and human rights law. With her extensive experience in various positions, she stressed the importance of adopting an intersectional and multidisciplinary approach to public policy. She emphasised that public policy areas are interconnected and not isolated from other spheres of administration. These contributions are part of an ongoing dialogue project aimed at shaping the SJB’s policy manifesto. Eran Wickramaratne reiterated that the SJB is the “government in waiting” and must be prepared to hit the ground running in the new year. Over the past two years, the SJB has engaged with various worker unions, business chambers, entrepreneurial associations, and professional organisations to develop a comprehensive plan for sustainable economic growth and inclusive human development in Sri Lanka. As emphasised by Dr. Studin and Prof. Goonesekere, this requires a multi-faceted approach that considers education, healthcare, business regulation, taxation, security, defence, social welfare, pensions, and foreign policy, all interconnected. Sri Lanka’s education system must align with the needs of the 21st century and support human capital development and industrialisation while addressing demographic challenges. One of the key themes of the event was the significance of policy consistency to ensure that plans are effectively implemented. The SJB is committed to continuous policy evaluation, with regular meetings to assess progress and establish clear reporting lines. A consistent evaluation process is known to enhance the results of public policy programmes. Historically, Sri Lankan policy has been inconsistent, often driven by the preferences of individual leaders and special interest groups. There has been a lack of a comprehensive strategy, with decisions made reactively and based on short-term needs rather than long-term strategic imperatives. The recent evaluation by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concerning Sri Lanka’s progress on various conditions highlights international recognition of governance deficits and their impact on policymaking and strategy formation. The geopolitical context in which Sri Lanka finds itself, lacking a clear narrative, adds complexity to the development of an overarching economic and social policy. Before opening the floor for a lively question and answer session, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, provided concluding remarks. He called on the audience to contribute to the future governance structure"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

In a letter to the Attorney General, Minister Rambukwella said, on Wednesday (11), that despite the lack of a purchase order from the State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC) for the said stock of Immunoglobulin IV 5g vials, which preceded the procurement of pharmaceutical products, the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) had acknowledged and accepted the delivered goods, complicating matters and raising questions about the internal processes and stakeholders involved, he said. The Minister said, “Given the gravity of this situation and the potential breach of regulatory and legal standards, I request your guidance on how to proceed in handling this matter concerning internal stakeholders who are accountable. Explaining the controversy surrounding the stock of Immunoglobulin of which a portion of the order number had been delivered to the MSD, he said that subsequent complications and adverse events associated with using this drug in State Hospitals had necessitated a comprehensive investigation. Rambukwella said, during the probe it had been revealed that the particular supplier had not possessed the necessary waiver of registration (WOR) from the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) which was a critical requirement for engaging in procuring pharmaceuticals. He explained that on examination, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the NMRA could not find records of evidence indicating that a WOR had been issued to the particular pharmaceutical supplier, raising suspicions of forgery and fraud. “In light of these concerns and to uphold principals of transparency and integrity, a complaint was filed with the CID to conduct an inquiry into the matter. Meanwhile, Rambukwella, wrote to the Health Secretary and heads of all health institutions urging them to immediately suspend and cancel all the orders given to the Isolez Bio Tech Pharma.  He had also informed all payments to the particular supplier to be stopped with immediate effect until the completion of all investigations by the CID.

With the spread of the infection steps were taken to close schools, while cancellation of grade exams conducted by schools, were also reported from the Galle in a bid to stem the disease spread. Consultant Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH), Dr. Deepal Perera, when contacted, noted that the reddening of eyes, pain and discharge from the eyes and blurred vision were symptoms of the infection. He said, the disease may be associated with respiratory viral infections. He said, the eye infection could last for approximately four to five days. However, Dr. Perera urged the public to refrain from touching their eyes unnecessarily- especially when visiting public places and transport services as some who have contracted the infection may have touched their eyes and touched any of the surfaces that one may be touching or holding on to while in those areas.   The infection is seen from time to time so, there is no need to panic, the Consultant Paediatrician added.

The Additional Magistrate gave these instructions to the Police, after having perused a personal complaint lodged by Managing Director of Ascent International Private Limited, Malinga Fernando against 12 persons including cricket umpire Kumar Dharmasena, his spouse and Directors of the Pintanna Plantation Private Limited. At the previous hearing, the 12 respondents had been noticed to be present Court and to produce submissions. They complied with the exception of Dharmasena, who is currently overseas, in his capacity as an umpire, on the ICC Elite Panel, presently officiating in the ongoing ICC Men’s ODI World Cup in India. The driver of the residence had, on behalf of the occupants, lodged a complaint with the Narahenpita Police on 17 August, charging that a group led by Kumar Dharmasena, had unlawfully entered the residence bearing firearms and that the Police had failed to act on the complaint to date. President’s Counsel Nalinda Indatissa appeared for the plaintiffs. He told Magistrate Abeyratne, that after a lapse of one month and three days, since the complaint had been made, the respondent party had also lodged a complaint with the Police on 19 September. Indatissa alleged that the Police having failed to act promptly on the complaint, lodged by the plaintiffs, had proceeded to probe, only the complaint lodged by the respondents and that later two suspects had been arrested. He charged that the Police should be held accountable for their actions and dereliction of duty over the incident and their failure to conduct a transparent probe into the alleged incident. Indatissa further added that the conduct of the Narahenpita Police, had been brought to the notice of both the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL). He then stated that the Court, should instruct the Police Department to hand over the probe into the case to a special Police Team as it is obvious that Narahenpita Police had failed to carry out an unbiased probe into the incident thus far. The Magistrate then inquired from the Narahenpita Police as to why they had only acted swiftly over the complaint lodged by the respondents and not the plaintiffs. The OIC and the OIC of the Crimes Division of the Narahenpita Police then informed the Court that they had at no stage favoured either party, over the case and that a certain time period had been spent to probe the complaints lodged by both parties. They both then informed the Additional Magistrate that they will not be dissuaded by anyone to enforce the law and arrest any suspect involved in the case, irrespective of their status or clout wielded in society. Accordingly, Magistrate Abeyratne having considered submissions produced by both the plaintiffs and respondents advised the Police to apprehend all suspects behind the incident.

A peaceful solution is imperative in view of the dehumanising language that is increasingly being used against both Palestinians and Israelis, the experts said. They strongly condemn the horrific crimes committed by Hamas of Gaza, the deliberate and widespread killing and hostage-taking of innocent civilians, including older persons and children.  They also condemn Israel’s indiscriminate military attacks against the already exhausted Palestinian people of Gaza, comprising over 2.3 million, nearly half of whom are children. They have lived under unlawful blockade for 16 years, and have already gone through five major brutal wars, which remain unaccounted for,” they said.  “As the civilian death toll from the violence mounts, we call for an immediate de-escalation of tensions in the region and an effective response by the international community premised upon international law and the protection of equal rights and dignity of all,” they said. The experts urged for an immediate end to violations of international humanitarian law and human rights, in particular the right to life. To this effect, support the investigation launched by the Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Israel, into all violations reported since 7 October, including unlawful deaths and enforced disappearances and the investigation by the International Criminal Court. The agreement of a ceasefire, to be monitored by an independent, international body, the release of hostages taken by Hamas and Palestinians arbitrarily detained by Israel, particularly women, children, older persons, persons with disabilities and those who are gravely ill, the establishment of an international protective presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, the provision of all necessary financial and humanitarian aid and the creation of humanitarian corridors that allow people to leave Gaza and return as soon as the hostilities cease and the dignity of the dead from the latest violence be respected and that they are swiftly handed over to mourning relatives. On 9 October, the Israeli Defence Minister announced that authorities would completely cut essential supplies to Gaza, stating they are fighting “human animals.” The Minister threatened to bomb those attempting to provide humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. On 9 and 10 October, Israel reportedly bombed the Rafah crossing at the Gaza-Egyptian border, disrupting movement in and out of Gaza, rendering the crossing closed and the enclave completely blockaded. “Besides this appalling language that dehumanises the Palestinian people, especially those who have been unlawfully ‘imprisoned’ in Gaza for 16 years, we condemn the withholding of essential supplies such as food, water, electricity and medicines. Such actions will precipitate a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where its population is now at inescapable risk of starvation. Intentional starvation is a crime against humanity,” the experts said. “Breaking the cycle of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory is paramount,” the experts said. “Armed attacks and military responses have already proven incapable of leading to security and respect for human rights of all. Restoring international legality, accountability and respect for humanity and dignity of all must prevail, including an end to Israel’s 56 years of military occupation.”  “This amounts to collective punishment,” the UN experts said. “There is no justification for violence that indiscriminately targets innocent civilians, whether by Hamas or Israeli forces. This is absolutely prohibited under international law and amounts to a war crime.” The experts also expressed concern about reports that journalists and media workers reporting on the conflict had been targeted, with seven Palestinian journalists and media workers reportedly killed in Israeli airstrikes.

Timed with the annual meetings of the IMF-WB, Asian activists joined hundreds of other organisations worldwide marking the Global Week of Action for Debt, Climate and Economic Justice. A statement endorsed by close to 500 organisations and individuals from 74 countries across all global regions denounced the IMF-WB, saying that “together with other private and public lenders, they perpetuate a flawed international financial architecture that exacerbates debt, climate and economic crises, violating the basic needs and rights of millions of people and nature who have the least contribution, responsibility or control over these catastrophes.” In Manila, Philippines, hundreds of demonstrators marched to Mendiola, gateway to the presidential palace, with the call “Cancel the debt and pay reparations for historical and continuing injustices!” Ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos senior remains known for his repressive rule as well as for crony capitalism, massive ill-gotten wealth hidden in tax havens and billions of dollars in public debt that served no benefit for the Filipino people. Protesters also slammed the Philippine government for continued expansion and support for fossil fuel projects that they decried as ‘illegitimate debts’ for contributing to the climate crisis, dislocating communities and violating human rights. “Global South governments should stop paying for these illegitimate debts!” said Lidy Nacpil, APMDD Coordinator. “At the same time, lenders such as the IMF, the World Bank and G7 Governments should stop pushing more loans as climate finance, and swiftly start the process of debt cancellation, adoption of wealth taxes for spending on urgent economic and climate action and the rechannelling of public funds away from fossil fuel subsidies towards renewable energy systems.” APMDD members in other countries also rallied to the calls of the Global Week of Action and mobilised in the hundreds to spotlight debt, climate and economic injustices, and to hold the IMF-World Bank and the G7 Governments accountable."

Dr. Gunasekara, fielding questions during a media briefing yesterday (11), said that the Authority had received a complaint regarding a cancer drug which had also been imported by the particular local agent from India with documents allegedly issued by the NMRA. He said that here too his official seal had been forged on the documents while the medicines had also been distributed to State hospitals.   Steps had also been taken to cancel the tender which had been given to the particular agent for the importation of another medicinal drug. Dr. Gunasekara said the use of the Human Immunoglobulin had been suspended when complaints had been received from the National Hospital, Colombo, Matale and Matara Hospitals of anaphylactic reactions. Further investigations had revealed that the medicinal drug has been imported using forged documents.  Member of the Board of Directors of the NMRA, Manoj Gamage said, “The media, the public and even a section of the medical fraternity are under the misconception that the NMRA had a hand in the procurement process, whereas the Authority was the least involved in calling of tenders and the procurement process of medicines. According to the NMRA Act the ‘waiver of registration’ (WOR) is given to a medicinal drug even after the procurement procedure on the recommendations of the Health Ministry, depending on the urgency of the particular medical drug, he noted. It is unfortunate that some medical unions are ready to accuse and point fingers at the NMRA feigning ignorance of this fact.” Gamage lashed out saying that those medical trade unions would be better off if they submitted whatever evidence they had with regard to the said medicinal drug scam, to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) as the Authority had taken urgent action to lodge a complaint against the local pharmaceutical company.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

While the initial budget allocation was Rs 1.026 million per unit for the fourth phase, it was necessary to revise the budget to Rs 2.8 million per unit due to increased costs. In a commitment to improve the lives of Sri Lankan citizens, the Indian Government pledged additional funding for the speedy completion of nine development projects in the country, currently supported by the Government of India. The agreement for this initiative was also signed on the same day. These projects encompass the modernisation of 27 schools in the Northern Province, housing initiatives in Mannar and Anuradhapura, improvements to the Hatton Thondaman Vocational Training Centre and Pussellawa Saraswati Central College, construction of a multi-ethnic trilingual school in Polonnaruwa, the establishment of 2,889 rainwater harvesting projects in the Jaffna area, promotion of vegetable cultivation in the Dambulla area and the construction of greenhouse facilities with a capacity of 5,000 metric tons for fruit preservation.

This initiative is expected to empower approximately 200,000 local farmers by providing facilities such as high-quality medicines, animal nutrition and technical support.

They advised the Excise Department to mete out severe punishment such as cancellation of licences of firms that continue to be involved in the counterfeit sticker racket and non-payment of tax to the State. Chairman of COPA Lasantha Alagiyawanna, during the recent COPA deliberations on Finance, held in Parliament, advised the Treasury Secretary to submit a new Act and do away with mediation contained in the present Excise Act. Among others who were in attendance at these sessions were State Ministers Chamara Sampath, Suresh Raghavan, MPs Jayantha Ketagoda and Weerasumana Weerasinghe along with officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Excise Department. COPA instructed the Excise Department on the punishment that should be handed out to those found guilty of being involved in placing counterfeit stickers on bottles of liquor. Excise Department officials had told COPA that to date companies found guilty of engaging in the counterfeit sticker racket had refrained from paying taxes, amounting to a staggering Rs 6.6 billion. When inquired as to why Excise officers had not cancelled the licences of such liquor companies, they said provisions in the Excise Act, where such companies could be let off solely through a fine, which is included in the section ‘Mediation or settlement’, had prevented them from doing so. Alagiyawanna had then asked for details of Excise and Finance Ministry officials involved in the counterfeit sticker scam. He then proposed that a tender process should be conducted and a new company selected to print the new security stickers to be placed on bottles of liquor. He informed Excise officials that the present contract given to an Indian firm, to print security stickers, should be annulled forthwith as there were many irregularities and fraud that had been committed."

The Petition was submitted through Attorney-at-Law Manjula Balasooriya. In the petition, Dr. Amarasuriya contends that the Online Safety Bill carries significant implications for the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression, as guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. She asserts that the proposed Bill aims to curtail these fundamental rights. Referring to the Supreme Court’s decision in the case of Joseph Perera vs the Attorney-General, the petitioner emphasises that any permissible restrictions on fundamental rights, even when imposed by duly enacted laws, must not be excessive. Furthermore, the petitioner raises concerns about the appointment process for the Online Safety Commission, highlighting that unlike other independent commissions, members of this commission are not recommended by the Constitutional Council but appointed directly by the President. Dr. Amarasuriya argues that the powers vested in the Commission, as outlined in Clause 11 of the Bill, are vague, overly broad, arbitrary, unreasonable and infringe upon several constitutional articles, including Articles 3, 4(d), 10, 12(1), and 14(1)(a). She asserts that this Commission holds the authority to determine what constitutes a “prohibited statement” or a “false statement” and issue directives, with associated penal consequences for non-compliance. As a remedy, the petitioner seeks a declaration that the Bill necessitates approval via a Referendum in addition to the requisite 2/3 approval of Parliament."

India’s message of ‘Vasudhaiva Kudumbakam’ or ‘the world is one family’ can act as a binding force for IORA Member States. “India, with its extensive coastline, maritime interests, and historical ties, fully appreciates the importance of fostering collaboration and dialogue in the Indian Ocean,” said the Indian Foreign Minister adding that they  should cooperate on various aspects of the maritime economy, resources, connectivity and security. Dr A. K. Abdul Momen, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Minister of External Affairs of India, Dr. Salman Al Farisi, Secretary General of the IORA Secretariat in Mauritius and Aruni Wijewardane, Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chair of the 25th Meeting of IORA Committee of Senior Officials were present at the press briefing. Minister Sabry added that IORA was an intergovernmental organisation established in 1997. It was the brainchild of the late South African President Nelson Mandela, who envisioned an organisation to bring together the coastal States bordering the Indian Ocean to promote regional cooperation and sustainable development. “We are pleased that all Member States and the Dialogue Partners were represented at the Committee of Senior Officials and the Council of Ministers Meetings and Sri Lanka was honoured to welcome the Ministers, the Secretary General of IORA and Senior Officials from IORA countries. It was also a pleasure to welcome our newest Dialogue Partner, Saudi Arabia, which attended the IORA meetings for the first time, in Colombo,” said Sabry. It was also announced at the press briefing that the IORA member countries reviewed progress of the IORA Action Plan for 2022-2027 and identified new areas for collaboration. Sri Lanka selected ‘Strengthening Regional Architecture: Reinforcing Indian Ocean Identity’ as the theme for its IORA Chairmanship. Dr. S. Jaishankar said India had assumed the role of Vice-Chair at the IORA. He added,“India’s commitment to the well-being and progress of nations of the Indian Ocean, including as first responder and a net security provider is based on our Neighbourhood First policy, on the SAGAR outlook, and on our approach to the extended neighbourhood as well. As the Vice-Chair of IORA, the apex regional body of this Region, India will work to further strengthen regional identity and cooperation among IORA Member States, Dialogue Partners for the well-being and prosperity of the Indian Ocean community.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The Petition was submitted through Attorney-at-Law Manjula Balasooriya. In the petition, Dr. Amarasuriya contends that the Online Safety Bill carries significant implications for the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression, as guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. She asserts that the proposed Bill aims to curtail these fundamental rights. Referring to the Supreme Court’s decision in the case of Joseph Perera vs the Attorney-General, the petitioner emphasises that any permissible restrictions on fundamental rights, even when imposed by duly enacted laws, must not be excessive. Furthermore, the petitioner raises concerns about the appointment process for the Online Safety Commission, highlighting that unlike other independent commissions, members of this commission are not recommended by the Constitutional Council but appointed directly by the President. Dr. Amarasuriya argues that the powers vested in the Commission, as outlined in Clause 11 of the Bill, are vague, overly broad, arbitrary, unreasonable and infringe upon several constitutional articles, including Articles 3, 4(d), 10, 12(1), and 14(1)(a). She asserts that this Commission holds the authority to determine what constitutes a “prohibited statement” or a “false statement” and issue directives, with associated penal consequences for non-compliance. As a remedy, the petitioner seeks a declaration that the Bill necessitates approval via a Referendum in addition to the requisite 2/3 approval of Parliament."

This state-of-the-art system was implemented at a cost of Rs 1.2 billion. The cutting-edge system empowers pilots, air traffic controllers, and airlines to provide and maintain a high-quality Aeronautical Navigation Information Service, which is indispensable for the safe, profitable, and efficient execution of flight operations. Notably, Top Sky Aeronautical Information Management (AIM) system made in France by  Thales,  was fully operational at the BIA from 10 October 2023. By implementing the new computer operating system,  Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), widely regarded as the cornerstone of Aeronautical Information Service, will be easily accessible and updated using digital technology. This marks a significant leap towards paperless utilisation of Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), offering exceptional convenience. Quality and efficiency Furthermore, the adoption of this system elevates the quality and efficiency of the Aeronautical Information publication update process, ensuring a high degree of accuracy and precision in the associated database. The digitisation of the cartography section pertaining to the Aeronautical Information Service promises more precise aeronautical maps and charts, along with timely updates for new changes. The enhanced ability to manage the quality of information related to aeronautical maps and chart production represents another notable benefit. For flight planning, the submission of a Flight Plan is a mandatory requirement. With the new system in place, pilots or their representatives can now submit their Flight Plans online without the need to visit the Air Traffic Services Reporting Office, streamlining the process and improving efficiency. Rapid access Moreover, pilots gain rapid access to all Pre-Flight Information Bulletins that impact their safety during flights. Additionally, they can receive updates to their Flight Plan concerning changes in other Flight Information Regions, leading to improved Flight Plan management. Furthermore, the Aeronautical Information Service officer at the International NOTAM office will have greater ease in managing the exchange of temporary changes in Aeronautical Information Publication (NOTAM) referred to by pilots. The installation of this advanced computer operating system will substantially enhance the NOTAM system’s capability for high-level quality management. To optimise these operations, the new computer system at the Aeronautical Information Service Headquarters (AIS HQ) has received an Aeronautical Information Exchange Model Database (AIXM Database), which stands as a fundamental component of the Aeronautical Information Service. The Department of Electronic and Air Navigation Engineering played a pivotal role in achieving these remarkable milestones. Speaking at the occasion the Minister said, “As per the recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), flight operations conducted at Sri Lanka’s airstrip have been executed with a commendable emphasis on safety. Consequently, our airport has earned a notable evaluation from the ICAO, securing an impressive score of 92, establishing it as a leader in aviation operations across Southeast Asia.” The Minister also emphasised that the utilisation of state-of-the-art technical equipment has been pivotal in elevating Sri Lanka’s aviation services to a highly advanced level. Furthermore, he attributed this remarkable achievement to the exceptional expertise and unwavering commitment demonstrated by the professionals in the aviation sector. Chairman of the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Limited – Major General G.A. Chandrasiri (Retd), Civil Aviation Authority’s  Chairman– G.S.Vithanage and Director General – P.K.Jayakantha and several officials attended the event."

The party is determined to implement these policy reforms in the near future, and the process has gained momentum with the involvement of various stakeholders. The SJB’s policy platform is a product of extensive engagement and dialogue with a diverse array of stakeholders. Worker unions, business chambers, entrepreneurial associations, and professional organisations have all contributed to shaping the party’s vision for sustainable economic growth and human development in Sri Lanka. This multifaceted approach takes into account issues that span education, healthcare, business regulation, taxation, security, defence, social welfare, and pensions, recognising the interconnected nature of these facets. Sri Lanka’s foreign policy is another critical aspect of the party’s reform agenda. It acknowledges the importance of balancing strategic imperatives and local political and social dynamics that influence the nation’s relationships within the region and global perceptions of the State. Education is at the forefront of their concerns, emphasising the need for the education system to align with the demands of the 21st century technological era and contribute to human capital development and industrialisation, all while addressing demographic challenges. The party has criticised past policy approaches in Sri Lanka, which have often lacked a coherent, long-term strategy and have been reactive rather than proactive. The recent evaluation by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlighted governance deficits in Sri Lanka, further underscoring the need for comprehensive policy reform. Sri Lanka’s geopolitical context in the Indian Ocean region and the wider Western Pacific adds layers of complexity to policy development, necessitating delicate negotiation to manage relationships while safeguarding national interests. To navigate these challenges, the SJB’s policymaking team and membership will participate in a workshop titled ‘Policymaking and Governance: Navigating Geopolitical and Economic Challenges’. This event is organised by the National Council of Professionals and will feature a keynote address by Dr. Irvin Studin, a renowned Canadian academic and public intellectual. Dr. Studin is a respected strategy consultant in Canada and has been an advocate for reshaping Canadian geopolitical and political strategy. His experience includes contributing to the development of Canada’s first-ever national security policy and serving as the principal author of Australia’s 2006 national counter-terrorism policy. He holds a master’s degree from the University of Oxford and a PhD in constitutional law from the University of York. Dr. Studin’s involvement in various public policy development initiatives and his contributions to education reform make him a valuable source of insights for Sri Lanka. Dr. Studin is a critique of Canadian geopolitical strategy and its relations with the USA and traditional allies can offer valuable lessons for Sri Lanka as it seeks to position itself effectively in its immediate neighborhood and global alliances, the SJB said."

As long as the Palestinian people have breath in their bodies, they will persist in their struggle for the right to breathe the air of freedom and the right to worship,” he alleged. “We appeal to all parties in the Middle East and the Arab World to be cautious of those who use the guise of diplomacy to offer questionable incentives that further subjugate an occupied population. “Hatred only begets more hatred, and it cannot be quelled by further hatred. Encouragement of hatred from any source, whether it involves supporting one faction over another or one party over another in the theatre of conflict, must cease immediately. “The double standards evident in the policies and positions of North America and Europe concerning the Palestinian people, which also characterise much of the official stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, do not meet our expectations. “Responsible powers, whether they are global, regional, or self-proclaimed leaders, should act with maturity, prudence, and balance. They should refrain from provoking further animosity and instead exercise their responsibility delicately to guide the parties toward lasting peace with justice,” he said. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

Following this, the Association of Sri Lankan Neurologists (ASLN) urged the Health Ministry to take urgent legal action against the person or persons responsible for the procurement of the controversial intravenous immunoglobulin. The company based in India, which was purportedly involved in the production of the controversial Human Immunoglobulin IV 5g vial, has denied any association with the product, and informed the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) that they did not manufacture these vials. It was then come to light that documentation with regard to registering the product at the NMRA was forged as well. However, up to date, the authorities have failed to identify the responsible parties who carried out the scam. President of ASLN, Dr. Pyara Ratnayake in a letter to Health Minister, Keheliya Rambukwella noted yesterday (9) that the Ministry should be able to ensure the safety of patients and prevent the breakdown of public confidence in the State-run healthcare services. “The ASLN is highly perturbed by the alarming facts revealed by the NMRA regarding 22,500 Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) that were to be procured,” he said. Dr. Ratnayake said IVIG was a medication often prescribed by neurologists in life-threatening serious neurological disorders. Adverse events recorded for the said product occurred in patients under the care of two neurologists who were instrumental in bringing it to the notice of the authorities.  He said that as the main body that advocated for patients with neurological disorders, his Association was prepared to highlight the gravity of the situation to health authorities who dealt with it. It is the primary responsibility of the Health Ministry to avoid further endangering of patients by ensuring that the product has been recalled while monitoring and addressing safety concerns of patients who had already been given the IVIG. He said the Health Ministry needed to mediate and track patients in order to test and monitor them for potential adverse reactions to diseases such as blood-borne viral infections such as hepatitis (B and C) and HIV as well as for immunological reactions and other unforeseen long and short-term side effects. Dr. Ratnayake said emergency purchase of medications using waivers of registration (WOR) had become a common practice in the Health Ministry. “It is not a secret that emergency purchasing using WOR increased the cost significantly benefiting vendors and the intermediaries,” he said adding that it compromised patient safety as the stringent registration process had not been adhered to. Emergency purchasing with registration waivers should be avoided as much as possible and when undertaken an investigation should be carried out to find the responsible person or process that made it necessary to purchase IVIG urgently with a WOR, Dr. Ratnayake said. He lamented that this controversial procurement of IVIG had eroded any confidence that professionals had in the NMRA as the supreme medicinal drug regulator in the country. The ASLN stressed the need to ensure transparent and efficient function of the NMRA. BY Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Fernando and Nanayakkara filed the Petition seeking an order nullifying their suspension from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and disqualification from their parliamentary seats. A three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court fixed the hearing date when the petition was considered yesterday. The lawyers for the respondents informed the Court that, according to the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the hearing of this petition should be completed within two months from the date of filing. In light of this information, the Court instructed the petitioners to file any counter objections they may have by yesterday (10). Ministers Fernando and Nanayakkara submitted this petition on 15 August, naming SJB General Secretary Ranjith Maddumabandara among the respondents. On 18 July, the SJB Working Committee had decided to expel Fernando and Nanayakkara from the party. In May 2022, the SJB initially suspended the party membership of the duo when they accepted ministerial portfolios. Fernando and Nanayakkara explained that they accepted these ministerial positions under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s administration to address the ongoing economic crisis, as many political party leaders did not show interest in a collective effort. They later resigned from their ministerial positions on 9 July 2022, along with the entire Cabinet, following President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s announcement of his intention to resign.

The Ambassador has already communicated his travel plans to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Colombo and requested assistance for his journey to the Gaza area, which involves approximately 300-kilometre, a two-hour journey. Ambassador Bandara  said his purpose to visit the Gaza area was to assess the situation in hospitals and mortuaries to identify the two missing persons: Anula Ratnayake (49) from Kadawatha and Bandara Yatawara, a 48-year-old male from Wennapuwa. He said amidst abductions and casualties, he is journeying with an assistant to the hospitals and mortuaries in Gaza, to ascertain whether these two individuals were among the injured or deceased. Hamas militants launched rockets into Israel and carried out incursions into southern Israeli cities and towns along the Gaza Strip border. This led to the deaths and injuries of hundreds of soldiers and civilians, as well as dozens being taken hostage. The Ambassador stated that he had received information from some of Anula Ratnayake’s relatives indicating that she was killed. However, the Ambassador said he could not confirm the death until he personally investigates the situation. He has gathered all available information regarding the missing Sri Lankan woman. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been responsible for handling the bodies, and he plans to check on the status of the missing individuals. The Israeli government has announced that they are conducting a door-to-door operation around the Gaza Strip as part of a rescue mission of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas. Consequently, they have declared the area a no-man’s land. It is estimated that approximately 20- 40 Sri Lankans are working as caretakers in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip and they would be evacuated in the coming days. The majority of Sri Lankan workers reside in and around Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Further, there is speculations of potential attacks on Israel by allies of Hamas, such as Lebanon from the north of Israel which is the West Bank. Given the entry of a US warship into the Mediterranean Sea, there is a growing concern of an escalating conflict, reminiscent of the intense warfare experienced in 1967 which was known as 1967 Arab–Israeli War that lasted for six days.

The deal involving Export-Import Bank of China was reached late last month, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Tuesday at a regular press briefing in Beijing. Wang didn’t give details on how the debt was resolved, and officials in Sri Lanka didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. “Chinese financial institutions have fully participated in creditors’ meetings as observers, maintain friendly communication with other creditors and have shared developments on debt disposal,” Wang said. The deal puts Sri Lanka closer to completing its debt restructuring, as the nation boosts efforts to win agreements with other creditors such as Japan and India, as well as with holders of its foreign bonds. China accounts for about 52% of the bankrupt nation’s bilateral debt. Reaching a deal quickly will allow Sri Lanka to keep tapping funds from its USD 3 billion bailout programme with the International Monetary Fund. Sri Lankan dollar bonds due 2030 were steady at 45.8 cents on the dollar. The nation’s dollar bonds had returned more than 50% this year, according to a Bloomberg index. Bloomberg News reported last month that some members on the committee of Sri Lanka’s official creditors were pushing to reach a deal to restructure the nation’s debt without China’s participation. The members wanted the group of major creditors to sign a memorandum of understanding with Sri Lanka around the time of the IMF and World Bank meetings which are ongoing in Marrakesh, Morocco. Separately, Sri Lanka may be able to draw the outlines of a deal with holders of its defaulted dollar bonds as early as this month, Bloomberg reported in September. Sri Lanka in September agreed to restructure about USD 10 billion of local debt.  (Bloomberg)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Parliamentary Committee on Ways and Means yesterday ordered the Department to commence seizing bottles of liquor bearing counterfeit stickers and it was stated yesterday that this course of action would serve as a shining example on how best the State could explore further avenues to accrue revenues.  The Parliamentary Ways and Means Committee also has recommended that the Excise Department call a fresh tender for a new security feature for bottles of liquor following widespread issues over the current security sticker supplied by an Indian company. The Committee, which presented its first report to Parliament last month, identified many issues related to the implementation of the security feature.  “The security sticker is supposed to be foolproof but we found that it has been widely forged,” the Committee observed. Acting on instructions from the Ways and Means Committee, the Excise Department has been conducting island-wide raids over the past few weeks to take into custody bottles of liquor suspected to bear the fake security sticker. The scam is believed to have resulted in the loss of millions of rupees in tax revenue to the Excise Department. Over 100,000 bottles of liquor, were taken into custody on suspicion of containing the fake security sticker. The fines comprise compounding fees, defaulted excise charges and late fees. The Committee also observed that the current security sticker system is also not customer-friendly, with only Excise Department officials having the technology to identify genuine stickers from fake ones. As such, the Committee has recommended the introduction of a mobile application with QR-based technology to enable customers to easily identify fake security stickers. Accordingly, a customer must be able to scan the QR code on the security sticker to verify whether the product they are purchasing is genuine or not."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

He revealed this during a media briefing at the President’s Media Centre (PMC). The primary objective of this restructuring is to enhance the airline’s operational efficiency and financial stability. “A crucial aspect of this endeavour is the government’s unwavering commitment to safeguarding the job security of approximately 6,000 employees associated with the airline, throughout the restructuring process. The consultant is expected to play a pivotal role in guiding and steering the restructuring efforts towards a more sustainable and prosperous future for SriLankan Airlines,” he said. Sri Lanka’s aviation sector has reported a substantial profit of Rs 22 billion in the period from January to August 2023. The Minister said, approximately Rs 10 billion from this profit has already been contributed to Treasury, providing a much-needed boost to the country’s finances. The Minister highlighted the success of operations at Palali International Airport, emphasising that the airport has completed 200 flights. This achievement underscores the airport’s increasing significance and efficiency in handling air travel. The Minister acknowledged the challenges faced by the aviation sector in the past, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, reduced tourist arrivals and a dollar crisis that affected fuel supply for airplanes. He mentioned that, at one point, fuel for airplanes had to be procured by sending aircraft to Madras to obtain the necessary fuel. To address these challenges, the Minister of Petroleum and Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva intervened and facilitated the import of aviation fuel by the private sector, ensuring a stable supply of fuel for airplanes. Additionally, modern technology was employed to develop Bandaranaike International Airport, earning it recognition as a prominent airport in Southeast Asia. Efforts were made to increase the frequency of flights by different airlines operating in Sri Lanka. This likely contributes to improved connectivity and accessibility for travellers. These developments in the Sri Lankan aviation sector signify a positive turn in its financial performance, reflecting resilience in overcoming challenges. The government’s interventions, such as facilitating fuel supply and enhancing airport infrastructure, have contributed to this success. Increased profitability in the aviation sector is expected to have a positive impact on the country’s overall economic stability."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/10/two-sri-lankans-missing-one-injured/,"Hamas attack on Israel: Two Sri Lankans missing, one injured",Author not found,0,2023-10-09T20:36:00+00:00," As the conflict between Israeli troops and Hamas in Palestine intensifies, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, has reported that two Sri Lankans are currently missing, while one had been injured on Saturday morning (7).  Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called for the urgent need for immediate action to ensure the safety of Sri Lankan citizens who are working in Israel. These incidents happened during a surprise attack by Hamas from the Gaza strip on Israel. Speaking to Ceylon Today, Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Israel, Namal Bandara said that they have not yet confirmed any fatalities among Sri Lankans, as there have been no bodies identified to substantiate such reports. However, he added that one male worker, aged 38, sustained minor injuries and is currently in the process of recovery. According to the Ambassador, there is uncertainty regarding the two missing individuals, a 48-year-old male and a 49-year-old woman. He speculated that there may be several individuals who have been potentially kidnapped by Hamas, but this also requires further confirmation. The Ambassador stated that yesterday (9), three officials from SLFBE arrived in Tel Aviv to assess the situation of the Sri Lankan workers. They reached their destination at around 12:30 pm, noted by the Ambassador. The President directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to locate and ensure the well-being of these individuals. Additionally, he called for assistance in facilitating the return of Israelis, including tourists and employees, from Sri Lanka to Israel and urged the Police to provide necessary security measures for Israelis within Sri Lanka. Currently, there are 8,000 Sri Lankan workers primarily employed in the healthcare and agriculture sectors in Israel. The Ambassador emphasised that the ‘war’ is primarily targeted against Hamas and not the Palestinian population and further highlighted that the country remains peaceful for the most part. “It’s normal right now and the buses and people are on the move as usual in Tel Aviv,” he said. He also added during air strikes by Hamas, they go to the bunkers as all buildings have bunkers to hide.  Rockets fired from Gaza have been intercepted by Israel’s air defence system and there were no serious damages and those who died came under physical attacks by the Hamas militants. Hamas fighters initiated a surprise attack, utilising both land and air operations, targeting the Israeli settlements surrounding the Gaza Strip last Saturday. The SLBFE said that the Sri Lankan Government is working with the Sri Lankan Embassy in Israel to ensure the safety of Sri Lankans employed in Israel. If there are any Sri Lankans living in Israel who have undergone any issue due to ensuing war, the SLBFE said that they can reach contact 0094-716640560 via WhatsApp. The SLBFE also said that if anyone needs to find information on Sri Lankans living in Israel, information can be accessed by contacting the hotline number 1989. The Sri Lankan Embassy in Israel has asked all Sri Lankans in Israel to be vigilant and exercise caution while following the safety protocols advised by local law enforcement authorities. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka said that the Sri Lanka missions in Tel Aviv and Ramallah are keeping a close eye on the escalating situation and are in contact with the Sri Lankans living in the affected areas. The matter was discussed at yesterday’s Cabinet meeting and President Ranil Wickremesinghe briefed the Cabinet about the current situation in Israel, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said. “There are many Sri Lankans working in Israel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs must locate them and ensure their safety. There are a number of Israelis in Sri Lanka – some are tourists and some are employed. We must help them to travel back to Israel. I have also asked the Police to lookafter the Israelis in Sri Lanka,” the President said. The President also said Sri Lanka always supported two States concept of Israel and Palestine. We are steadfast in our support. At times we have condemned Israel’s actions. Nevertheless, all this does not justify Hamas attack on Israel killing a large number of civilians. The Government of Sri Lanka condemns this unprecedented attack.” He also warned about potential economic repercussions on Sri Lanka owing to the ongoing war with Hamas. The fighting and violence must be brought to an end immediately. Sri Lanka is in agreement with the African Union proposal. There is another impact of this crisis. The petrol prices were expected to rise to USD 100 per barrel and thereafter recede from end February. This crisis will only create a further shortage of fuel ensuring that fuel prices will remain high for a longer time. This is a big blow to the developing economies, he pointed out.  Meanwhile, major airlines around the world have cancelled flights to Israel or warned of travel disruption as the security situation deteriorates. Virgin Atlantic warned of cancellations and delays to Tel Aviv and British Airways (BA) has altered its schedule. Also, three US carriers, as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended services. Palestinian militants Hamas said that they had targeted Israel’s Ben Gurion airport with missiles on Monday. Virgin Atlantic said it had made eight cancellations between Tel Aviv and London Heathrow, from Saturday until this coming Wednesday.UK budget carrier Wizz Air confirmed it had cancelled flights to and from Tel Aviv until further notice, while EasyJet halted flights on Sunday and Monday, adding that it would alter it schedule for the rest of this week.

In a letter to President Wickremesinghe, the Bishops’ Conference said that during the interview with the ‘Deutsche Welle News’ the President had stated that the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), British Police, the Australian, the Indian, the Chinese and the Pakistani secret services had given reports concerning the attacks. “The fact has been bought to the attention of the general public as well as the Bishops’ Conference for the first time,” the Bishops observed. They noted that the President had repeatedly stated that his dealings with the Catholic Church were with the Bishops’ Conference of Sri Lanka and not with the Cardinal. They pointed out that the Cardinal himself was the Archbishop of Colombo and did not “exist alone.” He was an integral and most vital member of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference in Sri Lanka. “Hence, the reference to the Cardinal in a singular manner undermines the collegiality of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference which comprises the bishops of the 12 Dioceses of Sri Lanka and the three Auxiliary Bishops of Colombo,” they pointed out. While thanking the President for handing over the volumes of the Presidential Commission of inquiry Report into the Easter Sunday attacks, they appealed to him to also share with them the reports on the investigations carried out by the several international secret service services.

Although various animals, including birds, dogs and other creatures, may have consumed the deceased fish, there is no evidence to suggest that poisoning was involved, according to the Health Department Anuradhapura. Wijesinghe revealed that approximately 75 per cent of the fish population in Kumbicchankulama lake has perished, but the situation is now under control. The Municipal Commissioner emphasised that this occurrence may have been triggered by a decrease in oxygen levels and an increase in algae due to a rapid reduction in the lake’s water volume and a surge in the fish population caused by the severe drought affecting the area. Furthermore, the municipal council has taken measures to remove dead fish daily and steps have been taken to disrupt the water using boats in order to manage the algae issue, which has now been successfully addressed. In addition, water samples and samples of dead fish have been forwarded to relevant health and other departments for the reports. Anuradhapura East Divisional Secretary Sampath Dharmadasa said these reports will be received soon. By Chula Bandara Kulasekara and Ananda Jayasiri – Mahawilachchiya"

MCPA President Dr. Chamal Sanjeeva yesterday (9) called President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s attention to the risk of a spread in harmful diseases such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) /AIDS and hepatitis due to the recent trend in importing medicinal drugs sans proper testing. “It is highly unfortunate that the medicinal drugs which come into the State Health service, through the Medical Supplies Division (MSD), lacks this international accepted standard of going through a proper laboratory testing to ensure that they do not carry substances which could be harmful.” He noted that this was vital when producing medicines with human blood or using components obtained from living people. These should be tested in suitable laboratories before giving them to a patient as they may lead to the transmission of diseases. He also urged the Director General Health Service to test those patients who had been administered the immunoglobulin, which even the parent company in India had disowned, according to the Health Minister and the Chairman of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), for blood-related communicable diseases. The MCPA President said that according to the statements made by the Health Minister and the Chairman of the NMRA, the said stock of Immunoglobulin had been imported using forged documents.

He made this comment addressing the media last morning, when asked for his take on the recent decision given by the country’s Apex Court, regarding changing of political parties by MPs. Speaking further, Amaraweera said, “In the aftermath of this decision delivered by the Supreme Court, I know it for a fact that there are a sizeable number of lawmakers, who had resorted to such measures in the recent past, but who are currently shaking in their boots. There are some who are even in the present Cabinet. Hence, they have a genuine and strong fear that their Ministerial posts and parliamentary seats will be in serious jeopardy if it is challenged before the Supreme Court.” When asked whether he is not unduly concerned about his own position, the Minister replied there is no such fear.  “No, I have no such fears because I never changed my original political party from which I contested the last General Election. I have continued to be an SLFPer and that will be my party even in the future. None of us ditched our party and therefore we are not concerned about any ramifications. The decision to support this regime was taken by the party Central Committee. But I know it with certainty that most of those who had visions of ditching their political parties are now shivering in their boots in the wake of this momentous decision by the Supreme Court.” BY Hansi Nanayakkara"

During a press conference held in Colombo, LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne explained that this decision was taken due to the absence of a practical emission testing programme. He stressed that the association would formally communicate this decision in writing to the transport authorities within the current week. Wijeratne highlighted the significant challenges related to emission tests for private buses, emphasising that these tests are not being conducted effectively. Additionally, Wijeratne raised concerns about the quality of fuel provided to buses, stating, “We have consistently raised issues regarding the deteriorating quality of diesel fuel. There is a genuine problem with the diesel quality supplied.” Moreover, he pointed out that emission tests are not being conducted on buses operated by the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) or other government vehicles. He argued that since private buses charge the same fares as SLTB buses and offer comparable services, the law should be applied consistently to all. Consequently, the LPBOA intends to submit a written notification to the Ministry of Transport next week, officially declaring their decision to discontinue emission testing for their buses from January."

Recently, Miyon Lee, the South Korean Ambassador to Sri Lanka, held a meeting with Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and officials from the Ministry of Agriculture. The discussions centered on the future development of Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector. Among the topics discussed were strategies to increase paddy yields, the use of both chemical and organic fertiliser, the application of genetic technology for hybrid seed production, the adoption of new agricultural technology, and training opportunities for officials in the agricultural sector in both South Korea and Sri Lanka. Minister Amaraweera recalled that Sri Lankan officials and scientists had previously received advanced agricultural training under the KOICA programme, which is currently suspended. He requested the Ambassador’s support in resuming this valuable programme. In response, the Ambassador expressed her willingness to convey the request to the Korean Government. Regarding fertiliser use, the Ambassador highlighted that South Korea employs a combination of chemical and organic fertiliser to achieve high agricultural yields. South Korean farmers receive comprehensive training in this regard. She also emphasised that, for various crops, including paddy, optimal results can be achieved by using a mix of chemical and organic fertilisers. In response to a query from the Ambassador, about the progress of Sri Lanka’s livestock sector, Amaraweera explained that while the country had achieved self-sufficiency in poultry and egg production until 2020, challenges stemming from the economic crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic in the last two years had disrupted these industries. However, he expressed optimism that the poultry and egg production industry is on a path to recovery and expected significant growth in the sector by April of the coming year.

The SSP Fertiliser produced by using Eppawala Rock Phosphate, is very suitable for rice and other crops and can be used as a substitute for TSP which is currently imported. The annual cost of importing TSP Fertiliser is about three billion rupees. Most of these fertilisers are produced in the countries under the Russian Federation and due to the current war between Ukraine and Russia, there are problems in importing TSP. Therefore, by producing this single superphosphate, the country will be able to save three billion rupees. The government took steps to provide free TSP in the last Yala season. Currently, another stock of that fertiliser is with the government-owned fertiliser companies and farmers also have some quantity of that Fertiliser.  Four local companies in Sri Lanka have taken the necessary steps to produce SSP Fertiliser  locally and the representatives of those companies met the Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera recently. This discussion was held at the Ministry of Agriculture. The amount of TSP Fertiliser required in this country is about 65,000 MT. Fertiliser manufacturing companies have the capacity to produce this required amount and currently have nearly 4,000 MT of Single Super Phosphate fertiliser in stock. The company representatives said that they are able to produce the SSP Fertiliser that the country needs. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that under the full supervision of the Department of Agriculture, the fertiliser can be produced and distributed by Lanka Fertiliser Company and Commercial Fertiliser Companies. Gunadasa Samarasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr. Jagath Perera, Chairman of the two government-owned fertiliser companies and Chandana Lokuheva, Director of the National Fertiliser Secretariat, also participated in this discussion."

Santhan claimed that the Union Home Ministry had passed an order on 11 November 2022 ordering that he should not move out of the boundaries of the special camp till his deportation to his home country.

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer.

He said to realistically meet the challenge of providing a ‘quality and equitable education’ which is the fourth of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, teachers have been assigned a crucial role in the new transformative education process in Sri Lanka. The Ministry of Education, coinciding with World Teachers’ Day on 6 October, held this award ceremony and 70 principals and teachers belonging to 26 schools who were sensitive to the various problems faced at the school level were appreciated. Regarding the issue of ‘brain drain,’ which is presently affecting numerous professions in Sri Lanka, the Minister asserted that intellectuals who are leaving the country during challenging times are, in fact, individuals who have benefited from the country’s free education system and have enjoyed the associated social advantages but are now displaying a lack of commitment or foresight. He emphasised that their responsibility, particularly during such challenging periods, should not be to leave the country but rather to stay and utilise their skills to confront and overcome these challenges. Minister Premajayantha highlighted the crucial role of graduate teachers who possess the requisite knowledge and training skills in implementing transformative educational changes. These changes aim to foster a high-quality generation of students proficient in new STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education methods, which incorporate practical classroom activities to apply theoretical knowledge effectively.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/09/israel-declares-war-on-hamas/,Israel declares war on Hamas,Author not found,0,2023-10-08T20:35:00+00:00,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says his Security Cabinet has declared the country at war following a deadly Hamas assault in southern Israel. The decision, announced on Sunday (8), formally authorises “the taking of significant military steps,” it said in a statement. “The war that was forced on the State of Israel in a murderous terrorist assault from the Gaza Strip began at 06:00 on Saturday (7),” it said. It gave no further details. But Netanyahu had previously declared the country at war, and the military has promised a harsh response in Gaza. Israeli media say at least 600 people have been killed in the surprise cross-border incursion by Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip. Israeli soldiers battled Hamas fighters in the streets of southern Israel on Sunday and launched retaliation strikes that levelled buildings in Gaza, while in northern Israel a brief exchange of strikes with Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group raised fears of a broader conflict. There was still some fighting underway more than 24 hours after an unprecedented surprise attack from Gaza, in which Hamas militants, backed by a volley of thousands of rockets, broke through Israel’s security barrier and rampaged through nearby communities. At least 600 people have reportedly been killed in Israel — a staggering toll on a scale the country has not experienced in decades — and more than 300 have been killed in Gaza. The militants also took captives back into the coastal Gaza enclave, including women, children and the elderly, who they will likely try to trade for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The high death toll, multiple captives and slow response to the onslaught pointed to a major intelligence failure and undermined the long-held perception that Israel has eyes and ears everywhere in the small, densely populated territory it has controlled for decades. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was at war and would exact a heavy price from its enemies. Hamas leaders said they were prepared for further escalation. A major question now was whether Israel will launch a ground assault into Gaza, a move that in the past has brought intensified casualties. Netanyahu vowed that Hamas “will pay an unprecedented price.” But, he warned, “This war will take time. It will be difficult.” Civilians paid a staggering cost for the violence on both sides. Several Israeli media outlets, citing rescue service officials, said at least 600 people were killed in Israel, including 44 soldiers, while officials in Gaza said 313 people had died in the territory. Some 2,000 people have been wounded on each side. An Israeli official said security forces have killed 400 militants and captured dozens more. Israeli TV news aired a stream of accounts from the relatives of captive or missing Israelis, who wailed and begged for assistance amid a fog of uncertainty surrounding the fate of their loved ones. In Gaza, residents fled homes near the border to escape Israeli strikes, fleeing deeper inside the territory after warnings in Arabic from the Israeli military. In neighbouring Egypt, a Policeman shot dead two Israeli tourists and an Egyptian at a tourist site in Alexandria, the Interior Ministry said. Egypt made peace with Israel decades ago, but anti-Israel sentiment runs high in the country, especially during bouts of Israeli-Palestinian violence. The flare-up on Israel’s northern border also threatened to draw into the battle Hezbollah, a fierce enemy of Israel’s which is backed by Iran and estimated to have tens of thousands of rockets at its disposal. Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets and shells on Sunday at three Israeli positions in a disputed area along the border and Israel’s military fired back using armed drones. Two children were lightly wounded by broken glass on the Lebanese side, according to the nearby Marjayoun Hospital. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military official, told reporters the situation at the northern border was calm after the exchange. But he said fighting was still underway in the south and that there were still hostage situations there. He said troops had moved into every community near the Gaza frontier, where they planned to evacuate all civilians and scour the area for militants. “We will go through every community until we kill every terrorist that is in Israeli territory,” he said. In Gaza, “every terrorist located in a house, all the commanders in houses, will be hit by Israeli fire. That will continue escalating in the coming hours.” Hamas said that overnight it had continued to send forces and equipment into “a number of locations inside our occupied territories,” referring to Israel. Hamas-linked media reported that the son of Nizar Awadallah, a senior political official, was killed. The Islamic militant group has not reported any senior members being captured, killed or wounded. The surprise attack Saturday was the deadliest on Israel in decades. In an assault of startling breadth, Hamas gunmen used explosives to break through the border fence enclosing Gaza, then crossed with motorcycles, pickup trucks, paragliders and speed boats on the coast. They rolled into as many as 22 locations outside the Gaza Strip early Saturday morning, including towns and other communities as far as 24 kilometers (15 miles) from the Gaza border, while Hamas launched thousands of rockets at Israeli cities.

Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

They will come under the supervision of oncology surgeons and are a crucial addition to the existing Suvanari clinics and cancer early detection centres, Dr. Hasareli Fernando, the Head of the National Cancer Control Programme in Sri Lanka revealed. During an interview in the ‘One-to-one Katha’ programme, conducted by the President’s Media Division (PMD), Dr Fernando said the primary aim of these clinics is to enhance the early detection of breast cancer, a disease that ranks as the most prevalent form of cancer among women both in Sri Lanka and globally, the PMD said. Dr. Fernando said while breast cancer cannot be prevented, early detection offers the potential for complete cure. This expansion of healthcare infrastructure is a significant step forward in ensuring better healthcare access and outcomes for the people of Sri Lanka. “Breast cancer is not limited to women, as men can also be affected, albeit at a significantly lower rate. Over 80% of breast cancer cases occur in individuals aged 50 and above. Risk factors for breast cancer include family history, genetic mutations, late childbirth, and a history of previous breast cancer battles. Other factors such as early puberty, late menopause, and hormonal birth control usage may also contribute to the risk,” she said. While some risk factors are beyond an individual’s control, there are modifiable factors that can be addressed, including weight management, dietary choices, regular exercise and alcohol and tobacco consumption. The most effective method for early detection of breast cancer is through regular breast self-examinations, especially for women over the age of 20. Routine self-exams should be conducted on a specific date each month, and individuals should be vigilant for any new changes, such as the presence of a lump, changes in skin texture, color or shape, nipple discharge, or nipple inversion. The Ministry of Health has also taken steps to establish five cancer screening centres in Narahenpita, Ratnapura, Matara, Batticaloa, and Jaffna, in addition to the 30 new breast clinics supervised by specialist cancer surgeons in government hospitals across Sri Lanka. Individuals are encouraged to visit these facilities for necessary tests and medical advice. Cancer cases are on the rise in Sri Lanka and globally. In 2020, Sri Lanka witnessed over 37,000 new cancer diagnoses, with breast cancer being the most common form, accounting for 26% of women’s cancer diagnoses. Worldwide, breast cancer remains a significant health concern, with 2.2 million cases reported in 2020, resulting in 685,000 deaths. Dr. Fernando also emphasised the importance of dietary choices in preventing cancer, recommending the reduction of fast-food consumption and mindful weight management. Additionally, engaging in regular exercise, avoiding smoking and smokeless tobacco products, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are vital steps in cancer prevention."

He was addressing the Sankathana Mandapaya held at Temple Trees on 7 October to mark World Cotton Day. The Prime Minister said, “World Cotton Day is a special day declared by the United Nations. It is declared a special day because it is useful for the people of the world. We dedicate ourselves to making this day meaningful for the cotton industry. In every district, we encounter thousands of acres of uncultivated land belonging to the Government. There is a possibility of using these lands for a useful purpose like cotton cultivation. We are ready to extend our support and commitment in this regard. By expanding cotton cultivation through a continuous national programme, the income of the rural people can be increased and the foreign exchange of the country can be saved. I appreciate the attempts of the private sector to this end. Farmers and entrepreneurs need confidence to engage in this kind of cultivation. It is necessary to cooperate with our universities and other research institutes to expand this industry. An innovative system should be introduced to cultivate cotton in small gardens as an additional income. Almost a hundred years have elapsed since we started creating agricultural colonies with the belief that we can raise our heads through agriculture. In those colonies, there is the possibility of cultivating on every piece of land. People need to be directed to that. We are ready to have discussions on this matter with relevant institutions. Imported weaving machinery was available in certain buildings. Some were gifted to our country. These resources should be given to universities or entrepreneurs to focus on achieving goals. We must undergo such a change if we want to recover from the crisis. It’s necessary to enact new rules instead of relying on old rules. Countries such as the United Kingdom, US, India, China, and Egypt are still engaged in cotton production. We have to explain to the people about the production of seeds and the many benefits associated with them. By opening the doors of working generation of villages to universities, the children can be trained and those who graduate from university will contribute to the nation’s productivity in the future. We also import pieces of gauze from overseas. The quality of life index has decreased. But the prices of goods are not cheap. Even if the farmers produce surplus, the price is determined by the purchasing power of the people. Farmers need a satisfactory purchase price. An agreement should exist between the private sector and the government sector on the prices.” Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme said, “The support of UNDP will be rendered to the Government’s efforts to develop the cotton industry of Sri Lanka with the active participation of the private sector and farmers. This industry with a history of more than 2,500 years can be used to boost the economy of rural farming families. In addition to the production of cotton cloth, there is the possibility of starting various industries related to the cotton industry, which generates valuable products such as cotton oil and animal feed. Especially, this is a gateway to the world of fashion from the cotton industry and I call it ‘Farm to Fashion’. The perseverance of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena to uplift the rural people including small farm owners and small and medium scale entrepreneurs, especially women is highly appreciated.” Speaking at this occasion, Buddika Marasinghe said, “It is possible to start this cultivation on a large scale as well as in home gardens. Although it is a project that brings foreign exchange to the country which the Government should actively intervene in, the support of the Government is inadequate. The Government should implement a speedy programme to encourage the private sector, the farmer as well as the young entrepreneur to expand this cultivation.” At this function, Polonnaruwa Welikanda cotton farmers presented a casket containing cotton seeds and products to the Prime Minister. Minister Douglas Devananda, State Ministers Seetha Arambepola, Ashoka Priyantha, Vijitha Berugoda, Kader Mastan, MPs Jagath Samarawickrama, Yadamini Gunawardena, Secretaries to the Ministries, University Vice Chancellors, heads of government and non-government institutions, young entrepreneurs, and farmers were present at this occasion."

He added that a sum of Rs 80 to 110 has to be incurred to produce a kilo of soya beans and with the decision taken by them to purchase a kilo at Rs 250, the farmers would be able to receive a fair price for their harvest and earn sizeable profit.  BY Hansi Nanayakkara"

During these sessions it had come to light that though the NAO has given five previous reminders to the NMRA, seeking requisite details, the latter had continued to ignore those reminders drawing the ire of COPE MPs. It has been revealed that during a Board Meeting convened by the NMRA, on 18 August, a decision had been taken not to submit any information to the NAO in this regard. However, it has also been disclosed that the Secretary to the Health Ministry had been totally in the dark over the decision taken last August by the NMRA Board of Directors. Chairman of COPE MP Prof. Ranjith Bandara stated that the actions of the NMRA had flouted Articles of the Constitution, the arbitrary takeover of the authority of Parliament as well as infringing on the independence of the Auditor General. During the sessions the Auditor General had warned that if the NMRA declines to furnish information sought by him, he would henceforth withdraw from his work related to the institution concerned. Afterwards the COPE instructed the NMRA to forthwith withdraw its stance on refusing to comply with the request of the Auditor General and warned them that failing to comply with this order will result in them to be ready to face up to consequences over the same.

Raising a question, under the Standing Order 27/2, Dissanayake asked on whose behalf and on what basis these concessions were granted. Dissanayake, who alleged that the tax concessions were granted to the said company by changing the agreement with the Borad of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI), questioned, “The President always tells other parties to join him. Is he inviting us to join and support these frauds?” He pointed out that the government has previously granted tax concessions to friendly companies. Dissanayake expressed a desire to understand the Ministry of Industry’s stand on this specific Cabinet Paper to grant tax concessions to the vehicle assembly company. He also sought clarification on the specific criteria for providing tax relief to this company, emphasising the importance of every dollar to the country’s economy amid challenging circumstances.  He raised concerns about the government offering tax concessions to associates, drawing parallels with previous instances that initially led to sugar tax scam etc. In response, Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha said, a reply for Dissanayake’s question would be provided today (6).

He lamented that his outfit had continued to cater to people despite the increase in fuel, electricity and water bills. However with the increase in the price of gas, the union has taken a decision to hike the cost of the above mentioned food items, Rukshan noted. However, President of the National Consumer Front (NCF), Asela Sampath, lashing out, said the Government should urgently slap a price formula to decide on the maximum price for food items such as the lunch packet, kottu, fried rice, plain tea, milk tea, raw rice, coconut, big onions, dhal and sugar. Failing to do so would only boost the level of malnutrition by 60 per cent, he warned.      By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Bengamuwe Dhammadinna Thera expressed his dissatisfaction with the Department of Wildlife Conservation’s (DWC) practice of issuing entrance tickets to local and foreign tourists, who visit Sri Pada via the Hatton and Ratnapura roads during the off-season. In a special statement to the media yesterday (5), Ven. Thera highlighted that historically, no charges were imposed on pilgrims visiting Sri Pada, whether during the peak season or the off-season, dating back to the reign of the kings. Consequently, he deemed it unjust for the Department of Wildlife Conservation to levy fees and issue tickets to local and foreign tourists during the off-season. Yesterday (5) morning, a group of tourists from Bhutan, having obtained permission, embarked on a visit to Sri Pada. Tickets were issued to them by the Wildlife Conservation Office located near the Makara Thorana (Dragon’s Arch) on the Nallathanniya – Sri Pada Main Road, at a fee of USD 5 per tourist. When queried about the issuance of tickets to tourists travelling to Sri Pada during the off-season, an official from the Nallathanniya Wildlife Conservation Office referred to a Gazette issued by the Department of Wildlife Conservation in 2022. The Gazette specified that, as of the afternoon of 4 October, the department had been instructed by senior officials to charge USD five from foreign tourists visiting Sri Pada via Nallathanniya and USD four from those coming from SAARC countries. Additionally, a fee of Rs 40 would be imposed on local tourists and these tickets would be available exclusively during the off-season. Nallathanniya Tourism Hotel Owners’ Association also voiced its objections to the Wildlife Conservation Department’s practice of issuing tickets to tourists visiting Sri Pada during the off-season.

Additionally, the President has alerted relevant agencies to formulate contingency plans for the safety and well-being of the populace in the event of worsening flood situations. In the interim, President Wickremesinghe has issued directives to relevant government departments to remain vigilant regarding potential disaster situations that may arise in other districts due to adverse weather conditions. A total of 9,448 individuals from 2,350 families across 16 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in the Matara District have been impacted by various calamities including floods, strong winds, landslides, heavy rains, rock falls, and tree falls. Among these, 399 houses have sustained partial damage, with 37 other properties affected.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Court issued this directive during a session presided over by a three-Judge Bench, comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, A.H.M.D. Nawaz, and Mahinda Samayawardena. MP Prof. G.L.

The petitioners have raised concerns about the decision to lower the interest rates on investments made by the EPF in government securities, under the DDO programme. They argue that this reduction, which lowered the interest rate to nine per cent, violates the fundamental rights of approximately 2.5 million working individuals with active accounts in the EPF, whose funds are primarily invested in Treasury Bills and Bonds. Furthermore, the petition contends that the CBSL’s Monetary Board failed to seek the input of EPF members before involving the Fund in the DDO programme."

Speaking in Parliament yesterday (5), Gamage made a strong speech alleging that Maddumabandara had used derogatory language towards her in Parliament. “Verbal abuse constitutes a form of sexual harassment through these types of words, which is not only offensive to me, but also an affront to all women in the country, who make up 52 per cent of the population and actively participate in the electoral process. There should be a disciplinary action against Maddumabandara. How dare he use such language on a woman in this House?” she stressed. She further addressed the grudges held by some Opposition members, suggesting that if they struggle to perform their duties adequately, they could learn from her and exchange roles for a day to gain experience. “Maddumabandara is in this Parliament only because I gave him the post of General secretary of the SJB. He is in the House because of me,” she asserted. At that moment, SJB MP Chaminda Wijesiri said it was not fair to accuse Maddumabandara as he was not in the Chamber. Gamage then slammed Wijesiri saying it was not her fault that Maddumabandara failed to attend the Parliamentary sittings. Following this, the SJB MPs started to shout in protest. “This Bandara (Maddumabandara) and several other Bandaras have grudges against me. These men cannot do their jobs properly. I can lend them one of my sarees, so they can do a woman’s job and I can wear a trouser to show how to do a man’s job properly.

He began by underlining the alarming projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), emphasising the existential threat posed by global warming. President Wickremesinghe stressed the interconnected nature of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and their devastating impact on individuals and communities worldwide. The President then pledged Sri Lanka’s commitment to addressing these challenges. He announced plans to accelerate nature-based solutions, including renewable energy, through the Climate Prosperity Plan and unveiled an ambitious Net Zero 2050 roadmap. Despite Sri Lanka’s small global emissions contribution, the country aims to achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, increase renewable energy generation, expand forest cover, phase out coal power, and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. President Wickremesinghe also expressed deep concern over the state of global biodiversity, emphasising the rapid loss of species and the threat of extinction due to habitat destruction and invasive species. He concluded by calling for collective action and addressing the need for financing to support climate initiatives, highlighting the challenges in current discussions regarding funding for vulnerable countries. President Wickremesinghe proposed alternative mechanisms, including using the balance sheets of New Development Banks (NDBs) to leverage private funds and calling for debt relief for low-income countries. He also touched upon the Vanuatu Resolution, which has taken climate change before the International Court of Justice, emphasising climate justice as a human right."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/06/which-south-asian-country-is-performing-on-sdgs-sorry-none/,Which South Asian Country is Performing on SDGs? – Sorry… None!,Author not found,0,2023-10-05T20:31:00+00:00," Out of seven countries in South Asia (Bhutan, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan), only two countries; the Maldives on poverty reduction, the Maldives and Sri Lanka on quality education are on track, for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), says Sustainable Development Goals (SDR) Review Report 2023, published by the United Nations (UN) Agency. The Sustainable Development Report (SDR) reviews progress made each year on the Sustainable Development Goals since their adoption by the 193 UN Member States in 2015. At the halfway mark to 2030, the SDR 2023 takes stock of progress made and discusses priorities to restore and accelerate SDG progress. This analysis has taken the top 7 SDG indicators for discussion; Poverty, Hunger, Health, Education, Gender Equality and access to Clean Water and Sanitation to make an assessment of where we stand today in the region on important development parameters. Mostly on Red Zone Halfway to the deadline for the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, South Asian countries are mostly in the ‘major challenge group’ category.  The SDG progress report shows that just 2 countries in South Asia- the Maldives is on track with only one indicator of ‘No Poverty’ and the Maldives and Sri Lanka are making some progress on ‘Quality Education’.  The progress on most of the other SDG indicators in these countries is either weak or/and insufficient.  Worst of all, most of the South Asian countries have stalled or gone into reverse (major challenges-red zone) category. The performance of 5 out of 7 countries on Hunger and Health, and 4 on accessing Clean Water and Sanitation are completely in bad shape.  Unless these countries act first, it will be an impossible task for these countries to achieve SDGs goals by 2030. The report says that Hunger has increased in most of the South Asian countries and is back at 2005 levels, gender equality is some 300 years away.  Such progress on key SDG indicators means that something is fundamentally wrong with the governance of the system that delivers such a negative outcome. If the execution of SDGs falls short, what may happen? Looking at the present progress, it looks like, many human development SDG indicators may not be achieved; neither by 2030 nor 2050. So, what are the possible consequences if the execution of the SDGs falls short, what may happen if the targets are not scored in 2030?  The consequence of not executing the SDGs may lead to an exacerbation of problems such as poverty and hunger. Moreover, complex issues related to gender equality and other indicators are likely to remain underachieved. If existing trends continue to persist, by 2030, 575 million people will be trapped in extreme poverty and an estimated 84 million children and young people will be out of education globally importantly, most of these people, affected will be either from South Asian or African countries.  The failure to reach the target SDGs indicator is likely to negatively affect millions of people in these developing and least developed countries in the South Asian region, with substantial damage to livelihoods, an exacerbation of poverty and the spread of diseases. Hunger in the region- Most Priority area The SDG implementation in South Asian countries assumes much significance as there are more than 33 per cent of the people living in extreme poverty globally live in this region. The pandemic further trapped millions in the region to fall into the poverty trap, worsening the hunger situation. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2022 ranks South Asian countries with Sri Lanka (64th) followed by Nepal (81st) and Bangladesh (84th). Both Sri Lanka and Nepal are placed in the ‘moderate’ severity level. Afghanistan (109th), India (107th) and Pakistan (99th) are the bottom three countries in the South Asia  2022 GHI index. It is extremely worrying to find that poverty and hunger continue to diminish South Asia’s development progress significantly and in a way show how SDG is implemented in the region.  India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal have child labour populations of 5.8 million, 5 million, 3.4 million and 2 million respectively, as per a survey by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which indicates that quality education for children in the region is not on the track as expected and committed by  South Asian leaders on SDG. Failing SDG reflects, nothing but the policy failure Without a renewed commitment and energy (after global disturbance due to the pandemic), we can risk putting many of the SDGs permanently off the track. With only seven years remaining for implementation of the Goals, the South Asia region cannot afford slow progress and these countries have to take strong actions to reduce extreme Poverty and Hunger as data shows, the number of people living in extreme poverty and hunger is increasing for the first time in a generation. Each hungry person, each desperately poor person, each child without education, and each person without having access to safe and clean drinking water, reflects nothing but a policy failure. No country can afford to see them fail. About the Author: Sachi Satapathy is the Director, AF Development Care, New Delhi, India: [email protected] By Sachi Satapathy"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts.

According to recent reports, there should be 616 teachers in these schools, but the current number stands at only 455. This alarming shortage of teachers came to light during a District Coordinating Committee meeting chaired by MP Akila Ellawala, organised by District Secretary Wasantha Gunaratne. In 2022, despite 651 Tamil medium students appearing for the scholarship exam, only 27 of them managed to achieve the cutoff marks, a startling revelation made during the committee meeting. Chairman of the committee, MP Akila Ellawala, discussed potential solutions for primary schools through the Provincial Council. However, he stressed the need to make a written request to the Ministry of Education and the responsible minister to address the acute shortage of Advanced Level science and mathematics teachers in national schools. Chief Secretary of the Province Mahinda S. Weerasuriya proposed seeking special permission to recruit graduate teachers from the North and Eastern Provinces to alleviate the shortage of Advanced Level Tamil language teachers. He highlighted that while teachers were previously recruited from these regions, they were transferred back after five years, exacerbating the problem. In response to a question from MP Varuna Liyanage, the Provincial Assistant Director of Education reported that in 2022, only about 4.1% of the 651 Tamil medium students who took the scholarship examination managed to pass. Additionally, it was revealed that poverty among plantation workers has led to many children discontinuing their education after grades three, four, or five. As a humanitarian concern, it was suggested, during the meeting, to establish a committee to investigate and address this issue. BY K.A.S. Piyathilaka – Kuruvita"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/06/mepa-dodges-rti-commission-again/,MEPA dodges RTI Commission again,Author not found,0,2023-10-05T20:31:00+00:00," In a concerning turn of events, the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) dodged appearing before the Right to Information (RTI) Commission for the second time, when an appeal was taken up over the MEPA not providing its investigation report, on MV X-Press Pearl disaster, to the public. The report, which was completed by a 40-member expert committee and submitted by the country’s Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), details the extent of the environmental impact of the blaze that occurred on the Singapore-flagged containership X-Press Pearl, while it was anchored off the coast of Colombo on 20 May 2021. It was reported that the report was later submitted to the President. This unsettling lack of cooperation spurred the filing of an appeal under the provisions of the RTI Act No. 12 of 2016, over the MEPA’s refusal to release the said report to Ceylon Today following an RTI request. Despite being notified to appear before the RTI Commission on 3 August, the MEPA failed to appear for the hearing. Consequently, the Commission sent a follow-up notice to the MEPA and the journalist who filed the RTI request via email and registered post, instructing them to appear before the commission on 5 October. These notices were issued by the commission Chairman, retired Supreme Court Judge Upali Abeyratne. During the hearing held yesterday (5), only the journalist was present, and representatives from the MEPA were notably absent. Subsequently, the RTI Commission attempted to contact the MEPA via phone and they expressed their willingness to participate in the sessions via Zoom, thus avoiding physical attendance. Considering the MEPA’s previous avoidance of two notices, the journalist raised concerns about granting another opportunity. Section 39(1) of the RTI Act No. 12 of 2016 allows for legal action to be taken against the MEPA before a Magistrate’s Court. Retired Judge Abeyratne announced that the final decision on the appeal would be delivered on 30 November and instructed commission officials to inform the MEPA of this decision. He also stated that, in the future, officials from the MEPA would not be given the option to participate via Zoom for appeals related to Colombo and nearby areas. Furthermore, he acknowledged certain shortcomings in the issuance of notices to the MEPA and emphasised the need to rectify these issues in the future. BY Mithun Jayawardhana"

In his address at the forum, Minister of Environment, Nazeer Ahmed noted the critical importance of multilateral partnerships in addressing the ongoing global climate crisis. Minister Ahmed referenced an analysis report by Oxfam, asserting that the current global financial system has proven inadequate, with G7 countries collectively owing low- and middle-income nations a staggering USD 13.3 trillion in unpaid aid and funding for climate action. He urged all attending nations to expedite the establishment of a Climate Justice Forum, akin to an OPEC for climate justice, for climate-vulnerable and developing states in the Global South. This proposal aligns with the vision previously put forward by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the COP 27 summit last year. Minister Ahmed said, “The Climate Justice Forum (CJF), as the collective voice of climate-vulnerable nations, shall seek to rectify the unequal distribution of environmental burdens on vulnerable groups and economically disadvantaged populations and States, from landless farmers to all forms of disadvantaged communities.” Moreover, Minister Ahmed advocated for the establishment of a Biosphere Reserve Bank, a new 100% climate finance and green transition-focused Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) for the Global South. This MDB would serve as the institutional arm of the Climate Justice Forum, enhancing accountability in the pursuit of climate justice. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, delivering the keynote speech, echoed the call for nations to unite in addressing the current climate crisis. A multilateral meeting involving Sri Lanka, the Republic of Korea, Iran, Tuvalu, Nepal, Fiji, Bangladesh, Palau, Cook Islands, Samoa, and Japan was also held concurrently with the forum. Minister of Environment for Tuvalu, Ampelosa Tehulu, stressed the necessity for small island nations and other developing countries to present a unified voice when advocating for climate justice. She urged the countries, at the multilateral meeting, to prioritise efforts to find a solution to the worsening situation in Tuvalu, which faces imminent submergence due to rising sea levels caused by global warming. The Forum of Ministers and Environment Authorities of Asia-Pacific serves as a platform for governments and intergovernmental organisations to deliberate and prioritise environmental issues in the Asia-Pacific region. Its objective is to develop a comprehensive plan ahead of the sixth session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-6), scheduled from 26 February to 1 March 2024 in Nairobi. BY Buwanaka S. Perera"

During a media briefing at Sirikotha on Thursday (5), Jagoda emphasised that the President’s objections to the UNHRC resolution concerning Sri Lanka seemed reasonable to a certain section of the population. “Sri Lanka is fully capable of addressing every internal issue. Moreover, a report has been submitted to the authorities regarding the present state of children’s health and malnutrition. We possess such reports and have our own perspective on these matters. Many factions had been making baseless allegations that the Government was attempting to suppress the people by enacting oppressive laws. In reality, such laws are essential in tandem with technological advancements,” Jagoda said. The lack of proper awareness and education regarding the use of social media is a matter of concern. While allegations are being made, laws were enacted to protect the innocent and ensure the well-being of ordinary citizens, according to Jagoda. Jagoda also pointed out that European countries have included social media in their school curriculum, starting from the primary level and emphasised that the introduction of such programmes is very important for countries like Sri Lanka.

The striking guards demanded the immediate termination of the said security officer’s service, plunging the railway system into turmoil. The strike originated from an altercation between a railway deputy guard and a sergeant attached to the security at Maligawatte yard, reportedly triggered by the deputy guard’s smoking inside the Chief Engineer’s Office, Dematagoda inside the railway yard. The argument escalated, resulting in injuries to both individuals, who were subsequently admitted to the Colombo National Hospital. The strike caused widespread disruptions to train services in Sri Lanka, with over 78 train journeys cancelled in a single evening.  Many train journeys were cancelled due to controllers not reporting for duty. Commuters were left stranded at railway platforms, leading to unrest among passengers, including schoolchildren and daily commuters. Due to the limited availability of train services, passengers resorted to unsafe means of transportation, further escalating the situation. Frustrated commuters confronted station masters, leading to the suspension of ticket issuance and station operations at various locations, including Dehiwala, Bambalapitiya, and Maradana. In response to these incidents, the Sri Lanka Railway Station Masters’ Union decided to withdraw station masters from their posts for safety reasons. They also requested Police and military presence at railway stations to ensure security. SSP Nihal Thalduwa confirmed that Police were deployed to protect railway stations and maintain order. While instances of altercations were reported, there were no reports of property damage or loss of life. Measures were taken to prevent possible clashes. Additional security was deployed at several key railway stations, including Colombo Fort, Maradana, and Kompannavidiya, with preparations in place for further intervention if necessary. The sudden strike action drew criticism from other railway unions, who viewed it as an abuse of power and strongly condemned the disruption caused to passengers. They called for an urgent investigation into the incident, emphasising the severity of paralysing the entire railway service over a personal dispute between two employees. General Manager of Railways, W.A.D.S. Gunasinghe expressed concern over the disruption of public transport due to the sudden strikes. Numerous attempts to contact the Minister of Media and Transport regarding the incident were futile. It is reported that the authorities are examining CCTV footage of the incident as part of the investigation.  By Mithun Jayawardhana"

He was responding to a question from the media regarding the ongoing dialogue between the Sri Lankan Government and the IMF. MP Rajapaksa added that the Government plans to persist with raising taxes and place the burden on the public under the pretext of adhering to the IMF’s directives. He also questioned whether the public is happy with the price hikes, especially since they ousted former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, blaming him for not seeking IMF assistance sooner. Rajapaksa further claimed that his party has proposals to strengthen the rural financial system and emphasised that the present economic crisis cannot be resolved solely through taxation. When queried whether the public should trust the IMF, the MP suggested that they should place their trust in the Sri Lankan model, viewing the IMF as a supplemental aid rather than the sole solution for the crisis. However, he failed to elaborate on what exactly the “Sri Lankan model” entails. He also said President Wickremesinghe was appointed thanks to the ‘Aragalaya’ movement last year. MP Namal Rajapaksa further asserted that if Gotabaya Rajapaksa were still the President, there would not have been increases in gas prices, fuel prices, electricity prices, or taxes. He argued that if the ‘Aragalaya’ movement had not toppled the Gotabaya Rajapaksa regime, the economic situation would have improved through an organic and national mechanism. By Buwanaka S. Perera"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

He said this during a bilateral meeting with Minister of Environment Naseer Ahamed at the Shangri-La Hotel, yesterday. This meeting was part of the Fifth Forum of Ministers and Environment Authorities of Asia Pacific 2023 (5th AP Forum), which was hosted in Colombo from 3-6 October. The meeting began with formalities and recognition of longstanding diplomatic ties between the two countries. Salajegheh emphasised Iran’s challenges in dealing with the present climate crisis. He highlighted issues such as the increasing occurrence of dust storms, rising sea levels, and seawater contamination of freshwater sources in Southern Iran. These challenges have had significant adverse effects on both the Iranian population and its mangrove forests. Notably, both Sri Lanka and Iran boast substantial mangrove forest cover. In light of this, the Iranian Vice President proposed collaboration between the two nations to enhance their conservation efforts. He also extended an invitation to Sri Lankan students to pursue studies in Iranian universities to support these efforts. Vice President Salajegheh expressed gratitude for the sanctions imposed on Iran by certain “developed countries,” as they have compelled Iran to seek innovative solutions to its environmental issues. He assured continued support and technology sharing to strengthen Sri Lanka’s safety and security. In response, Minister of Environment Naseer Ahamed expressed appreciation for Iran’s continuous support, particularly during Sri Lanka’s conflict with the LTTE. Regarding the climate crisis, Minister Ahamed noted that though Sri Lanka, as a small island nation, has made a limited contribution to the issue, developed countries responsible for a significant portion of global emissions have not provided adequate support to mitigate the problems arising from their actions. He mentioned that President Ranil Wickremesinghe had called for the creation of a Climate Justice Forum at COP27 to hold developed nations accountable for their role in the crisis. Minister Ahamed acknowledged Iran’s resilience in the face of sanctions and expressed the Sri Lankan Government’s interest in sending officials to Iran for training and knowledge-sharing on more effective climate change mitigation strategies. In a gesture of further cooperation, Vice President Salajegheh extended an invitation to Minister Naseer Ahamed to visit Iran, to strengthen collaboration between the two nations in conservation efforts and addressing the climate crisis.

Dr. Aluthge said discussions should also be held with the President and the authorities to work towards retaining medical practitioners in the country. “The former President is quite aware of the value of doctors while medical professionals too had been able to maintain cordial dealings with him during his tenure as a former Minister of Health,” the GMOA Secretary added. Sirisena told the media that it was essential to resolve the present shortage of medical professionals in the State health service. A large number of State hospitals in rural areas were being closed as a result. “There is information that at least 20 to 25 rural hospitals had been closed due to the shortage of doctors.

Gak said, “One of the biggest stories was the Channel 4 report on the Easter Sunday attacks and the revelation on the ‘presumed collusion’ of members of the State with the terrorist group, which is one of the worst events in the Easter bombing.” The President responded saying, “Why do you treat Channel 4 as sacred?” Gak responded, “I don’t, actually I don’t,” and the President interrupted saying that lots of people in Britain don’t take Channel 4 seriously. Gak then said, “Do you flatly deny Channel 4?” and the President interrupted, “No no, why are you only asking about Channel 4” to which Gak said, “I am not asking about Channel 4 but I am asking if these are concrete accusations.” The President responded, “Just because a media makes an accusation, why should I?” The President added, “The former Attorney General has made an accusation, a former DIG has made accusations, why are you asking only about that. Ask me about all of that.” Gak then said, “It is not only Channel 4 but the Catholic church as well that is asking for an investigation and about the former President under whom you served.  The President then said, “I am asking you. You did not ask me that at first and it was when I pressed you, that you asked me about the former President asking for an investigation. You came with the Channel 4 report as gospel truth.” The President then clarified that firstly, he had appointed a committee headed by a judge, and comprising the former Commander of the Air Force and a renowned lawyer. When the President wanted to explain the second part of it, Gak said, “Nobody would believe that these commissions have teeth enough to do anything” and the President responded, “That is your view and not mine.”  Gak said the Cardinal wanted an investigation and the President quipped, “I am dealing with the Bishops’ Conference and not with the Cardinal. And the Bishops Conference wanted all the proceedings of the Commission and I gave it. I gave the final report to the Bishop’s Conference.” Gak said they are looking for an independent investigation. The President then said, “I deal with the Bishops’ Conference and they come to meet me and not you. You sit here with a piece of paper. I talked to the Bishops’ Conference and I will talk to them after I return. I have nothing. I am not involved in anything and I want to resolve it and you take a piece of paper about the Cardinal. Have you spoken to the Bishops’ Conference?” Gak replied in the negative. “Then you don’t have the right to ask me this question,” the President said. Gak said he was posting questions in the public interest to which President Wickremesinghe said, “I am in the public interest asking you, who are you?” The President said, “You did not come to question me but to corner me that the Government is not doing anything. You take this western attitude out. You are doing it.” Gak said several people have requested internationally aided independent investigations on the Easter bombings. The President said, “The Sri Lankan Government does not have international inquiries, full stop. The FBI report said no outsiders were involved,” noted the President. Gak queried, “Do you realise that this makes you look like paying lip service to reconciliation.” The President then said, “If the FBI, UK, Australia, India and Chinese secret service have given their reports then what are you saying? What I can say is you are talking nonsense.” Gak responding said, “You can answer whatever way you want but let me ask the questions.” The President retorted, “I am telling you, don’t come and accuse me. Look, I have been in this game long before you. I think that the western media thinks that we are bad. We are not going to have any international inquiries on any issues. The UK hasn’t got. Germany hasn’t got. Why should we poor Sri Lankans and Asians need to have?  You think we are second class?” Gak said, “I don’t but because you have a history of commissions from 2008 at least,” and the President said “If you think we are a third grade country you have got it wrong.” Gak asked about the Save the Children report on hunger in the country and the President immediately responded saying he had read that report. “I am not saying I did not. We may not agree on the figures but there is hunger and I am not saying no to it.” The President said, “To only to accuse us on hunger is not right,” but Gak interrupted saying “There is a difference in times that the State has to solve its problem and the time that a parent needs to feed a child. Do you agree?” President Wickremesinghe responding said, “Can you fulfil that in one when the economy collapses and in not even a year now, that hunger and poverty is down.” The President said, “It is a transition period. We did not say there is no hunger. We say there is hunger and that is why I took over the presidency to finish off the hunger.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Subject to the provisions of Section 6, the Commission shall consist of five members appointed by the President and the term of office of a member of the Commission shall be three years from the date of appointment.

Minister Alles responding said, “This Bill was introduced for the first time in 2016 when you (then government) were in power. We are presenting it today with minor amendments.” At this juncture, Prof G.L. Peiris said the Bill was included in the Order Paper on 27 September. According to the Constitution, the public can challenge a Bill within 14 days since it is published in the Order Paper. But after 27 September, there was a long weekend of four days. As a result, the public only had seven working days to go to Court. I will also go to the Supreme Court. I’m not pointing fingers at anyone here.

Responding to a query raised by the media, Rajapaksa said, neither he nor his father had received any electricity bill. According to Rajapaksa, the bill that was paid by Nishantha, had been forwarded to the President’s Security Division (PSD). “This is now becoming a scandal. However, that chapter is now closed,” said Rajapaksa who further stated that the people who are trying to slander his and his family name can finally rest, given that the bill is finally settled and they should invest their time to find a new topic to talk about. The CEB, in response to a Right to Information (RTI) request of former JVP Provincial Councillor Nalin Hewage, recently revealed that an outstanding electricity bill of Rs 2,682,246.57 was due for the Weeraketiya house, relating to the provision of security lights and generators for an event that took place between 12 and 15 September 2019. The CEB said they had installed security lights and generators for the mentioned function at the Weeraketiya house, on being informed that former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was to attend a function on the said dates. The CEB further said, despite providing the services and incurring the electricity charges of Rs 2,682,246.57, the payment had not been settled even after four years, although multiple requests had been made for it to be settled. After the CEB’s response to Hewage’s RTI request went viral on social media, Namal Rajapaksa took action and sent a letter to the CEB. In the letter, he requested detailed information regarding the unpaid bill. Specifically, he asked for the recipient’s name to whom the bill was issued, the amount of the bill, the date when the bill was issued and the address to which the bill was sent. BY Buwanaka S.

Addressing Parliament yesterday (3), Rajapakshe said discussions would be initiated to ask the IMF to reconsider this request. He explained to Parliament that the IMF had advised the Government to increase tax revenue to a certain extent by the end of the first quarter of the following year. Rajapakshe emphasised that increasing tax revenue would necessitate raising tax percentages, but the Government has expressed its concern about imposing additional tax burdens on the people at this time. In response to a question raised by Opposition MPs regarding the delay in the IMF’s second tranche, the Minister said it is not a matter of failing to meet IMF conditions but rather a matter of the Government’s reluctance to further tax the population. The Minister further disclosed that the forthcoming discussions with the IMF will focus on appealing for a reconsideration of their request to increase tax revenue. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

Addressing Parliament, the Minister said the NWSDB faces understaffing in certain areas while dealing with overstaffing in others. “There is a need to address the excessive political appointments in the ministry. Around 70 per cent of the labour force in the ministry lack the requisite skills and this has caused a staffing imbalance within the NWSDB,” he said. These revelations were in response to a question about the ministry’s ability to hire labourers directly for pipe installations, a concern raised due to issues faced by labourers regarding their wages when employed through contractors. Thondaman said granting permanent appointments in such a context is not feasible, considering the ministry’s current financial commitments. Before the recent water tariff hike, the ministry faced its first-rate increase in a decade. There is a significant monthly expense related to electricity and loan repayments, he pointed out.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/04/copf-instructs-audit-dept-to-calculate-wheat-flour-availability/,COPF instructs Audit Dept to calculate wheat flour availability,Author not found,0,2023-10-03T20:33:00+00:00,"Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance (COPF), Dr. Harsha de Silva, instructed the Auditor General’s Department to calculate the quantity of wheat flour currently available in Sri Lanka’s warehouses and submit an audit report pertaining to wheat flour within two months. The Parliamentarian was of the view that if there is a pricing formula for wheat flour too, it will leave no room for individual parties to decide on the prices according to their wishes. This was discussed when the Committee on Public Finance met recently under the Chairmanship of Dr. de Silva. The Members of the Committee pointed out that wheat flour is being sold at different prices in shops all over Sri Lanka. However, according to the prices given by the Ministry of Finance, one kilo of wheat flour can be sold at Rs 198. The Chair emphasised that two price calculations are being used in setting the price of wheat flour and this should be changed. Although the price has increased due to the increase in the tax imposed on wheat flour, the Chair told the officials that the increased tax has increased the price of the wheat flour that was already in the warehouses of the country. Recalling the efforts made to prepare a price formula for gas and milk powder last season, the chairman pointed out the dire need of a price formula for regulating the price of wheat. The Committee emphasised that a price formula should be prepared immediately in order to work in a more diversified manner. Furthermore, under the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, the Committee on Public Finance approved the reduction of taxes on many other goods. It was approved when the Resolution under the Customs Ordinance, published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2338/54, was discussed on 30 June. Under that, it was proposed to reduce the tax rate which was 15% to five per cent. Granting approval for that, the Committee questioned the officials regarding the benefits of this trade agreement. However, the officials responding, stated that it was not possible to conduct a feasibility study. Expressing his displeasure, the Chair instructed the chief officer in charge of the Singapore-SriLanka Free Trade Agreement to submit a report to the Committee within six weeks, presenting logical facts about the agreement. Resolutions under the Customs Ordinance, published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2336/72 on 16 June 2023 were further reviewed for a second time. However, the Committee decided not to approve the proposal made through this Gazette. Here, the officials presented a proposal to change the HS code related to the import of raw materials required for soap production. The Committee questioned whether there will be an increase in tax rates on the import of the relevant raw materials. Accordingly, the Chair pointed out that it is questionable that one group of the government requests for approval to reduce tax and another group requests increased taxes. In the year 2021, it was revealed to the Committee that no new investment had been made during that period, even though the tax charges had been reduced in the import of raw materials required for soap production. Accordingly, Dr. de Silva instructed the concerned officials to conduct discussions, under the leadership of the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and formulate a policy on tax revision and submit it to the COPF."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/04/who-recommends-new-vaccine-to-prevent-malaria-in-children/,WHO recommends new vaccine to prevent malaria in children,Author not found,0,2023-10-03T20:33:00+00:00,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended a new vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, to prevent malaria in children. The recommendation follows advice from the WHO: Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) and the Malaria Policy Advisory Group (MPAG) and has been endorsed by the Director-General of the WHO following its regular biannual meeting held from 25-29 September. The R21 vaccine is the second malaria vaccine recommended by the WHO following the RTS, S/AS01 vaccine, which received a WHO recommendation in 2021. Both vaccines are shown to be safe and effective in preventing malaria in children and when implemented broadly, are expected to have high public health impact. Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, places a particularly high burden on children in the African Region, where nearly half a million children die from the disease each year. Demand for malaria vaccines is unprecedented; however, available supply of RTS, S is limited.  The addition of R21 to the list of WHO-recommended malaria vaccines is expected to result in sufficient vaccine supply to benefit all children living in areas where malaria is a public health risk.  The updated WHO malaria vaccine recommendation is informed by evidence from an ongoing R21 vaccine clinical trial and other studies, which showed: High efficacy when given just before the high transmission season: In areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission (where malaria transmission is largely limited to four or five months per year), the R21 vaccine was shown to reduce symptomatic cases of malaria by 75% during the 12 months following a 3-dose series. A fourth dose given a year after the third maintained efficacy. This high efficacy is similar to the efficacy demonstrated when RTS,S is given seasonally.  Good efficacy when given in an age-based schedule:  The vaccine showed good efficacy (66%) during the 12 months following the first three doses. A fourth dose a year after the third maintained efficacy. High impact: Mathematical modelling estimates indicate the public health impact of the R21 vaccine is expected to be high in a wide range of malaria transmission settings, including low transmission settings. Similarity of R21 and RTS, S vaccines: The two WHO-recommended vaccines, R21 and RTS, S, have not been tested in a head-to-head trial. There is no evidence to date showing one vaccine performs better than the other. The choice of product to be used in a country should be based on programmatic characteristics, vaccine supply, and vaccine affordability Safety: The R21 vaccine was shown to be safe in clinical trials. As with other new vaccines, safety monitoring will continue. Next steps for the second recommended malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, include completing the ongoing WHO prequalification which would enable international procurement of the vaccine for broader rollout. At least 28 countries in Africa plan to introduce a WHO-recommended malaria vaccine as part of their national immunisation programmes. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance has approved providing technical and financial support to roll out malaria vaccines to 18 countries. The RTS, S vaccine will be rolled out in some African countries in early 2024, and the R21 malaria vaccine is expected to become available to countries mid-2024.  WHO also issued recommendations on the advice of SAGE for new vaccines for dengue and meningitis. Dengue poses a major public health burden in endemic countries will increase further both in terms of incidence and geographic expansion, due to climate change and urbanisation. The live-attenuated quadrivalent dengue vaccine developed by Takeda (TAK-003) has demonstrated efficacy against all four serotypes of the virus in baseline seropositive children (4-16 years) in endemic countries and against serotypes one and two in baseline seronegative children. SAGE recommended that the vaccine be considered for introduction in settings with high dengue disease burden and high transmission intensity to maximise the public health impact and minimise any potential risk in seronegative persons.  SAGE recommended that the vaccine be introduced to children aged six to 16 years of age. Within this age range, the vaccine should be introduced about 1-2 years prior to the age-specific peak incidence of dengue-related hospitalisations. The vaccine should be administered in two doses schedule with a three-month interval between doses. SAGE recommended that vaccine introduction should be accompanied by a well-designed communication strategy and community engagement."

He also cautioned health authorities to be vigilant as those blacklisted medicinal drug companies could recommence importation of pharmaceuticals under different company names as has been done in the past.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Opposition Leader, Ratnapriya claimed, often seemed indecisive and driven by his own agenda, described as ‘Aasai Bayai – Keen but reluctant’. Instances from his political history highlighted this tendency, including his hesitance to take charge when an opportunity arose over the post of President during Aragalaya and when the presidential post became vacant after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s resignation. Ratnapriya alleged that both Premadasa and Dissanayake were misinterpreting the proposed Online Safety Bill to serve their political ambitions, making baseless statements in public and media and misleading the general public. Furthermore, Ratnapriya criticised Premadasa for using the IMF programme to gain political leverage, implying that his motivations were driven by a desire for power rather than genuine concern for the nation. Ratnapriya criticised Dissanayake over his inconsistent stance on IMF dealings, suggesting a lack of common sense in the latter’s approach.

The protest took place at the heart of Konwewa town due to the lack of maintenance on approximately one kilometre of the Konwewa – Dembatawewa main road. Additionally, the ongoing issue of elephants wandering into the village added to the community’s frustrations. The main road serves more than 2,000 residents across 28 villages in Dembatawewa and Konwewa. Unfortunately, a roughly one-kilometre stretch near Yanoya has suffered severe deterioration due to a decade of neglect. During the rainy season, the road becomes inundated, halting all movement, forcing locals to use boats for transportation. In response to this problem, the people of the area and the local monks organised a protest. They demanded a permanent solution, emphasising that the authorities had been informed about this issue for ten years but had not taken any action.

The campaign will be conducted by a team of 10 global influencers with followers from top tourism source markets, including: the UK, India, France, Germany, Poland, Scandinavia, Canada and the United States. The team will travel to many exotic locations around the country to showcase a range of sustainable niche tourism products and experiential cultural attractions that Sri Lanka has to offer to attract more visitors to the country. Tourism is critical to Sri Lanka’s economy as it exits the pandemic and deals with its internal economic crisis. Pre-pandemic tourism represented 12 per cent of the country’s GDP, generating USD 4.3 billion in revenue in 2018. Sri Lanka is currently experiencing an encouraging surge in tourist arrivals and on Tuesday 26th September, crossed the crucial landmark of One million tourists for the year 2023 – easily surpassing the total of 720,000 recorded for the whole of 2022. The landmark also coincided with the celebration of World Tourism Day on 27 September. “The increase in tourist arrivals this year in Sri Lanka is very encouraging,” said Chief Guest, Julie Chung, Ambassador of the United States to Sri Lanka, at the special launch event held on Monday 25th September at Cinnamon Grand Hotel.  The Ambassador added, “It shows that Sri Lanka is again ready to realise its full potential as a global tourist destination, following years of downturn due to the Covid pandemic and the economic crisis.  I am particularly pleased that USAID is engaged in this important sector and that we are supporting Sri Lanka’s return to economic stability.  With the United States having worked side-by-side with Sri Lanka for 75 years, this is what a strong partnership looks like.” Using social media influencer campaigns has become a popular strategy for brands and organisations globally to communicate their messages, products, or services to a broader and more engaged audience. USAID has successfully sponsored social media influencer campaigns in Georgia and, most recently, Nepal. Theses campaigns are especially useful to target specific markets (eg. UK, Germany, India, etc.) as well as certain interests (Adventure, Culture, Wellness etc.). USAID launched the Indo Pacific Opportunity Project (IPOP) tourism activity in July 2022 to support economic reforms and promote foreign direct investment in Sri Lanka.  The two-year project is assisting the Sri Lanka Tourism Ministry to streamline and implement new policies and procedures to enable fast-tracking and attraction of foreign direct investment in the tourism sector. The launch of this social media influencer campaign is another step forward in USAID-IPOP’s strategy to boost Sri Lanka’s tourism."

However, the officials from the management had insisted that the delays had occurred due to the ‘workto rule’ campaign launched by the trade unions. The Ministers had then pointed out that 260 pilots have been deployed for service in 21 aircraft and that for one aircraft at least 12 pilots should be on duty. He had then noted that according to internationally accepted calculations, a pilot should put in at least 100 hours of service per month and that during the past month pilots of the national carrier had only done 60 hours. The Minister had stated that if a pilot had put in at least 80 hours of service then such delays could have been overcome. He had then accepted that there was an issue related to salaries of the national carrier and that SriLankan has been forced to pay a sum of USD 1.2 billion as loans and interest. However, he added that if the national carrier were to return dividends then a performance based-incentive could be given after consideration. He further stated that the fifth freedom right would be given to other airline operators shortly. According to Wijeyapathirana, the aviation engineers who were on duty had effectively implemented a “work-to-rule” agenda without formally declaring it to the management. He expressed disappointment, stating that this action was not planned by them. Furthermore, he alleged that when questioned, the engineers mentioned that they deliberately delayed repairing a technical issue with the aircraft. Wijeyapathirana explained that the JNSS has a significant membership of 70 per cent in SriLankan. He alleged that aviation engineers had “slowed down” their duties, resulting in delays that led to the transfer of passengers from UL (SriLankan Airlines) to other available flights and that also led to cancellations. This situation also led to the necessity of providing food and lodging in hotels due to the delays and cancellation of the flights. Reportedly, approximately 150 aviation engineers had been requesting a productivity allowance for the past six months. It had been granted to cabin crews but not to them. It is worth noting that other service providers within SriLankan might also demand similar allowances, but as a major loss-making entity, SriLankan cannot afford to provide such allowances. The JNSS President clarified that the technical issue in question was related to routing check-ups and did not compromise the safety of the aircraft. On 1 October,  UL181 faced a cancellation situation, causing a commotion at the airport, when passengers had already been seated in the aircraft for three hours. This flight was originally scheduled to depart for Katmandu, Nepal, from the Bandaranaike International Airport at 8:20 a.m. but had to be cancelled due to a mechanical issue. Simultaneously, on the same day, another SriLankan Airlines flight, bound for Mumbai, India, was also called off due to a technical problem affecting the aircraft. These cancellations inconvenienced hundreds of passengers, disrupting their travel plans and causing unexpected delays. SriLankan Airlines then had to take measures to assist affected passengers by offering alternative arrangements. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in May this year, said SriLankan Airlines has had a total loss of Rs 372 billion by 31 March 2021. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

He made this announcement during a press briefing at the President’s Media Centre (PMC). Herath added that the eRL 2.0 programme will be rolled out in all provinces except the Western. What sets the eRL 2.0 system apart is its convenience, allowing citizens to obtain motor vehicle revenue licences from the comfort of their homes. This digital transformation initiative is aligned with President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s vision to digitise all government institutions in Sri Lanka, as outlined in the budget 2023 statement. To kickstart the digitisation process, nine pilot projects are currently underway, involving various government institutions, including Divisional Secretariat Divisions, Pradeshiya Sabhas, Municipal Councils and District Secretariat Offices. These efforts aim to enhance efficiency and transparency within the public service, the State minister revealed. Starting on 7 October, the eRL 2.0 system will offer residents the option to acquire vehicle revenue licences online. It is a collaborative effort between the State Ministry of Technology and the Information and Communication Technology Association of Sri Lanka. It will initially cover all provinces, excluding the Western Province, with plans to expand to all government institutions and enable online payments by March of the following year."

Professors Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman will share the prize. The technology was experimental before the pandemic, but has now been given to millions of people around the world to protect them against serious Covid-19. The same mRNA technology is now being researched for other diseases, including cancer. The Nobel Prize committee said: “The laureates contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times.” Both were told they had won by telephone this morning and were said to be “overwhelmed”. Vaccines train the immune system to recognise and fight threats such as viruses or bacteria. Traditional vaccine technology has been based on dead or weakened versions of the original virus or bacterium – or by using fragments of the infectious agent. In contrast, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines use a completely differently approach. During the Covid pandemic, the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were both based on mRNA technology. Professor Kariko and Professor Weissman met in the early 1990s when they were working at the University of Pennsylvania, in the United States, when their interest in mRNA was seen as a scientific backwater. An mRNA Covid vaccine contains the genetic instructions for building one component – a protein – from the coronavirus. When this is injected into the body, our cells start producing lots of the viral protein. The immune system recognises these as foreign so it attacks and has learned how to fight the virus, and therefore has a head start when future infections occur. The big idea behind the technology is that you can rapidly develop a vaccine against almost anything – as long as you know the right genetic instructions to use. This makes it far faster and more flexible than traditional approaches to vaccine development. There are even experimental approaches using the technology that are teaching patients’ bodies how to fight their own cancers. Scientists analyse a patient’s tumour, look for abnormal proteins being produced by the cancer that are not in healthy tissue and develop a vaccine to target those and inject that into the patient. Profs Kariko and Weissman made the crucial breakthroughs that made mRNA vaccines happen. The principle taps into normal human biology. RNA’s role in our body is to convert the instructions that are locked away in our genetic code, or DNA, into the proteins that our body is built from. However, there were challenges. But by refining the technology, the researchers were able to produce large amounts of the intended protein without causing dangerous levels of inflammation that had been seen in animal experiments. This paved the way for developing the vaccine technology for use in people. Katalin Kariko is now a professor at Szeged University in Hungary and Drew Weissman is still working as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. (BBC)"

Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe added that every day we watch on social media and television, wars in different parts of the world and we realise the extent of the destruction and devastation that wars leave. The solutions are not easy, but we can begin with ourselves, first be at peace with yourself, strive for peace in your homes with love and harmony among all your family members and from yourself, own self, and your family, it will transcend to society, city, nations and the whole world. Instead of ‘be the Change’, ‘I am the Change’ is the slogan of this year’s Global Youth Peace Fest, introducing the same Dr. PV Rajgopal said youth have to replace the present-day business of wars and violence of powerful countries and big corporates with a strong belief in power of self and mantra of non-violence which Mahatma Gandhi propagated, lived anddied for. American Gandhi Don McAvinchey asked the participating young people to ask themselves, what is there in the world, they’d like to live for and change for a better world. The majority of the population in the world is young people and they have to unite through such endeavours bridging the gaps of religion, race, gender and nationalities. Prominent participating dignitaries also presented 15 promising international young delegates of the Global Youth Peace Fest with the ‘Youth Leadership Awards’. Participating young delegates who came for the programme are from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Malaysia, Australia, the USA, Egypt, Uganda, Sudan, Nepal, the Maldives, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. ‘Day 1’  of the programme ended with a ‘Bridge the Gap March for Girls and Women’s Rights’, from Town Hall to Independence Square: In which the participants were carrying posters with slogans like ‘Stand for Women’s Rights’, ‘Close the Gap’, ‘Women’s Wave Rising’, ‘Women Rights are Human Rights’ etc. and in the end, lighting candles they pledged to work promoting the rights and dignity of girls and women. Thanking the participating young people who joined the march, Pramod Sharma, Founder, Yuvsatta (youth for peace) informed that in 86 countries, women face some form of job restriction and 95 countries do not guarantee ‘equal pay for equal work’. Women and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-Gender equality is a right. Fulfilling this right is the best chance we have in meeting some of the most pressing challenges of our time—from economic crisis and lack of health care to climate change, violence against women and escalating conflicts. Tomorrow the second day of the programme will start with an early morning Colombo Beach cleanliness drive at Galleface Beach and later full-day interactive workshops at headquarters of the biggest NGO in Sri Lanka, the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

The officer was later released on surety bail in Rs100,000. The incident has occurred at around 3:30a.m. on Saturday. Following the end of the perahera, the mahout had tethered Sita to a tree on the banks of the Mahaweli River, next to the temple complex to have some breakfast. According to a statement made by the Director General of the Department of Wildlife and Conservation (DWC) Chandana Sooriyabandara, the area where the incident took place is prone to wild elephant encounters and the officer had mistaken the elephant as a wild elephant and had shot it to drive it away. According to the mahout, despite the people around, informing the officer that the elephant he was aiming to shoot was a tame elephant, the officer continued to shoot in the belief that it was a wild elephant. The DWC said the elephant was treated by a veterinary surgeon from the department following the incident. Speaking to Ceylon Today, Panchali Panapitiya, founder of the animal rights advocacy organisation, RARE Sri Lanka, said the excuse trotted out for the shooting by the e DWC was unacceptable. “How is it okay to shoot an elephant whether it be from the wild or not?” Highlighting the injuries to Sita, Panapitiya said there were over seven wounds inflicted on Sita following the incident. She also stated that captive elephants must be kept away from wild elephants for their safety. The area in question being prone to constant human and wild elephant conflicts, the DWC must be more aware and careful with how they address a wild elephant encounter. Panapitiya said being tethered to a tree, the elephant couldn’t even flee the area. She also alleged that the DWC isn’t trained enough to handle such a situation and that there should be more security to ensure the safety of captive elephants. According to Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa, the true intent of the CSD officer is yet to be ascertained as he has acted on his own accord and not on any orders to carry out the shooting. SSP Thalduwa told Ceylon Today that due to vehicles being parked in front of the temple, mahouts tether elephants on the river bank. Responding to the question on the legality of shooting an elephant, SSP Thalduwa said the DWC has a  process they implement to de-escalate a human- elephant conflict and that shooting at an elephant was the last resortDWC officers should engage in. Only if the elephant becomes an immediate threat to human lives and property in the immediate vicinity, should the elephant be shot at. The CSD has commenced an internal disciplinary investigation against the officer in question.

Flight UL-180 scheduled to depart for Kathmandu, Nepal, at 8:20 a.m. was delayed and over 200 passengers were stranded including State Minister Sisira Jayakody. Passengers boarded the flight at 7:15 a.m., but the plane remained grounded at the BIA until 11:00 a.m. Subsequently, it was announced that another aircraft would be provided due to technical issues in the original plane. However, as the afternoon rolled on, this promise remained unfulfilled, leading to growing frustration among passengers, including Minister Jayakody. The delay was attributed to the challenging topography of Nepal, known for its mountainous terrain and frequent fog, particularly in the evening, which hindered takeoff. Airport sources said due to these conditions, the flight was cancelled. Jayakody expressed his concerns and said the Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva has to bear the responsibility. He said a number of foreign tourists, including himself, were inconvenienced by the delay. Airport authorities, when queried about the delay cited action taken by technical officers and trade unions as contributing factors. He assured passengers that efforts were underway to secure an alternative aircraft for the affected flight. Meanwhile, another flight which was bound for Mumbai, in India in the morning, had also been cancelled due to a technical issue with the aircraft. Following the cancellations passengers for the two flights were directed to hotels, an airline spokesman said. Moreover, it is reported that other flights scheduled to arrive at BIA from destinations such as Trivandrum in India, Male in the Maldives, Chennai in India, Dhaka in Bangladesh, and Narita in Japan also experienced delays.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Minister’s compelling speech highlighted the pressing challenges and opportunities facing trade unions in the ever-evolving landscape of work. Minister Thondaman acknowledged the historical significance of trade unions in advocating for workers’ rights, fair wages, and safe working conditions. However, he said challenges confronting today’s workforce are unprecedented, driven by automation, artificial intelligence, and the gig economy, necessitating innovative adaptation by trade unions. A key highlight of Minister Thondaman’s speech was his impassioned call for South Asian trade unions to harness the power of technology to empower workers. He emphasised that they “must leverage technology to connect with workers across various sectors, ensuring their voices are heard.” Further, the Minister stressed that achieving diversity and inclusivity within trade unions themselves is essential to represent the diverse workforce of the region effectively. He reiterated that trade unions “should strive for diversity and inclusivity within” to stand up for the rights of all workers, regardless of their background or occupation. Minister Thondaman also recognised the global nature of the economy and emphasised the need for collaboration and solidarity among trade unions across borders. He called for trade unions to work together across borders and industries to “create a stronger, more unified voice for workers’ rights on the global stage.” The Minister’s words resonate as a call to unite and amplify the collective power of workers worldwide. Addressing specific concerns in Sri Lanka, Minister Thondaman touched on issues faced by tea estate workers, many of whom have been impacted by the lack of adequate legal protection. He also acknowledged the lack of protection for South Asian migrant labour, highlighting the pressing need for action and reform. Minister Thondaman stressed the need to address the skills gap among young workers. He asserted the skills shortage among young individuals and the importance of investing in education and training to empower the workforce of the future."

The AMS called for the uninterrupted service of SLMC members during their full five-year term to ensure the council’s independence and efficiency. The AMS highlighted past instances where members of the SLMC, including a President, were removed from their positions prematurely, leading to ongoing legal disputes. While refraining from commenting on the Minister’s power to remove members before their term ends, the AMS emphasised the adverse consequences of such actions. One such removal that drew attention was that of Professor Jayantha Jayawardena, who was terminated within less than a year of his appointment, despite being expected to serve a full five-year term. Prof. Jayawardena, who had a distinguished career as a medical academic, had made significant contributions to the SLMC during his tenure. He held various key positions within the council, including Vice President and Chairman of several committees. The AMS warned that frequent turnover of SLMC members, especially those holding crucial positions, could disrupt its operations, leading to delays in decision-making and potentially compromising its independence. It further stressed that members might withhold their views due to uncertainty about their positions within the council. The AMS also raised concerns about the removal of Prof. Jayawardena, who had recently exposed significant payments made from SLMC funds to certain parties. It called for impartial inquiries into allegations against appointed members rather than abrupt terminations without due process, emphasizing the importance of adhering to principles of natural justice. In a letter to Prof. Jayawardena, it was stated that restructuring of the SLMC was planned. The AMS questioned why he was singled out for termination when other appointees, including the President of the SLMC, remained in their positions. The AMS firmly opposed any attempts to compromise the independence and autonomy of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, especially at a time when the country’s healthcare system is facing challenges such as medication shortages, quality issues with drugs, and a scarcity of healthcare professionals."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/29/six-jumbos-killed-by-trains-in-36-hours/,Six Jumbos Killed by Trains in 36 Hours,Author not found,0,2023-09-28T20:36:00+00:00," In a tragic turn of events, six elephants, including four juveniles below the age of five, died in two train accidents which occurred within a period of 36 hours, up to 12:00 midnight on Wednesday (27). The elephants died in Galgamuwa and Habarana after colliding with the Colombo-Kankesanthurai train and the Colombo-Batticaloa train, respectively. The first incident occurred around midnight, where a night mail train travelling from Colombo to Kankesanthurai collided with four elephants near Galgamuwa. Additionally, in a separate incident that took place at approximately 12:30 a.m. yesterday, a female tusker and an elephant calf collided with the ‘Meenagaya’ train on its journey from Batticaloa to Colombo. Regrettably, the elephant calf succumbed to its injuries immediately following the collision, while the injured female tusker passed away later in the day. The local wildlife authorities from the Galgamuwa and Ritigala Wildlife Offices were conducting investigations to gain further insights into these distressing incidents. The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC), in response to questions regarding elephant deaths caused by train collisions, explained their collaborative efforts with the Ministry for Wildlife and Forest Reserve Conservation and Sri Lanka Railways. This cooperation was initiated after a similar collision in 2008 resulted in the tragic deaths of four elephants in Galgamuwa. To prevent such accidents, various measures have been proposed, including widening the clearing area on both sides of railway lines, avoiding the use of horns, reducing train speeds in elephant corridors and forested areas, and constructing underground passes. These collisions tend to occur more frequently during times when elephants venture out of the forests in search of harvested crops, particularly in proximity to the paddy harvesting season, a senior official at the department said. Despite some initiatives, such as a text message alert system for train drivers to be notified of elephant movements, being in place under the auspices of Sri Lanka Railways since last year, it has become defunct due to the ongoing economic crisis. Meanwhile, Hemantha Withanage, the Executive Director at the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ), expressed concerns that many of the proposed mitigation plans have either not been implemented or have been abandoned. He suggested that an elevated railway track on pillars, which wouldn’t obstruct train or elephant movements, would be the most effective solution. According to Withanage, the high number of elephant casualties in train collisions is primarily due to reckless conduct by train operators and he criticised the Railways Department for not maintaining consistency in prioritising a solution to this problem, particularly in relation to initiatives like the text alert system. In response to these challenges, Minister for Transport and Highways, Bandula Gunawardena, requested the public to report elephant sightings near railway tracks by calling the hotline 1971. However, when tested by Ceylon Today, the response was unsatisfactory, as the call was redirected to contact the relevant railway station. Ceylon Today also attempted to reach out to both Minister Bandula Gunawardena and Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi, who is responsible for Wildlife and Forest Reserve Conservation. Unfortunately, both ministers were unavailable for comment on the steps taken to prevent elephant-train collisions, emphasising the urgency of addressing this critical issue. According to the government data, between 2019 and 2022 there have been 1,549 elephant deaths in Sri Lanka, with at least one elephant death recorded on an average during the first quarter of 2023.

In his address, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the dual challenges of climate change mitigation and debt restructuring that the country must navigate, all while having limited funds at its disposal. He drew attention to the tumultuous nature of the global economy over the past two decades, which included crises like the European debt crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, economic shocks stemming from it and the pressing issue of climate change funding alongside sovereign debt concerns. President Wickremesinghe noted, “I don’t think we have gone through this type of crisis in any other period of modern history. And, in all these instances, it is the developing economies and the Global South that has suffered disproportionately.” The President underscored current economic challenges, such as high inflation in advanced economies, rising oil prices nearing USD 100 per barrel and global Central Banks tightening their monetary policies. He cited the lack of growth in Sri Lanka’s exports to Europe this year as a clear indication of the challenges the country faces during its recovery. He also highlighted the disparity between advanced economies and developing nations in terms of financial buffers and reserves to deal with shocks, emphasising that the latter typically lacks such resources. This disparity often leads to sovereign debt crises, as it did in Sri Lanka. In this context, President Wickremesinghe cautioned that the world may be on the brink of another crisis if immediate corrective measures are not taken. Regarding the debt restructuring efforts, he mentioned that Sri Lanka has been in positive discussions with China and needs to engage with the Paris Club and India once again. President Wickremesinghe concluded by highlighting the importance of international cooperation and financing to address the pressing challenges, particularly for developing countries. He commended Germany for its contributions to the Green Climate Fund and stressed the urgency of addressing climate change and debt restructuring with the limited available resources. He stated, “The funding on the table is woefully inadequate to address the vast challenges at hand. So, we haven’t got any money, but we do have USD 100 billion with the IMF. Let’s start with that money. USD 100 billion is better than nothing. Then let’s see how we can raise the rest of it.” President Wickremesinghe also expressed concern for the greater financing needs of African countries, particularly those with lower incomes, highlighting their unique challenges and requirements."

Speaking to the media following an event held in the Dehiowita on Wednesday (27), Siyambalapitiya explained that the earlier revision had allowed the importation of 10-year-old vehicles by lifting restrictions on buses and trucks used for public transportation services. However, based on insights provided by industry experts, it became evident that despite the lower initial prices of these 10-year-old vehicles, their maintenance, spare parts, and fuel costs are comparatively high as a result, there is a need for a reconsideration of this policy. He clarified that those who have already initiated the process by issuing Letters of Credit (LCs) during the validity period of the previous circular, which was until 14 September, will still be allowed to import vehicles in accordance with the existing regulations. Furthermore, he pointed out that a new circular would be promptly issued to ensure that it comes into effect at an appropriate time for the importation of buses and trucks into Sri Lanka, without incurring unnecessary maintenance, spare parts and fuel costs. Minister of State for Finance Dr. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says that in the next few days, the circular that was issued relaxing the import restrictions especially for buses and lorries used for public transport will be revised again. The Minister stated this, while speaking to the media after a programme held in Dehiowita area yesterday evening. Speaking there, the minister said, by removing the import restrictions imposed on buses and trucks used for public transport services, the import of 10-year-old vehicles was allowed. But according to the facts presented by the experts in the field, although the prices of 10-year-old vehicles are low, the cost of maintenance, the cost of spare parts and the cost of fuel are relatively high so, the minister said that it had to be reconsidered. However, the minister said, since the previously issued circular was valid until the 14th, those who have issued letters of credit during that period will be allowed to import vehicles according to the existing circular. Also, the Minister emphasised that the new circular will be issued very quickly so, that it will be effective at a suitable time for the import of buses and trucks to Sri Lanka without incurring unnecessary maintenance costs, unnecessary spare parts costs and unnecessary fuel costs.

While addressing a media awareness workshop hosted by the National Council for Road Safety at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI), titled ‘Rapidly increasing road accidents’, Prof. Dharmaratne said the number of deaths due to road accidents were on the rise and had exceeded the number of lives lost during the 30-year war in Sri Lanka. He said the Government spends a hefty Rs 1.8 billion to treat those injured in road accidents and added that road accidents had claimed 24,786 lives from 2016 to 2018 in Sri Lanka and 20,000 people had been injured during the same period. “Road accidents had claimed many lives on the spot and have left many young men disabled for life. Among them were motorcyclists, pedestrians and cyclists and represent more than 60 per cent of accident victims. Approximately seven to eight people lose their lives on a daily basis in road accidents,” Prof. Dharmaratne added. Setting up a Task Force to prevent road traffic accidents was a prime concern today, he pointed out. He also said there was an absolute need to implement traffic rules to reduce the spate of accidents and the number of people falling victim and some of them being maimed for life. He said if traffic rules were properly implemented accidents, could be reduced at least by 10 per cent.  “Unfortunately, many of the casualties were those in their youth, resulting in the country losing invaluable human resource leading to the country’s development being hindered. On the whole, he said road accidents were preventable but if this did not happen, the number could increase several fold in the future, he said. Road accidents should be dealt with expeditiously otherwise they could cause severe social and economic impact.    While addressing the workshop, State Minister of Transport,  Lasantha Alagiyawanna said  the nearly 25 plans must be put into action to prevent road traffic accidents. It should be effected annually and cannot be implemented at once. “To prevent accidents was a national responsibility and the media should extend its fullest support to reach the desired target. Except for Asian countries, Sri Lanka cannot be compared with other countries with the population and the road network.  We have no safe road network. There are no running tracks, pedestrians have little or no pavements to walk on and the differently-abled cannot use the road network in Sri Lanka. However, he was in praise of the Police, saying that they did their utmost to prevent accidents,” Alagiyawanna said. Meanwhile, he said Police have made arrangements to introduce an e-traffic police app to prevent road accidents getting the support from the public and every arrangement has been put in place to introduce the app soon.   By Naalir Jamaldeen"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/28/doctors-to-withdraw-from-peripheral-hospitals/,Doctors to withdraw from peripheral hospitals,Author not found,0,2023-09-27T20:35:00+00:00," Doctors warned they would take measures to limit the medical resources made available to peripheral hospitals after the next two weeks if the Health Ministry failed to provide them with a feasible solution to the brain-drain amongst the medical fraternity. Secretary of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Haritha Aluthge yesterday (27) said this was to thwart any bogus action by the Health Ministry to intimidate them into staying in the country. He said countrywide public awareness campaigns would be organised from 2 October. Action would also be taken to educate political leaders. “The Cadre approval was made available only in 2015. But no action has been taken to expand the availability of human resources with the expansion of hospital services and units.”  He noted that action would be taken to collect details of peripheral hospitals starting from Central Dispensaries to assess the number of doctors available. “If only one doctor is manning the post measures would be taken to withdraw and place him or her in one of the major hospitals,” he said. “We would have to close the Central Dispensaries and peripheral hospitals.” The outfit’s Central Committee had unanimously decided to support any trade union action against any decision that is politically motivated, outside the law and tradition and decided to defeat any action to solve this, which is out of tradition and without the agreement of the stakeholders, by resorting to political and legal measures. He urged the medical fraternity to come to Colombo on 11 October if the Health Ministry continues to give false solutions to the issue.  He said this situation was being used to set up private medical colleges (PMCs) without even conducting a feasibility study. The PMCs are going to be set up overlooking the deficiencies in State-run medical education. “It takes six years to produce a fully-fledged medical practitioner. Does the Health Ministry expect the public to wait till such doctors are produced?” he queried. Dr. Aluthge added that there was also a solution that had been presented to recruit foreign doctors. “At present, a specialist doctor receives a basic salary of Rs 88,000. Who is the qualified specialist foreign medical practitioner who would like to come to Sri Lanka and work for that amount?” he questioned. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/28/imf-leaves-without-reaching-a-staff-level-agreement/,IMF leaves without reaching a staff-level agreement,Author not found,0,2023-09-27T20:34:00+00:00,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff that concluded their visit to Sri Lanka yesterday (27) left without reaching a staff-level agreement. They stated their commitment to continue working towards it in the near term, with the goal of sustaining the reform momentum necessary for Sri Lanka to recover from its severe economic crisis. The first tranche of USD 330 million was awarded by the IMF in March following the approval of USD 3 billion rescue package, however, yesterday, the officials of the IMF said there is no fix time for the second tranche for Sri Lanka pointing out Sri Lanka yet to meet the obligations of the IMF recommendations. Despite early signs of stabilisation, full economic recovery is not yet assured, the IMF team said. Growth momentum remains subdued, with real GDP in the second quarter contracting by 3.1 per cent on a year-on-year basis and high-frequency economic indicators continuing to provide mixed signals. Reserve accumulation has slowed in recent months, the IMF team led by   Peter Breuer and Katsiaryna Svirydzenka who were in Colombo between 14 to 27 September said in their official statement. The IMF statement continued thus, “The people of Sri Lanka have shown remarkable resilience in the face of enormous challenges. Sri Lanka has made commendable progress in implementing difficult but much-needed reforms. These efforts are bearing fruit as the economy is showing tentative signs of stabilisation. Inflation is down from a peak of 70 per cent in September 2022 to below 2 per cent in September 2023, gross international reserves increased by USD 1.5 billion during March-June this year, and shortages of essentials have eased. “Sustaining the reform momentum is critical to put the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and stable and inclusive economic growth. The authorities have met the programme’s primary balance targets and remain committed to this important pillar of the program so as to support their efforts to restore debt sustainability. However, revenue mobilisation gains – while improved relative to last year – are expected to fall short of initial projections by nearly 15 percent by year end, in part due to economic factors. The onus of fiscal adjustment would fall on public expenditure if there were no efforts to recoup this shortfall. This could weaken the government’s ability to provide essential public services; and undermine the path to debt sustainability. To increase revenues and signal better governance, it is important to strengthen tax administration, remove tax exemptions, and actively eliminate tax evasion. “Against continued uncertainty, it also remains important to rebuild external buffers by strong reserves accumulation. Building on the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s success in controlling inflation, refraining from monetary financing will help keep inflation in check. Other challenges include maintaining cost recovery of electricity pricing. “The Government has made steady progress on structural reforms. Key legislations passed in Parliament, including the new Central Bank Act and the Anti-Corruption Act, could improve governance if implemented effectively. The IMF Governance Diagnostic Report would inform future reform measures to strengthen governance when published. A new welfare benefit payment scheme was enacted with new eligibility criteria that aims to improve targeting, adequacy, and coverage of social safety nets. To ensure financial stability, steps were taken on conducting bank diagnostics, developing a roadmap for addressing banking system capital and liquidity shortfalls, and improving the bank resolution framework. “The authorities have also made headway on regaining debt sustainability through the execution of the domestic debt restructuring and advancing discussions with external creditors. As Sri Lanka is restructuring its public debt which is in arrears, Executive Board approval of the first programme review requires the completion of financing assurances reviews. These financing assurances reviews will focus on whether adequate progress has been made with debt restructuring to give confidence that it will be concluded in a timely manner and in line with the program’s debt targets. “Discussions are on-going, and the authorities are continuing to make progress on their plans for revenue mobilisation targets, anti-corruption efforts, and other important structural reforms.  “The IMF team held meetings with President and Finance Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, State Minister   Shehan Semasinghe, Chief of Staff to the President   Sagala Ratnayaka, Secretary to the Treasury   K M Mahinda Siriwardana, and other senior government and CBSL officials. The IMF team also met Parliamentarians, representatives from the private sector, civil society organisations, and development partners. “We would like to thank the authorities for the excellent collaboration during the mission. The team will continue its discussions in the context of the First Review with the goal of reaching a staff-level agreement in the near term. We reaffirm our commitment to support Sri Lanka at this difficult time.”  (SRM) "

This revelation was made during a recent meeting of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Energy and Transport, chaired by Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda, in Parliament. The committee convened to discuss various matters, including the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (Amendment) Bill, the Annual Report of the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Limited for 2022, and the Performance Report of the Ministry of Shipping and Aviation for the same year. The committee approved the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (Amendment) Bill during this session. The Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation presented progress updates during the committee meeting, confirming that construction progress for the East Container Terminal currently stands at 20 per cent. The full completion of this terminal is anticipated in the second quarter of 2025. Further, ministry officials also reported a 20 per cent advancement in the construction of the Western Terminal at Colombo Port, with its expected completion also scheduled for the second quarter of 2025.

Minister Wijesekera, however, underscored that the existing workforce is sufficiently equipped to manage the operations of these institutions and provide essential services. Specifically, he provided an overview of the staffing situation, stating, “In the Petroleum Corporation, there are 3,292 approved staff positions, with 2,100 individuals presently employed, resulting in 1,192 vacancies. Meanwhile, the Ceylon Electricity Board, which has 24,000 approved staff positions, employs 21,000 individuals. Additionally, 3,000 external hires have been brought in to address specific service requirements, leaving a need for 3,000 more employees to reach the approved staffing levels.” Minister Wijesekera acknowledged that the Government has refrained from exploiting these vacancies for political gains. Instead, it has prioritised unpopular yet necessary decisions to advance the sustainable economic development of the nation. “It’s important to recognise that, while I could potentially offer employment to an additional thousand individuals from the Matara District within the Petroleum Corporation for political advantage, such actions would be inconsistent with the Government’s policy, which places the integrity of these institutions above political interests,” he emphasised. He was speaking during a conference titled ‘Restructuring of Government Institutions for a New Development Approach,’ held at the Ministry of Finance on 26 September."

Recently, a protest was held against constructing of a hotel within the sanctuary by the area residents. Speaking during the Gampaha District Development Committee, the minister said given the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Conservation and the Central Environmental Authority’s decision to preserve the Muthurajawela Reserve through a gazette, there can be no room for development projects.  In line with a circular issued by the Presidential Secretariat, all development projects within the Muthurajawela Reserve must come to an immediate halt, Fernando added that under no circumstances can approval be granted for land reclamation projects in the dedicated area. If any activities are causing harm to the Muthurajawela ESZ, they will undoubtedly face strong opposition from the public, and those responsible will be held accountable for their actions, he asserted. The Muthurajawela marsh is the largest saline coastal peat bog in the country and was granted the status of a wetland sanctuary under the Flora and Fauna Protection Act in 1996 by the government. This unique ecosystem, home to diverse wildlife, has faced threats in the past, notably during the construction of the Colombo – Katunayake Expressway. The marsh serves as a critical retention area for surface stormwater runoff and supports the livelihoods of a substantial local population. Preserving Muthurajawela is not only essential for the well-being of people and wildlife but also for the overall economy of Sri Lanka, a nation already grappling with the severe consequences of the ongoing climate crisis, the minister pointed out.

This plan encompasses various promotional campaigns, the development of cities that never sleep, the establishment of taxi associations, and even the consideration of legalising marijuana, she said and added that Cabinet approval has been granted for the cultivation of marijuana, with the goal of bolstering the country’s foreign reserves. During a media briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (27), Gamage outlined her strategy to achieve this objective. She noted that in the first nine months of the year, Sri Lanka has seen a notable increase in tourist arrivals, with approximately one million foreign visitors already gracing the nation’s shores. The expectation is that this number will further rise to 1.5 million by year-end. Gamage highlighted the anticipation of a substantial influx of European tourists during the final months of the year, coinciding with the onset of winter in Europe. The Ministry is actively targeting European countries, including the UK, despite the economic challenges they may be facing. To enhance the convenience and satisfaction of tourists, plans are in motion to provide essential night-time facilities in popular destinations like Ella, Nuwara Eliya, Galle, and Colombo. These cities are slated for transformation into vibrant 24/7 hubs through regulatory adjustments aimed at facilitating tourist spending. Further, she expressed her support for the legalisation of sex work in Sri Lanka, emphasising its potential positive impact on the country’s economy."

According to a senior official at SLR, this has resulted in a substantial loss of Rs 245.45 billion between 2015 and 2022. Notably, in 2021, the SLR reported an expenditure of Rs 40.41 billion, which increased to Rs 42.53 billion in 2022—an increase of Rs 2.12 billion in just one year. The data reveals a significant disparity between income and expenses within the SLR over the past eight years. Despite annual revenues not surpassing Rs 8 billion from 2015 to 2021, expenditures consistently exceeded Rs 29 billion each year. In 2022, although the department achieved revenue exceeding Rs 10 billion for the year, its expenses soared to over Rs 42 billion. This marked the third consecutive year with the highest expenditure in the past eight years. Further, it was noted that the SLR generates a daily income ranging from Rs 25 to 27 million through its railway stations. Despite this income, the financial imbalance remains a significant challenge for the department’s sustainability, the official pointed out. By Mithun Jayawardhana"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The Judge, announcing the verdict, said he was imposing the death sentence on the five accused, as the prosecution had proved its charges against them, beyond a reasonable doubt. State Counsel Osmin Azwer, prosecuting on behalf of the Attorney General, informed Court, that it had been proved during investigations, that the haul of heroin seized from the possession of the five accused, had not been assembled for personal use, but for the sole purpose of trafficking. He said due to the severe harm, such actions could cause to society at large, the Court should impose the most severe of punishments on the five accused, which is the death sentence. He added that the target group of the accused had been schoolchildren and hence, they should not be let off leniently. The lawyers for the defendants, then urged the Court, to impose lenient penalties on their clients, considering the harsh impact, severe sentences could have on their families and their children. The defendants then maintained from the dock, that they were clueless about the charges that had been preferred against them and that they were innocent of it.

Addressing a meeting with Provincial Governors on 26.09.2023 at Temple Trees, he stressed that a voluntary program is required to prevent drug trafficking. Speaking on this occasion the Prime Minister further stated; “It is necessary to implement the program in order to improve the economic, political and administrative situation in the country. Attention should be paid to the functioning of local government bodies that do not have public representatives currently. There are no public representatives in the local government institutions for more than a year. The President has made arrangements to continue the work of the provincial councils by appointing district development committee chairmen and the work of the Divisional Secretary’s Divisions by appointing development committees in the divisional secretariats. The President had issued a circular instructing that the governors should work together with the district secretaries. As representatives of the President, Governors enjoy special executive powers. Government officials and governors should pay considerable attention to all aspects of development and governance. More attention should be paid on placing multitasking employees. It should get the support of the provincial councils. This cannot be done by government departments alone. In some districts only a small number of placements have to be completed. These people don’t have O/L qualification. N.V.Q special training has been provided by the government. Take steps to place them in a proper institution that have been recognized for training. There are certain issues regarding teaching appointments. Steps should be taken to give appointments in each province. This will make the teaching appointment program successful. Those teachers who were sent to provinces or districts out of their residence might not remain in those schools. There is a surplus in some regions. Our sole aim is to educate the students and not to grant concessionary transfers. Placement of the government teaching appointments should be taken place in order to fill vacancies in the respective provinces. The Ministry of Local Government has recognized that it is possible to increase the income of all local government bodies. This should be given special attention. Court fines, stamp revenue, other transfer and financial provisions are less directed to local authorities. The development committees should pay attention to this and try to reduce the expenses. Former President and the current President had a policy of increasing solar energy. But the progress is very slow. Priority should be given to provincial councils and district committees to implement projects. Digitization of local government agencies leads to increase revenue. The concerned commissioners have been advised in this regard. At the same time continuous supervision is very important. Some illegal methods of revenue should be looked into. Drug usage and drug trafficking has increased. Pay attention in this regard at the provincial level together with the police. If prompt steps are not taken it is uncertain where the killings due to internecine war between underworld gangs might end. This situation must be controlled. During the war, Public Security Committees were formed. The police were in alert. Such a voluntary program is needed again. Instructions should be given to control this situation through these steps. Children, teachers and young people should possess understanding in this regard and carry forward this drug prevention movement. Discussions should be held with security forces, inter-community organizations, and religious leaders to control this situation immediately. Not every child who leaves school can be admitted to university. They should be directed to vocational education. More attention should be paid, especially in directing them to information technology. Unless attention is paid in this regard at district level, these children tend to join various gangs. Direct the young children to a programme targeting their future. There are thousands of acres of government or government-related unutilized estate lands owned by the Land Reforms Commission which are not being used for a productive purpose.The government decided to allow the youth to cultivate these lands for a short period of time.

SLYCAN Trust’s initiative of developing a Multi-Actor Partnership on Climate and Disaster Risk Management and Finance launched into a new phase on 19 September at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo, with the participation of key stakeholders from the agriculture, tourism, fashion, and SME sectors. The key focus of the session was on collaborations, partnerships, and exchanges between different actors and stakeholder groups that could enhance opportunities related to accessing climate and disaster risk finance, strengthen existing mechanisms, harness synergies, and increase mid- and long-term economic resilience. Opening the event, SLYCAN Executive Director, Attorney-at-Law Vositha Wijenayake highlighted the importance of focusing on climate and disaster risk management for building long-term resilience. “Climate change is a key factor that impacts today’s development. It is important that climate risks and impacts are considered and addressed in planning local and national level economic empowerment as well as resilience-building guided by inclusive and participatory processes,” she said. Importance of climate and disaster risk management and multi-actor partnerships Speaking at the event, SLYCAN Trust Director of Research & Knowledge Management Dennis Mombauer explained the work conducted in the first phase of the programme. “We have established this multi-actor partnership with a focus on Sri Lanka’s food systems to identify opportunities for enhancing and building on existing risk management and transfer mechanisms and accessing climate and risk finance.” “Moving into this new phase, we aim to formalise the partnership and expand it to additional sectors – tourism and trade, fashion and apparel – that are climate-vulnerable but also have the potential to empower entrepreneurs, communities, and youth, as well as‌ contribute to building overall resilience and prosperity,” he explained. As an output of the discussion on short- and medium-term goal setting for climate and disaster risk management, the stakeholders from the tourism sector identified the need for better risk mapping and risk transfer processes for the sector, including possible risk pooling through collective funding processes being set up. Additionally, it was further highlighted that it would be important to focus on the climate risks that are threatening the industry, while also identifying solutions through awareness and enhancing information sharing amongst key stakeholders in the industry. Climate resilience and innovation across diverse sectors The stakeholders representing the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) sector highlighted the need to focus on the sector as a priority in the conversations on climate adaptability and capacity building. The need for innovating the business models used by the SME sector to match global trends on sustainable innovation was identified as a tool to build resilience, while entrepreneurship skills development to adapt to climate change was recognised as a cross-cutting theme for all the sectors from national to local level. Under the discussions on the food systems-related sector, the participants highlighted that research and development was a key aspect in scaling up climate change adaptation action. Among other points highlighted were Public-Private Partnerships; partnerships for knowledge and evidence sharing and scaling-up research related to the sector; and innovative technologies and technology transfer; as well as the importance of urgent measures for addressing climate-induced loss and damage in food systems. The participants also emphasised the need for climate risk management in aquaculture. Diverse stakeholder participation In addition to the tourism and SME sector representatives, the event also saw the participation of representatives from the finance, banking, and insurance sectors, who contributed to the discussion by providing solutions and approaches to be generated in climate and disaster risk finance options for Sri Lanka.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/28/life-and-times-of-prophet-muhammad-pbuh/,Life And Times of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH),Author not found,0,2023-09-27T20:32:00+00:00,"  “And We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) not but as a mercy for the Aalameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists)” [al-Anbiya’ 21:107]. Thus, Allah epitomises the excellent qualities of mercy our beloved Prophet Muhammad possesses {May Allah’s Peace and Blessings be Upon Him (PBUH)}. Furthermore, the Holy Quran disclaims any superhuman characteristics for Muhammad but describes him as a man having the highest moral excellence (Quran 68:4: “And thou dost, surely, possess sublime moral excellences”). On this day when Muslims all over the world are remembering the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), in this peace, I wish to recall some of the events in the Prophet’s-Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam (SAW)-(May Allah honour him and grant him peace), life where he demonstrated these qualities of ‘sublime moral excellences’ in real life. Incidentally, Islamic historians are unsure about the actual date of Prophet Muhammad’s birth. Still, it is recorded in Musnad–al–Muslim that when the Prophet (PBUH) was asked for his reason for fasting on Mondays each week, he replied that it was the day of his (the Prophet’s) birth as such he was fasting in remembrance of this day. Returning to the subject of the Prophet’s possession of ‘sublime moral and excellence’ and that of being a merciful human being. The Prophet first demonstrated these qualities during his visit to Taif after being persecuted in Mecca. “When Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) called the people to Islam in Makkah, he was opposed by the leaders of the tribes of Quraysh. The Prophet (PBUH) was ridiculed and those who converted to Islam were persecuted and tortured. The people of Quraysh boycotted the Muslims for three years, and the Muslims suffered from sickness, hunger, and poverty. In the same year, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) lost his two strongest supporters and sources of comfort: his wife, Khadijah, and his uncle, Abu Talib. Without the protection of his uncle, Abu Talib, in Makkah, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) needed to reach out and seek support beyond the city of Makkah. He (PBUH) wanted to spread the message to the people of Taif, hoping they would believe and accept the message of Islam. He trekked from Makkah to Taif to invite the people to the belief in ‘One God’. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) met with the Chiefs of the major Tribe in Taif, ‘Thaqeef’. He (PBUH) told them about Islam, worshipping only ‘One God’ and leaving Idol worshipping. They rejected his message and insulted him. Not only did they refuse to listen to his message, but they unleashed the children of their tribe to throw stones at him and drive him out of their town. With people jeering at him as his ankles bled, he ran out, finding shelter in an empty orchard. Alone, bleeding, and rejected, he (PBUH) rests on a rock and prays to Allah. He (PBUH) is so compassionate and merciful; he does not ask Allah to punish the people of Taif or to execute revenge against them; instead, the ever-merciful Prophet ( PBUH) supplicated to Allah as follows”. “To You, my Lord, I complain of my weakness, lack of support, and the humiliation I am made to receive. “Most Compassionate and Merciful, You are the Lord of the weak and my Lord. To whom do You leave me? “To a distant person who receives me with hostility? Or to an enemy You have given power over me? As long as you are not displeased with me, I do not care what I face. “I would, however, be much happier with Your mercy. I seek refuge in the light of Your face by which all darkness is dispelled, and both this life and the life to come are put in their right course against incurring Your wrath or being the subject of Your anger. “To You, I submit until I earn Your pleasure. Everything is powerless without your support.”  At that moment, Angel Jibreel came to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and told him that if he wished, Allah could order an angel to collapse the two mountains surrounding the people of Taif and crush them. How did Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) react to those who had insulted him and threw stones at him? He (PBUH) opted for mercy not violence towards them. He was not overcome with rage or hate. Instead of seeking revenge against the people of Taif, he said to Angel Jibreel, “I rather hope that Allah will raise from among their descendants, people who will worship Allah the One, and will not ascribe partners to Him.” Later, under the same circumstances prevailing in Mecca of persecution of Muslims by the nonbelievers, the Prophet sought refuge in Medina, which was called Yathrib at the time. It is essential to highlight that Muhammad (PBUH) did not enter Medina as a conqueror. He went there seeking refuge from persecution in Mecca. But strangely, the people of Yathrib welcomed the Prophet (PBUH) and accepted him as their leader. Therefore, he (PBUH) sought the confidence of the Yathribite populace by declaring the “Saheefa”, a charter guaranteeing peace and protection to all the people. The Constitution of Medina, also known as the Charter of Medina (Sahifat al-Medina), is believed to have been written in 622-624 CE and is said to have been drawn up on behalf of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) shortly after the Prophet arrived in Yathrib as it was known then, in 622 CE which is the first Hijra Year {(1 AH)-named for the migration of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) from Mecca to Medina more than 1,400 years ago}. Allah has continued to remind us of the Prophet’s (PBUH) qualities in several verses in the Holy Quran as follows: “Indeed, a messenger has come to you from among yourselves. Your difficulties are grievous to him, he is full of concern for you, and he is very kind and companionate with the believers” (Tawba verse 128). “Indeed, there is a good example for you in [the character of] the Messenger; [and] for those who have hope for God, and the Last Day, and remember God much” (Al Ahzab verse 21). Thus the life led by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was a perfect example for all Muslims to follow. He possessed every excellent quality one could ever think of. He was kind, polite, well-mannered, sympathetic, humble, good-tempered, good-natured, and so forth. Anyone who wants to emulate an individual’s character must emulate the character of the Prophet, according to the Holy Quran. This fact is extensively acknowledged by great scholars as follows: George Bernard Shaw –”He must be called the saviour of humanity. I believe that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it – much-needed peace and happiness” (The Genuine Islam, Singapore, Vol. 1, No.8, 1936) “But the very idea that Muhammad would have found anything to be optimistic about in the carnage committed in his name on ‘September 11th’ is an obscenity, because, as I try to show in these pages, Muhammad spent most of his life trying to stop that kind of indiscriminate slaughter. The very word Islam, which denotes the existential “surrender” of the whole being to God, which Muslims are required to make, is related to ‘Salam’- ‘Peace’”. And most importantly, Muhammad eventually abjured violence and pursued a daring, inspired policy on non-violence that was the culmination of his prophetic career. In imagining that the holy war was the culmination of his career, the fundamentalists (extremists) have distorted the whole meaning of his life. Far from being the father of Jihad (Exertion or Struggle), Muhammad (PBUH) was a peacemaker who risked his life and nearly lost his closest companions because he was so determined to effect a reconciliation with Mecca. Instead of fighting an intransigent war to the death, Muhammad (PBUH) was prepared to negotiate and compromise. And this apparent humiliation and capitulation proved, in the words of the Holy Qur’an, to be a great victory (Fat-‘h)….If we could view Muhammad as we do any other important historical figure we would surely consider him to be one of the greatest geniuses the world has known”. (A Biography of the Prophet). It is impossible for anyone who studies the life and character of the great Prophet (PBUH) of Arabia, …., to feel anything but reverence for that mighty Prophet (PBUH), one of the great messengers of the Supreme. And although in what I put to you I shall say many things which may be familiar to many, yet I myself feel whenever I re-read them, a new way of admiration, a new sense of reverence for that mighty Arabian teacher. Thus, it can be seen, far from being dictatorial, that the Prophet of Islam – Muhammad (PBUH) adopted a semi-democratic form of administration to unite the peoples of different faiths as one community. An excellent example for nations in conflict to promote peaceful coexistence not only within their own territories but worldwide. May the peace and blessings of God be showered upon Prophet Muhammad. Ameen! By Dr. M. Haris Deen"

Because of the variations in vocabulary, grammar, and syntax of each sign language, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to translation. Jehovah’s Witnesses have proven up to the challenge. Not only do they hold the distinction of publishing the world’s first complete Bible in American, Brazilian, Mexican, and Russian Sign Language, but they also offer Bible-based content in over 100 different sign languages on their official website, jw.org. “We don’t want anyone to be overlooked,” said spokesperson Naleen Wanigasekara. “So jw.org offers sign-language videos that share practical advice from the Bible on how to cope with discouragement, how to have a happy family life, how to use your time wisely and so much more.” The Witnesses’ efforts to reach the deaf with their positive message does not stop with the translation of their website. They also try to meet and speak with deaf people in their community. Luxmikaanth Nimalamoorthy, who is deaf, was contacted by Jehovah’s Witnesses at his home. “I was impressed by the great lengths that hearing ones went through to learn sign language and help the deaf community. The talks that were translated into sign language at their meetings touched my heart.” Deaf persons are warmly invited to view the content available in their preferred sign language on jw.org, the official website of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Times and locations of local meetings held in sign language can also be found on the website. Admission is free and no registration is required."

Dr. Jalagge, a visionary leader and dedicated advocate, migrated to Perth, Western Australia, in the late 1990s. It was during this time that he identified a pressing need in the Perth community for comprehensive support services tailored to individuals grappling with mental illnesses and psychosocial disabilities. He observed that many of these individuals, already marginalised by their conditions, were further burdened by poverty and the lack of affordable community support. Motivated by a deep sense of compassion and a commitment to make a meaningful difference, Rosh embarked on a journey to provide holistic and affordable care solutions. He collaborated with psychiatric hospitals and other healthcare providers, establishing a foundation for comprehensive mental health care in Western Australia. As his commitment to community service grew, Dr. Jalagge extended his focus to another vulnerable demographic – the elderly. Inspired by Sri Lankan values that emphasise caring for one’s parents and the elderly with love and compassion within one’s own home, he aimed to instil these values within the Western Australian community. Thus, his aged care services were born, which have since expanded across Australia, offering compassionate, community-oriented care for the elderly. Rosh’s efforts not only transformed the landscape of mental health and aged care in Australia but also created numerous employment opportunities for Australians and immigrants alike. His approach, rooted in compassion and collectivism, has not only improved the quality of life for those in need but has also strengthened the fabric of Australian society. Dr Jalagge, along with his wife Priyanka Gamage, also founded the philanthropical foundation ‘Rosh and Priyanka Foundation’. Through this, Rosh has been a consistent and significant donor to people in need in Sri Lanka throughout the years; mainly focusing on education, medical and disaster relief. Rosh is also a renowned donor to the Sri Lankan society in Australia donating hundreds of thousands of dollars each year, and providing employment opportunities and assistance to new migrants to Australia. His philanthropic activities are further extended to the indigenous society in Western Australia as well. Remarkably, Dr. Jalagge’s recognition with an Honorary Doctorate from Edith Cowan University makes him one of only two Asians to receive this esteemed honour. The first recipient was the King of Thailand, underscoring the exceptional nature of his contributions to society. Edith Cowan University celebrated the extraordinary achievements of Dr. Rosh Jalagge and his unwavering commitment to the welfare of vulnerable populations in Australia. This Honorary Doctorate reflects the deep appreciation and admiration for his service-based entrepreneurship and philanthropic endeavours and serves as an inspiration to all."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

According to the President’s Media Division (PMD), the President said the new law will transform the Port City into ‘Colombo Financial Zone’, granting it jurisdiction over offshore activities. The President emphasised that the success of dispute resolution mechanisms was not just essential for the country’s economic growth, but also vital for Sri Lanka’s aspirations to become an outward-looking economy. He highlighted forthcoming legislation aimed at transforming the Port City into the Colombo Financial Zone and the transition from the Board of Investment (BOI) to the Economic Commission, both of which are designed to facilitate more efficient dispute resolution. The President, while speaking at the 2023 Commercial Mediation Symposium, held at the Hilton Hotel in Colombo,underscored the imperative need for a cultural shift towards more efficient dispute resolution mechanisms in Sri Lanka. In his speech, the President acknowledged the country’s long-standing reliance on trial courts and emphasised the importance of embracing alternative dispute resolution methods. Highlighting the government’s commitment to this cause, President Wickremesinghe made reference to the establishment of the Alternate Dispute Resolution Centre in 2018 and expressed his unwavering support for its continued growth. He urged the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Investments to collaborate closely in advancing these initiatives. During his address, President Wickremesinghe emphasised the significance of change, stating, “Alternate dispute resolution, arbitration, both have a long way to travel in Sri Lanka and that’s our problem. We have to first find ways of how we can adjust to this process. You need a change of culture. Change of culture where disputes can be resolved in the shortest possible time.” He acknowledged the prevailing tendency to adhere to traditional Trial Court procedures, emphasising the need for change in this regard. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of international trade agreements and urged Sri Lanka to establish itself as a prominent centre for alternate dispute resolution. He called upon legal professionals to broaden their horizons beyond national borders and specialise in emerging fields such as AI, Blockchain, and green energy, underlining the importance of securing the nation’s competitive future in a rapidly evolving global landscape. President Wickremesinghe emphasised that Sri Lanka must position itself as the central player in the region. When examining Singapore as a benchmark, Sri Lanka should strive to match or surpass Singapore in various aspects, except for cost, where it should maintain a competitive advantage. This approach is crucial because there exists a noticeable void in this region, which Sri Lanka can effectively fill if it acts swiftly. “This is the key lesson to be derived. Furthermore, it is essential for all lawyers and individuals involved in legal services to broaden their perspectives and explore opportunities beyond their current scope,” the President added."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer.

India has expressed its concerns over a long time, but we have come out with the SOP (standard operating procedure). When we were making that, we consulted many of our friends, including India.

It has been out of order since 22 August 2023. President of the Government Radiological Technologists’ Association (GRTA), Chanaka Dharmawickrema yesterday (26) said according to the service provider, the breakdown was due to a fault in the air conditioning system of the unit where the machine is installed. Failure to control temperature and humidity has been cited as the cause of machine breakdown. Dharmawickrema said the two linear accelerator machines in the National Hospital Kandy have been out of action since November last year, owing to the faulty in cooling system of the building where the machines are kept. He said at least 40 to 50 patients were being treated daily by these machines at the Teaching Hospital, Batticaloa.

Speaking at a media briefing held at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), Aluthgamage pointed out the urgent need for the establishment of a dedicated unit tasked with overseeing institutions responsible for tax revenue generation, including the Inland Revenue Department. The government has set ambitious revenue targets, including Rs 3,101 billion from the Inland Revenue Department, Rs 1,217 billion from Sri Lanka Customs and Rs 217 billion from the Excise Department. Unfortunately, current figures fall short of these expectations, with the Inland Revenue Department collecting Rs 956 billion, Sri Lanka Customs contributing Rs 578 billion, and the Excise Department generating Rs 109 billion, totalling only Rs 1,643 billion. The government is now facing the task of bridging this revenue shortfall, he said. He also stressed that the government’s imperative role in taking decisive actions against officials who are not actively contributing to the growth of the State’s tax revenue. Aluthgamage asserted, “A pivotal meeting took place with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and representatives from the International Monetary Fund. These discussions yielded remarkable results. Today, they are scheduled to update the nation on the progress made in line with the government’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).” The IMF has pinpointed three critical areas of focus during these discussions. As a result, the government has pledged to reduce inflation to a single digit, fortify foreign reserves and augment government tax revenue. “Of particular note, food inflation, previously at an alarming 95%, has significantly dropped to -5%. Overall inflation has decreased from 70% to a mere 2.6%, while foreign reserves have seen substantial growth, increasing from USD 20 million to USD 4 billion. However, the primary emphasis of the IMF remains centered on boosting government revenue, primarily due to the fact that 90% of government income is derived from taxes,” he elaborated.

The event, where school equipment and uniforms were distributed to 12,000 schoolchildren, was made possible through the support of the Chinese Government. The President emphasised that King Rajasingha, has been overshadowed by history due to a reference in Chulavansa made two centuries after his reign. President Wickremesinghe urged a reconsideration of the historical approach that has favoured victorious figures while neglecting those who faced defeat. Symbolising the distribution of school equipment and uniforms, the President presented school equipment to several students during the event. It is worth mentioning that this assistance is a direct outcome of the Prime Minister’s visit to China. Hanwella, Avissawella, situated in the Western Province, boasts an advanced education system. The Prime Minister is making a substantial commitment towards its further development. Highlighting the significance of preserving historical and cultural heritage, President Wickremesinghe revealed that he has instructed the Department of Archaeology to explore the archaeological treasures of the Sitawaka Kingdom. This effort aims to shed light on the historical significance of the region and pave the way for the construction of a museum dedicated to Sitawaka’s history. President Wickremesinghe emphasised the need for the country’s children to receive both modern education and knowledge about Sri Lanka’s rich cultural history. He expressed his commitment to ensuring that Sri Lankan youth are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to shape the nation’s future. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe called for a re-evaluation of the character and history of King Sitawaka Rajasingha, suggesting that the narrative surrounding those who lost battles in history should be reconsidered. In an effort to encourage knowledge-sharing, President Wickremesinghe invited local school students to submit facts about the Kingdom of Sitawaka and King Sitawaka Rajasingha. He pledged to reward the school that submits the most compelling information. Despite recent economic challenges, President Wickremesinghe assured that the Government remains committed to allocating more resources for free education and healthcare. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the current education system and his determination to transform Sri Lanka into a vocational training centre while providing children with an education system that empowers them for the future. During the event, a poem was recited in honour of King Rajasingha, highlighting his historic significance. King Rajasingha’s actions are recognised for preventing Sri Lanka from facing a fate similar to Mozambique or Angola and for being the only South Asian king to successfully defeat the Portuguese. President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed the importance of preserving the historical legacy of Kingdom of Sitawaka, emphasising its role in safeguarding Sri Lanka’s independence. To ensure this heritage is passed down to future generations, he announced plans to establish a museum in the Sitawaka area. Furthermore, the President instructed Chief of Defence Staff Shavendra Silva to oversee the construction of memorials at key historical battle sites, such as Mulleriyawa and Danthurei. These efforts aim to commemorate the bravery and sacrifices of those who contributed to Sri Lanka’s history. President Wickremesinghe emphasised the need to revisit the legacy of King Sitawaka Rajasingha, a courageous and patriotic leader who has been overlooked by history. He pointed out that historical accounts, like Chulavansa, have often favoured winners over losers, neglecting those who lost battles. As a result, he called for a re-evaluation of King Sitawaka Rajasingha’s character and contributions. In addition, President Wickremesinghe instructed the Department of Archaeology to commence work on preserving the archaeological significance of the Sitawaka region, which is expected to undergo rapid urbanisation in the coming years. This proactive approach aims to safeguard the historical heritage of Sitawaka from potential loss, similar to what occurred in the city of Kotte. President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of understanding the past while building the future. To encourage this, he invited students from Sitawaka schools to submit essays detailing the history of Kingdom of Sitawaka. A prize will be awarded to the school with the most outstanding submission, promoting a deeper appreciation of Sri Lanka’s historical heritage among the youth. The event was attended by Justice Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles, Members of Parliament Jagath Kumara and Yadamini Gunawardena, Western Province Governor Marshal of the Air Force Roshan Gunathilake, Jagath Surasena, Principal Rajasingha Central College as well as teachers, parents, students and other dignitaries."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/27/sp-upgrades-local-currency-sovereign-credit-rating/,S&P upgrades local currency sovereign credit rating,Author not found,0,2023-09-26T20:31:00+00:00,"S&P Global Ratings raised Sri Lanka’s ratings from ‘SD/SD’ (selective default) to ‘CCC+/C’, reflecting a forward-looking opinion on the country’s creditworthiness in local currency obligations. This upgrade comes after the completion of the government’s domestic debt exchange program with superannuation funds, which S&P Global Ratings viewed as a distressed restructuring. In addition to the overall upgrade, the issue rating on Sri Lanka’s local currency bond maturing in October 2023 has been raised to ‘CCC+’ from ‘D’. However, the long-term foreign currency rating remains at ‘SD’, and no outlooks are assigned to ‘SD’ ratings as they represent a condition and not a forward-looking default probability opinion. The stable outlook on the long-term local currency rating reflects improvements in the government’s debt profile through domestic restructuring, despite ongoing economic, external, and fiscal pressures. S&P Global Ratings stated that the ratings could be lowered if further indications of restructuring of obligations denominated in Sri Lankan rupees (LKR) to commercial creditors arise, such as rapid inflation, increased government interest burdens, or worsening fiscal performance leading to funding pressures in local currency. Conversely, an improvement in the sustainability of the government’s local currency debt stock could lead to a further upgrade. This might occur if the government’s fiscal metrics and the overall performance of the Sri Lankan economy improve more rapidly than expected. S&P Global Ratings also mentioned that the post-restructuring ratings tend to be in the ‘CCC’ or low ‘B’ categories, depending on the new debt structure and the sovereign’s capacity to support it. The successful completion of the domestic debt exchange programme and a separate restructuring exercise on debt owed to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is viewed as supportive of Sri Lanka’s near-term creditworthiness on its local currency obligations. These actions will reduce refinancing needs and the government’s interest bill. However, Sri Lanka’s ability to meet its financial commitments in the long term remains dependent on favourable economic developments. As of May 2023, local currency-denominated Treasury Bills and Bonds outstanding were approximately LKR 14.1 trillion, equivalent to about 60% of GDP. Despite ongoing restructuring efforts, Sri Lanka’s net general government indebtedness is expected to remain at more than 100% of GDP through at least 2026, with the government’s interest burden remaining above 50% in 2026.

This is being done in order to assist consumers in Colombo, who are forced to purchase vegetables and fruits from far-flung regions of the island, resulting in their having to pay significantly higher prices. Notably, prices of upcountry and low-country vegetables are exorbitant in Colombo and other Western Province Districts. In response to this issue, Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera has directed officials to initiate a project aimed at cultivating vegetables required by Colombo, within the district itself. Consequently, Miriyagalle has been chosen for this endeavour, with an initial group of thirty farmers from the village gearing up for vegetable cultivation across 250 acres. The Ministry of Agriculture is providing comprehensive support and facilities to the farmers in Miriyagalle, including financial subsidies of Rs 500,000 per farmer for poly tunnel cultivation. The inflated prices of vegetables can be largely attributed to losses during transportation from economic centres like Dambulla and Tambuttegama to Colombo, increased transportation costs, and the influence of intermediaries. These intermediaries buy produce from farmers and sell them to Colombo consumers at marked-up prices. A recent discussion at the Ministry of Agriculture resulted in the Minister’s instruction to develop Miriyagalle as a dedicated vegetable-growing hub for Colombo. The Minister emphasised the need for this initiative saying, “In Anuradhapura and Moneragala, pumpkins that cannot be sold for even Rs 10 go up to Rs 80 in Colombo. This price will never decrease. It had been reported in the media that 10 kg of kekiri had to be sold to pay the fee to use the toilets once at the Dambulla Economic Centre. Yet, in Colombo, a kg of kekiri costs about Rs 50.” The minister further said, growing the vegetables Colombo needs within the district itself will help curb the influence of middlemen and prevent consumers from being exploited. The vegetables cultivated in Miriyagalle will be directly supplied to Colombo, bypassing intermediaries. The minister assured that all necessary support and facilities would be provided to the farmers involved in this project. BY Hansi Nanayakkara"

Nimal Bandara, Chairman of the Joint Farmers’ Organisation of Minipe, expressed satisfaction with the prices received by rice and maize farmers in Minipe this year. He said, Minipe farmers received favourable prices, with wheat fetching between 110 and 120 rupees per kg and maize prices ranging from Rs 140 to 170 per kg. He further remarked that these prices brought happiness when compared to the previous season’s rates. The farmers’ organisation’s attention is now directed towards cultivating an additional season next year. Bandara conveyed these sentiments during the District Agriculture Committee meeting held at the Kandy District Secretariat Auditorium on Monday (25). Expanding on their agricultural efforts, Bandara mentioned that approximately 250 acres of rice and 150 acres of maize were cultivated. He emphasised that providing a fertiliser subsidy for maize cultivation could facilitate its growth and potentially contribute to controlling the prices of chicken feed. Kandy District Secretary Chandana Tennakoon, presented the facts and informed the committee that he had already made requests to the relevant authorities, including the Ministry of Agriculture, regarding the provision of fertiliser subsidies for maize cultivation. He expressed optimism that there would be a positive response to these requests.

Rangebandara suggested that Premadasa is skilled at entertaining people with fictitious stories that make them laugh. Rangebandara further said Premadasa’s reliance on such tactics stems from his  inability to politically survive without them, which is why he resorts to making baseless allegations in public and taking up issues related to social media. Premadasa, according to Rangebandara, is attempting to turn the issue into a new controversy and is even threatening to resort to extreme measures if social media is suppressed. Speaking at Sirikotha, Rangebandara said, while the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, it also imposes limits to protect the rights and privileges of everyone in the country. Rangebandara said, significant progress has been made in various aspects of the country under the administration of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. He said, solutions have been found for many pressing issues and the country is on a path to recovery. He also said, President Wickremesinghe’s recent participation in the G-77 Summit in Cuba was testament to his global leadership recognition. He said, that President Wickremesinghe had held constructive discussions with Samantha Power, South Korean Prime Minister and the King of Malaysia with regard to the current crisis situation the necessity of assistance from them to rescue the country from the bankruptcy it has been plunged into today. President Wickremesinghe has been invited to take part in the Youth Conference to be held in Germany and is expected to deliver an oration under the title ‘Climate Changes and Restructuring Debts’.  Very soon Cuba’s President is expected to visit Sri Lanka on an invitation extended by President Wickremesinghe.

The Judge, in her verdict deemed that the prosecution had proved its charges, against the accused former SDIG, beyond a reasonable doubt and thus imposed the said sentence on him and instructed him to pay a fine of Rs 25,000 as well.  The sentence was imposed by Judge Jayaratne, over the case filed against the convict for influencing the Kahawatte Police OIC Lalith Rajamanthri, not to apprehend State Minister Premalal Jayasekera, in connection with a shooting incident targeting a group of people, who were assembling a platform for a political event in Ratnapura, in the lead-up to the Presidential Election, eight years ago. The Attorney General had indicted the accused former SDIG, before the said High Court and for having flouted Provisions contained in Section 209 of the Penal Code. Deputy Solicitor General Janaka Bandara, prosecuting on behalf of the Attorney General, addressing the Court, before the passing of the sentence, stated that influencing a subordinate of whatever rank in a State institution, is a punishable offence under the law and that such actions, cannot be condoned under any circumstance. Hence, he requested the Court, to mete out suitable punishment to the accused former SDIG, in order to deter others, from the public service, committing such offences in the future. On 5 January 2015, the Pelmadulla Chief Magistrate issued an arrest warrant on the lawmaker and several local politicians, over their alleged involvement in the shooting incident, at a venue of an election rally of former President Maithripala Sirisena, who was the Common Opposition Candidate at the time.  A political supporter, who was engaged in decorating an election stage, was wounded in the shooting and succumbed to injuries in hospital on 8 January of that year. MP Premalal Jayasekara, former Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council Member Nilantha Jayakody and former Kahawatta Pradeshiya Sabha chairman Vajira Darshana were arrested in January 2015, over the incident, whereas MP Jayasekara was later enlarged on bail in December that year. In July, 2020, Jayasekara and the other two accused were sentenced to death, over the fatal shooting incident. The verdict in the case had been delivered by the Ratnapura High Court. However, later in March last year, the Court of Appeal acquitted MP Premalal Jayasekara and two others, of charges pertaining to the relevant shooting incident, since, there was no evidence of the three accused being in possession of firearms, at the time of the incident and them firing shots.

However now, after the rupee has strengthened, the Ministry was purchasing it at Rs 2,000 per vial.

Waving black flags and holding placards, the demonstrators marched through Dandugama to voice their fervent opposition. A. Tharanga, a local activist, actively engaged in the protest, expressed his concerns to the media, stating, “The reclamation of the Muthurajawela Wetland Sanctuary would have a detrimental impact not only on Ja-Ela but also on the entire Gampaha District. Muthurajawela is a world heritage site, with a fragile ecosystem, that houses a diverse range of bird species and a unique community of flora and fauna exclusive to Sri Lanka. Moreover, the sanctuary plays a crucial role in the local tidal process. If Muthurajawela is reclaimed for hotel construction, our future generations will undoubtedly condemn us for permitting such an environmental travesty.” Joining the protest, Kanchana Perera expressed her concerns, saying, “The reclamation of Muthurajawela spells doom for our villages and would lead to our having to face floods. Today, they are attempting to reclaim Muthurajawela by distributing bags of goods to some villagers and offering money to a few who are willing to compromise their principles.” Namal Suranga, the chief organiser of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in the Ja – Ela electorate, emphasised the significance of Muthurajawela’s ecosystem, saying, “Even former President Maithripala Sirisena recognised its importance by issuing a special gazette to prohibit its reclamation. Its value is apparent, but it has been threatened for personal gain. Today, the people have awakened to oppose these landfills.” When queried, Ajith Panditaratne, the Chairman of Malwatta Company, which is planning to construct a hotel complex on a portion of Muthurajawela said, “We are proceeding with this project after securing all the necessary permissions from relevant government authorities. This hotel project, spanning 52 acres, has received permission from the Attorney General’s office and the Court. We are following the prescribed guidelines and cannot execute it as we see fit. Furthermore, 20 acres will be allocated for the construction of tanks and reservoirs, benefiting the local community.” BY Prasanga Pawuluhewa – Ja Ela"

Marasinghe stated that the President has effectively dispelled any misconceptions held by the rest of the world, especially the developed Western nations, about Sri Lanka. He added that this positive situation has arisen due to the international community’s recognition of the foreign policies and goodwill that President Wickremesinghe has fostered, especially with donor countries such as Japan, the USA, India, China, Germany, and countries under the European Union’s jurisdiction. He noted that President Wickremesinghe’s vision has been embraced by both capitalist and socialist nations simultaneously, leading to tangible benefits for Sri Lanka. Marasinghe cited the President’s recent keynote address at a summit in Cuba, hosted by China, as a prime example of this. During a media briefing at Sirikotha, Marasinghe emphasised that President Wickremesinghe advocates for a foreign policy that doesn’t favour any specific political ideology or entity. In addition to addressing criticisms, President Wickremesinghe seized the opportunity during his recent tour to engage in discussions with leaders and high-ranking officials, particularly from Malaysia, South Korea, Germany and the USA, while in Cuba. As a result of these discussions, the South Korean leader promised President Wickremesinghe that they would consider providing more employment opportunities to Sri Lankans and prioritise Sri Lanka in their foreign employment programmes. Marasinghe further claimed that President Wickremesinghe’s statements to the American media, where he asserted that he is not beholden to any specific country like the USA, China, or India, clearly demonstrate his commitment to not being subservient to any global superpower, regardless of their economic and political stature.

The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

In a statement, FUTA said this protest will bring together academics from 17 universities and approximately 46 academic trade unions, alongside leaders from 26 non-academic and executive unions within the university system who are pledging their support. The protest will address several key issues. Firstly, the academic and university community is very dissatisfied with the Government’s neglect of state universities, particularly in terms of funding and human resources. Universities have been grappling with a severe crisis since they are unable to recruit permanent staff. Despite a significant increase in student enrolment from 30,000 to 45,000, the number of academic staff has remained stagnant and is rapidly declining due to retirements and emigration. Currently, the academic staff requirement for all seven universities stands at more than 15,000, but the existing number is less than 6,500. This shortage has led to overburdened academics and an inadequate student-teacher ratio. Secondly, the Government’s university restructuring policies pose a serious threat to the existence of a free education system. These policies signal a shift towards self-financing institutions, raising concerns about the future of accessible higher education. FUTA and the joint front of non-academic unions are determined to protect state universities and uphold the principles of free higher education. Lastly, the protest also calls for the reversal of unfair taxation policies and advocates for a fair tax system to address tax evasion. Additionally, FUTA opposes the Government’s proposal to cut superannuation funds and impose heavy interest on them, which could significantly impact workers’ retirement savings. “FUTA is inviting the public to join their struggle to protect the country’s free higher education system, as they believe that the government’s current policies threaten to deprive future generations of this valuable resource. The protest is expected to draw widespread attention, with FUTA calling on media organizations and social media activists to provide extensive coverage of this crucial event,” the statement added."

The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Rohana Hettiarachchi, Executive Director of PAFFREL, expressed grave concerns over this decision, particularly in light of the ongoing economic crisis, deeming it unwise and not in the country’s best interest. Hettiarachchi also pointed out that the Election Commission of Sri Lanka had already allocated substantial funds for the 2023 LG Polls, which encompassed expenses such as the printing of ballot papers. The Ministerial Consultative Committee on Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government unanimously consented to cancel the nominations submitted for the Local Government Election 2023. This decision was taken considering the significant difficulties faced by those who had submitted nominations, due to the postponement of the elections. The Local Government Election 2023, which was originally scheduled to be held on 9 March, had to be postponed indefinitely due to lack of funds. The unanimous consent was reached at the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government meeting held on 20 September in Parliament.

The 58-year-old sergeant has been serving at the Administration Division of Galle Police for a significant period. In April last year, a sum of Rs. 727,150 was credited to the Galle Police account from the Police rewards fund, designated as reward money for the officers of the Galle Police. Subsequently, the accountant issued a check for the specified sum and handed it over to the accused sergeant, acting on the recommendation of the IP of Galle Headquarters Police, who then cashed the cheque at a State bank. However, concerns arose when vouchers confirming the payment of the reward money to the Police officers were not received. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the suspect had cashed the cheque but failed to distribute the money to the deserving Police officers. The accountant promptly reported this discovery to the higher officials. Subsequent investigations revealed that the sergeant had engaged in fraudulent activities by withholding the reward money from the Police officers. BY Farhan Nizamdeen – Galle and S.

During a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday (24), President of the Association Upul Rohana revealed that PHIs are planning to conduct comprehensive inspections of all school canteens in the near future. “We are committed to closely monitoring school canteens,” he stated. Rohana emphasised that while the school canteen policy may not be a fully enforceable legal document, it has been observed that issues arise due to the provision of inappropriate food to schoolchildren through these canteens. “We have issued a circular with guidelines outlining which foods are safe for schoolchildren and which foods are permissible for sale in school canteens,” he explained. “Both school authorities and those responsible for maintaining the canteens have been duly informed of these guidelines,” he added. Furthermore, Rohana pointed out that although there may be certain legal challenges in pursuing action against those who violate these guidelines under the Food Act, it is entirely feasible to take legal measures in cases that jeopardise the health of schoolchildren. “We are committed to implementing stringent oversight of school canteens in the future,” he affirmed."

A photograph depicting Foreign Minister Ali Sabry alongside his son during an event at the UNGA recently gained significant attention on social media. The image prompted questions about the reasons for Sabry’s son being part of the official delegation, leading to allegations of nepotism against the Foreign Minister. In response to these concerns, Minister Sabry provided a clarification, “In light of the concerns expressed on social media regarding my son’s presence at a few bilateral meetings held during the UNGA, I wish to provide the following context: “In addition to my responsibilities in supporting the President with his high-level engagements, my role as the Foreign Minister involves maintaining a demanding schedule during my visits to the UNGA and Washington D.C. This itinerary encompasses delivering ten speeches and interventions, participating in three public events, and engaging in numerous bilateral and multilateral meetings. The extensive workload requires extensive research, speechwriting, and meticulous preparations. “To aid Ministers in fulfilling their respective duties, each of us benefits from a Minister’s bureau, consisting of both paid and voluntary contributors. My son has served as a research assistant and speechwriter on an ad hoc, voluntary basis at my request for a period of time. During the UNGA sessions, he volunteered to offer his time and expertise for a few days, as he is currently pursuing his studies in the United States. “I would like to acknowledge that his contributions significantly assisted me in preparing for these critical engagements. Importantly, neither the Foreign Ministry nor the Government of Sri Lanka has incurred any expenses on his behalf, whether related to his involvement in these engagements or at any other time. His contribution has been entirely voluntary and incurred no cost to the taxpayer. “I firmly believe in the public’s right to demand accountability from their representatives, and I remain committed to providing the facts to enable informed judgment,” Ali Sabry said."

The WFP recently carried out food distribution, providing 50 kg of rice, 20 kg of lentils, and 5 litres of cooking oil to low-income families, disabled individuals and those in need on a bi-monthly basis.

Advanced Level Examination 2023 next week. In a statement, Premajayantha said, a significant number of students and MPs representing both the ruling party and the Opposition, have called for a postponement of the A/L examination, citing various concerns. The minister acknowledged that when considering this request, it is essential to weigh the consequences of postponing the A/L Examination 2023 to next year. He mentioned that the ongoing postponement of school Examinations and result releases has been due to a variety of challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic, trade union actions, and economic crises. “These issues have adversely affected schoolchildren and parents alike. Additionally, delays in university admissions, higher education course enrollments, and foreign university applications over the past few years have hindered students from pursuing further education at the appropriate age,” he pointed out. However, the Education Ministry is doing its best to prevent the exam from being continually delayed, he pledged. He also pointed out that if the A/L Examination 2023 is rescheduled to January 2024, the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examination 2023, originally planned for March and April 2024, would have to be postponed to May or June, leading to repeated delays.” “Such disruptions would affect the school term calendar and, consequently, the admission of students to Grade 1, potentially hindering their chances to apply for foreign universities and scholarships. Moreover, State job recruitments would face delays due to postponed examination result releases,” he added. Speaking further, the minister said the decision to revise the A/L Examination 2023 dates was made in consideration of the considerable number of students who applied for the exam after the release of the A/L 2022 results, noting that there were 18,473 more applications compared to previous years following the release of results’.

The Hospital Specialists expressed concern alleging that outsourced private sector janitorial staff were unofficially utilised in cleaning even the interiors of the hospital’s theatres and the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of the largest teaching hospital in Sri Lanka. The janitorial workers are tasked with cleaning the sanitation facilities of patients and the public, the environment, the sewage and drainage systems. They have not undergone a screening for their health condition and thereby they could be carriers of infections.  They noted that cleaning up of theatres and ICUs, where a high level of sterility was expected, were supposed to be carried out by the NHSL’s health assistants (minor employees). The Committee appointed had submitted its report to the Health Secretary, Janaka Sri Chandragupta last week. However, it appears that there is an effort to sweep the whole issue under the carpet and continue as before. They noted that strong recommendations had been made while it had been pointed out that there was no need to even appoint a committee in this regard. It was the Deputy Director General of the NHSL Colombo who should be responsible for implementing the infection control manual guidelines. President of the College of Medical Laboratory Science Sri Lanka (CMLSSL) Ravi Kumudesh claimed that there had been incidences of infections triggered amongst laboratory staff by samples of live unsterilized bacterial cultures being taken for disposal with the hospital’s general waste, whereas it should be placed in an autoclave and sterilised prior to disposal. Under the circumstances janitorial staff had been compelled to handle such waste despite being without appropriate protection.       However, several attempts to contact the Committee’s Chiarman, Dr. Somathunga for comment failed as she was allegedly at a meeting and later was unavailable for comment. Senior Microbiologist Dr. Patabandige refusing to comment said, “I was not the Chairman of this Committee,” she said noting that the Committee’s report had been handed over to the Health Secretary, while any question in this regard should be put to him.  Several attempts to contact the Health Secretary also failed.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The discussion will highlight the UAE’s significant role as an international player capable of concurrently engaging with multiple partners, including those in the Indo-Pacific Region, the Port City Developers, the CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC), announced yesterday (21). The Developers said, in this context of having the close-door forum, the UAE aims to strengthen its connections with the Indo-Pacific Region and Sri Lanka will play a crucial role in this partnership, with its trade and investment offerings, mainly through the upcoming multi-billion-dollar Port City Colombo development Project. Designated as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), it provides attractive incentives for international businesses, making it an ideal destination in the Indian Ocean. What sets it apart is the independent governance framework led by the Colombo Port City Economic Commission, that aligns with global standards and ensures a business-friendly environment, further solidifying Sri Lanka’s status as a significant player in the regional economic landscape. Port City stands as a meticulously planned man-made island city, designed to attract international businesses. The promotional efforts have been executed according to plan, and this sprawling development spans 269 hectares of land reclaimed from the sea. It is set to encompass five distinct precincts, namely the Financial District, Central Park Living, Island Living, The Marina, and the International Island. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Its Chair Patali Champika Ranawaka said the consumers will be able to decipher whether the sticker is genuine or not via the QR code once this particular sticker was introduced. He stated that furthermore the introduction of such a sticker will also enable the Excise Department to identify the exact amount of tax it could obtain and the exact amount of tax that could be levied from each product etc. He made these observations whilst addressing the said Committee in the House yesterday. Among others who participated in the sessions were MPs Dr. Harsha de Silva, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, and Ashok Abeysinghe, along with officers from the Excise Department, IRD and the Finance Ministry. Responding to questions posed by the Committee, the officers from the Excise Department stated that raids were continuing to apprehend those behind the counterfeit sticker racket. They mentioned that following those raids, it had come to light, that 90 per cent of the stickers placed on bottles of liquor were fake. They remarked that they had also brought the matter to the notice of the CID too, but were of the view that the CID were yet to identify those behind the racket and the precise location from where the racket had been set in motion. The committee also insisted on finding out whether retail outlets, involved in the liquor trade, were engaged in this counterfeit racket. They instructed the Excise Department to continue with their raids and warned that licences of firms involved in the racket would be cancelled henceforth. The Committee also urged the Excise Department to impose fines on those found guilty of being involved in the racket. The Excise Department was also instructed to submit a report to the Committee stipulating the precise amount in fines they had imposed on firms engaged in this racket since 7 September this year. The detailed report should be submitted to the committee on the precise loss incurred by the Excise Department, due the racket. During the sessions it was revealed that there were around seven liquor manufacturing firms, which had to date refrained from paying the requisite taxes to the Excise Department and that two firms  in particular namely Globe Blender and the Wayamba Spirits Stores had abstained from paying taxes to the tune of Rs 1.5 billion. It was then decided to inform all of the liquor manufacturing firms that were in arrears to pay their taxes on or before 15 October and cancel the licences of such firms if they still continue to act unheeding these instructions by 30 October."

This momentous agreement, signed yesterday (21), in Colombo, was attended by dignitaries, including Minister of Transport and Highways Bandula Gunawardena, and High Commissioner of India in Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay. The signing ceremony also saw the presence of the Governor of the Eastern Province Senthil Thondaman, State Minister of Highways Siripala Gamalath and senior officials from the Ministry of Transport and Highways, Sri Lanka Railways and IRCON Ltd. This vital project, which is being executed under an Indian Line of Credit (LOC) of USD 318 million, comes at a total cost of USD 14.90 million. High Commissioner Gopal Baglay highlighted the strategic importance of the Signalling Project, emphasising its role in improving the mobility of the people of Sri Lanka, fostering economic recovery, and further strengthening the cooperation between the two nations. He noted that the LOC extended for this project underscores India’s steadfast commitment to supporting Sri Lanka during challenging times. In response, Minister Gunawardena expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and the Government of India for their unwavering support to Sri Lanka, particularly during the economic crisis last year. He acknowledged that India has been a vital partner in Sri Lanka’s railway projects, offering significant support in the form of LOCs. The signing of this agreement adds to a series of successful railway projects in Sri Lanka executed under Indian LOCs, totaling over one billion USD. IRCON Ltd, with its operations commencing in Sri Lanka in March 2009, has played a crucial role in the rehabilitation and modernisation of Sri Lanka Railways, as well as capacity building and employment generation. Currently, IRCON Ltd. is engaged in another essential project involving the upgrade of the Railway Line, including track rehabilitation and ancillary works from Maho to Omanthai, covering a distance of 128 kilometres, at a cost of USD 91.27 million.  The track rehabilitation work from Anuradhapura to Omanthai has already been completed with work on the section from Anuradhapura to Maho scheduled to commence in January 2024."

During the Adjournment Debate on the controversial Channel 4 documentary, Ranatunga alleged that the Opposition has been engaged in an exercise to spread a canard that President Ranil Wickremesinghe is out to protect those behind the 2019 Easter Sunday terror blasts. He stated that the Opposition should not use nationalism and religious extremism to obtain cheap political mileage.  Speaking further he said “I have spoken about this (Easter Sunday attacks) more than a few times in this House. In May of 2019 we in fact debated this topic for three successive days. In March of 2021, again we did the same. In April of that year too, we debated it for three days. Why do we debate it again today? This whole issue emerged again thanks to the controversial video screened on Channel 4 related to the Easter Sunday blasts. I do not believe that the video in question aired by this TV Station focused on the Easter Sunday carnage. They only focused on one-fifth of its content.” They devoted most of the duration to touch on the civil war here and the Tamil Diaspora was clearly behind it. They screened it just in time ahead of the annual UN Sessions in New York. These people thus used the Easter Sunday blasts to sling mud at Sri Lanka as they have an unfinished score to settle with us, he alleged."

There are plans to remove the food stalls within the Port City by 2027. But during those 4 years what laws do they adhere to? The well composed article says that “the Port City will be a smart city with renewable energy and effective sewerage systems to be incorporated.” But what happens until then? What is happening now? concerns about public health standards have arisen following reports of food poisoning among a group of foreigners, including diplomats, at a Port City restaurant. While Public Health Inspectors routinely monitor hotels, restaurants, and small eateries across Colombo, there remains uncertainty about whether they extend their oversight to the Port City. Questions regarding sewage and waste management also linger, particularly regarding the collection and treatment of garbage and wastewater within the Port City. The Solution surely cannot wait until 2027? What about Law & Order? In March of this year, a tragic incident unfolded within the Port City, where a 24-year-old man lost his life during an altercation. Surprisingly, the official response mentioned the “Harbour Police” investigating the matter. This begs the question: What role does the Harbour Police play in handling such criminal cases within a distinct part of Colombo? We are aware of the Port City having its own Flag, Its own ID’s. Will they also have their own Police Force? As for utilities, there is no direct connection to the main power grid, leaving many to wonder about the supply during the project’s full-scale operation. If generators are in use, it raises questions about the source of fuel and whether it impacts Sri Lanka’s currency reserves. Eventually people will need this to enter the Colombo Port City As the Colombo Port City project progresses, it is crucial to address these pressing concerns. Ultimately, clarity is needed on the legal framework, security, public health, and utilities within the Port City to ensure the well-being of both Sri Lankan citizens and visitors. As the project unfolds, we have to ensure greater scrutiny and accountability in these areas to maintain safety, transparency, and sustainable development. By Game Changer"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/22/nagapattinam-port-gearing-up-tn-minister-velu/,Nagapattinam Port gearing up– TN Minister Velu,Author not found,0,2023-09-21T20:31:00+00:00," The Tamil Nadu Government is actively preparing to upgrade the Nagapattinam to Kankesanthurai (KKS) ferry route, located in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Speculations have arisen that the ferry service could commence as early as October 2023, even though the interior work for the ferry terminal is still in the process of being tendered and calling for bidders. Tamil Nadu Minister for Public Works, Highways and Minor Ports, A. Velu visited the Port of Nagapattinam for an inspection of trade sector activities on 20 September. Plans are in motion to swiftly introduce a High-Speed Passenger Ferry service from the small Port of Nagapattinam, situated approximately 60 nautical miles from Kankesanthurai in Sri Lanka. This mission is coordinated by the Tamil Nadu Maritime Board, a department, within the Tamil Nadu Government, responsible for maritime and port affairs, the Tamil Nadu Minister has said. The Nagapattinam Port, originally a small fishing harbour, has already undergone dredging operations to clear the mouth of the harbour for ferry operations. However, there are additional processes that need to be completed, according to reliable sources. The operation of the ferry, under the ownership of a Singaporean resident of Sri Lankan origin, has already made an investment in a Singaporean ferry ship. It is currently awaiting clearance from Indian authorities. Initially, plans were in place to launch the ferry service between Karaikkal Port in Puducherry and KKS. However, the port, which was running at a loss, was taken over by the Adani Group after the agreement was signed between India and Sri Lanka. The now Adani-run Karaikkal Port had declined to support passenger services at the port as it is a bulk cargo operation and they cannot upgrade for passenger service with safety measures. Consequently, the ferry service was redirected to the Nagapattinam fishing harbour, which had not previously been used for passenger services. According to inside sources, the Tamil Nadu authorities are currently in the process of inviting tenders and selecting bids, which may take longer than initially anticipated and as a result, it is now expected that the ferry service may commence after the Thai Pongal festival in 2024, as the tender process has not yet been initiated. The Indian Shipping Corporation, as part of the Indian Government’s initiatives, is overseeing the launch of the high-speed passenger ferry service from Nagapattinam. Given that this service involves international travel to Sri Lanka, the Indian Government has entrusted the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) with ensuring security. In Nagapattinam’s trade sector, all necessary facilities have been prepared for the commencement of the passenger ferry service, expected to begin in October. The Tamil Nadu Government has collaborated with the Sri Lankan Government to initiate this historic passenger ferry service. This initiative, which is of great significance to both the people of Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu, is expected to substantially contribute to the development of the Tanjavur District, strengthening its ties with Sri Lanka through the Delta regions, boosting tourism, and fostering economic prosperity, the Tamil Nadu Government said. The Customs Department, External Affairs Department, Immigration Department, Directorate General of Shipping, and Shipping Corporation of India, all under the Indian Government’s administration, have played pivotal roles in facilitating this remarkable development, the Minister had said. This initiative holds particular importance for the Tamil community residing in North Sri Lanka, as it facilitates travel to the trade hub of Kankesanthurai.   By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

When contacted yesterday (20), he said in 2022 alone the Cardiology Unit of Teaching Hospital Badulla had treated 2,500 patients suffering from heart disease. Of them, only some had undergone an angiogram. Both the Uva and Sabaragamuwa provinces are short of angiogram machines resulting in some of the patients going undiagnosed. It is only after their death it is found that those patients had been admitted due to a heart ailment.“If we know that the patient is suffering from heart disease then we could treat them accordingly, but in some instances the patient either dies on admission or within 24 hours after admission or is admitted to the hospital and remains undiagnosed.” The 1.5 million population in Uva Province have to travel to National Hospital, Colombo or Kandy or District General Hospital Kalutara Nagoda, Teaching Hospitals Karapitiya and Anuradhapura and District General Hospital, Polonnaruwa to get an angiogram (a scan that shows blood flow through arteries or veins, or through the heart, using X-rays, computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography) done.

On this internationally observed Day of Peace, comes a book to remind us that the peace inside us is always available.  We all know modern life can be so busy it can make us feel frazzled and overwhelmed. Sometimes we look for a way to dim the noise and find some calm moments of peace. In this book full of modern anecdotes and ancient wisdom, renowned global teacher and author Prem Rawat reveals that we all carry within us a hidden resource for doing just that – finding peace – but we have not been taught how to use it. He describes how to turn down the noise and ‘hear ourselves’ – listening to the subtle but strong song of peace that sings inside each of us. Once we learn to listen to the authentic voice within, we can maintain that peace as we face the busy world.  Rawat describes himself as a realist, and writes that the book is not a message to “just think positive”. Prem Rawat will be one of the distinguished guests speaking at the third Annual Global Peace Education Network Conference webinar taking place online on Wed. Sept 20, at 8 a.m. PST.

In response to a query posed by SJB MP Hector Appuhamy, Minister Alles also pledged to investigate the unauthorised release of video clips featuring Zahran, the ringleader of the suicide bombers. He acknowledged that the source of these leaks was unclear but assured the House that he would delve into the matter and provide an update. Further, Minister Alles clarified that the PCoI report did not hold SDIG Nilantha Jayawardena responsible for the attacks. Instead, he mentioned that SDIG Jayawardena had been found liable by the Supreme Court and had been ordered to pay compensation.  At this juncture, a dispute arose when Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella insisted that SDIG Jayawardena had indeed been held accountable for the destruction caused by the Easter Sunday bomb attacks.  MP Appuhamy supported this claim by referring page 320 of the Presidential Commission’s report. In response, Minister Alles assured the assembly that he would provide additional information regarding the Easter Sunday bomb attacks within two days. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

During the committee meeting, Abeywardena claimed the country failed when the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) declared bankruptcy. He claimed the CBSL’s step was wrong because the power of State finance lies with Parliament. Therefore, a large number of CBSL officials are responsible for the plight of the country, he added. Following the controversy that erupted on social media due to his statement, Abeywardena emphasised that such unfounded and fabricated statements on social media constituted an insult to the Finance Secretary and government officials. Speaking to the media at Sirikotha, MP Abeywardena clarified that his 2022 parliamentary statements had consistently focused on the country’s prevailing circumstances, particularly highlighting potential threats to Articles 27, 28, and 29 of the Constitution. He underscored that these parliamentary speeches did not pertain to Finance Ministry officials or other individuals. Abeywardena strongly condemned the irresponsible statements made on Facebook with the sole intention of gaining political mileage. He stressed the importance of rectifying historical errors and preventing their recurrence as the nation moves forward.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He pointed out that the procession commemorating Thileepan in Trincomalee was deemed unnecessary and cited the suspension of a new Buddhist temple’s construction was due to lack of clearance from the predominantly Hindu community and it was rejected by the Grama Niladhari of that area. Governor Thondaman, underlining his resolve to take resolute measures in safeguarding peace said, on the issue involving the construction of a Buddhist temple at Periyakulam on Nilaveli Road in Trincomalee, as requested by Ven. Viharadhikari Sukhitha Wansatissa Thera was rejected based on the fact that 99.9 per cent of the population adheres to Hinduism, and they had expressed opposition to the construction of a Buddhist temple. He emphasised the importance of adhering to the country’s legal procedures for any construction project, stating that while anyone can offer land to someone, there are procedures that must be followed. He noted that Tamils were involved in the protests and as a Governor, his obligation was to promptly address their concerns, especially when they were protesting against the Government. He highlighted that any construction project requires approval from authorities such as the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and Pradeshiya Sabha. “When the Thera visited the UDA and the PS, they were inquired about the presence of public objections and as there were it was rejected. If they can seek a resolution with that community then it’s fine. It is within their purview to either abandon the idea or persuade the community to proceed with the construction. I want to clarify that the decision is not mine to make; my stance is to ensure adherence to legal processes in any endeavour.” Yesterday (20), the Buddhist clergy involved in the construction of the temple were seen gathering signatures from the public to petition against the Governor, who was opposing the temple’s construction. “In a democratic country, individuals are entitled to express their views and take action as they see fit. I wholeheartedly encourage any democratic engagement. I have extensive experience running the largest trade union, the Ceylon Workers’ Congress of Sri Lanka, which boasts over 200,000 members and operates as both a political and trade union party. We engage in daily protests on various issues in different estates, and I will consistently support any democratic actions taken.” According to the Governor, in the incident where the Thera and his associates forcefully entered the GS office during a DCC meeting recently regarding the temple construction, the Governor had told him that their actions were setting a bad precedent for other communities in the country. He explained that he had pointed out to them that if similar actions were taken by different religious leaders, it could lead to chaos.For instance, he mentioned that in Kattankudy, Muslim moulavis might barge into meetings, in Batticaloa Tamil priests might do the same, and in Mannar, Christian priests could follow suit. He said the Governor had refused to engage in further discussions during the DCC meeting. Instead, he directed them to the GS room, where the GS issued a letter permitting access to the land but prohibiting the construction of the Buddhist temple. The residents of the area have consistently requested a plot of land to build a Hindu temple, and their plea has not received approval. Consequently, they questioned how permission could be granted for the construction of a Buddhist temple, as emphasised by the Governor. Further, Governor Thondaman stressed his commitment to preventing any Tamil war hero remembrance processions that could disturb the Sinhala community in the Trincomalee District. He pointed out that the routing of Thileepan’s commemorative procession through a Sinhala village had provoked anger among the Sinhalese. He made it clear that such practices would not be tolerated in the future, and he has issued strict directives to this effect. He also noted that such activities have the potential to undermine national reconciliation and unity.The Governor highlighted that, first and foremost, organisers of events like these should seek permission from the Police, which they failed to do. Secondly, they must recognise that existing tensions between communities can be exacerbated by such actions.Thileepan had advocated for a separate homeland, which the Sinhala community did not support, and conducting his commemorative procession through a Sinhala village can incite resentment and even violence.Governor Thondaman characterised the actions of MP Gajendrakumar as irresponsible.“Maintaining peace and order in the Eastern Province, ensuring that unnecessary disturbances and unethical matters do not occur is vital.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/21/use-of-turmeric-for-indigestion/,Use of Turmeric for indigestion,Author not found,0,2023-09-20T20:32:00+00:00," Turmeric is a well-known culinary spice and is listed as a component of curry powder. It is derived from the root of a rhizomatous, herbaceous, perennial plant, Curcuma longa. As many as 133 species of Curcuma has been identified worldwide. India is the largest producer of Turmeric and is also its biggest consumer. It is used extensively in South Asian and South East Asian cooking. It has also been used in traditional medicine for centuries. It is rich in phytonutrients and anti-oxidants. More than one hundred components have been isolated from turmeric. The main components are a volatile oil, containing turmerone, and colouring agents called curcuminoids. The components responsible for the aroma of turmeric are turmerone, arturmerone and zingiberene. Marco Polo refers to turmeric as ‘Indian saffron’ used for dyeing cloth.     Although it has long been used as a medicinal remedy in South East Asia, in recent years, it has also become a widely available supplement (as either a capsule or powder formulation). Currently, the actual health effects of Turmeric supplementation, on a variety of medical conditions remain uncertain. Some of the conditions in which it is purported to be of benefit include: arthritis, cancer, heart disease and gastrointestinal disease. However, in many of these conditions, good and robust clinical research data are still lacking, for allowing one to effectively evaluate any of the purported health benefits. Curcumin The naturally active compound in Turmeric is called curcumin. It gives turmeric its bright yellow colour and is thought to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-mitotic and anti-microbial properties. Curcumin is poorly water soluble and has low bioavailability. When curcumin is taken orally, only a small amount is absorbed. To overcome this issue, it has been formulated as miscellar, liposomal or microgel formulations, so as to increase its solubility and bioavailability, when used as a supplement. Some agents are known to block the metabolic pathways of curcumin and thus increase its bioavailability. For instance, piperine, a major active component of black pepper, is known to markedly increase the bioavailability of curcumin. Curcumin has been shown to target multiple cell signalling pathways and molecules within a cell. It is available in several formulations including tablets, capsules, ointments, cosmetics, soaps and drinks. One needs to remember that between 2018 and 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States of America (USA) issued 29 warning letters to USA manufacturers of dietary supplements, for making incorrect claims of anti-disease effects, from using products containing curcumin. Indigestion and Omeprazole Functional dyspepsia (indigestion), causes a range of symptoms including: feeling excessively full after food, feeling full after eating only a little food (early satiety), and pain and/or burning sensation in the stomach and/or the oesophagus (epigastric pain). Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is a well-known drug that is used to treat functional dyspepsia. Omeprazole was approved for medical use around 35 years ago and is on the WHO’s (World Health Organisation) list of essential medicines. The long term use of PPIs has been linked to increased fracture risk, micronutrient deficiencies, and a heightened risk of infections. It has a drug interaction with a medicine called clopidrogrel. Tumeric has been used as an antacid in South East Asia for many decades. However, its effectiveness in treating indigestion, when compared to standard drugs has been uncertain. Recent research study In a recent multicentre randomised research study, 206 patients with recurrent functional dyspepsia of unknown cause were randomly assigned to take curcumin alone (69 patients), omeprazole alone (68 patients) or curcumin plus omeprazole (69 patients) for 28 days. The patients for this study were selected from those seen at hospitals in Thailand, between 2019 and 2021. They were aged between 18 and 70 years. The curcumin group received two large 250 mg capsules of curcumin 4 times a day and one small dummy capsule. The omeprazole group received one small 20 mg Omeprazole capsule daily and two large dummy capsules 4 times a day. The dropout rate during the study was between 23 and 29 percent. At the start of the trial, patients in all three groups had similar clinical characteristics. Follow-up assessments were done at one and two months. The indigestion score showed a significant reduction in symptom severity by one month, in all three groups. The improvements were higher after two months. There was no significant additional benefit in the group taking both agents. No serious side effects were noted during the study. However, there was a degree of deterioration of liver function tests in over-weight individuals receiving curcumin. This study showed that curcumin could be as effective as a proton pump inhibitor for treating symptoms of indigestion. This is an important initial research study finding, particularly in an area where good research evidence is badly needed. However, we need to remember that this was a small study and follow-up clinical data were available only for a short period. Potential issues with excessive intake of Turmeric Excessive amounts or turmeric or curcumin may cause diarrhoea, nausea and headache. It has anticoagulant properties and would slow down blood clotting. Turmeric supplements should be stopped for at least two weeks prior to a surgical procedure. It may also interact with other medicines when taken concurrently. The WHO has determined 0.3mg Turmeric per kilogram body weight, as an acceptable daily intake. Individuals with gall stones or diabetes need to take special care when using turmeric supplements. Pregnant and breast feeding women should not take turmeric supplements. In general, the amounts included in supplements are between 500 and 2000 milligrams. In all instances, it is important that a person checks with their healthcare professional before commencing any supplements. Conclusion Further large scale clinical studies should shed light on the use of turmeric in the management of indigestion (a common medical condition). Currently, several clinical and laboratory studies are ongoing, investigating the effects of turmeric and curcumin, on a range of inflammatory and other medical disorders.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/21/linac-machine-out-of-commission-at-batti-hospital/,Linac machine out of commission at Batti hospital,Author not found,0,2023-09-20T20:31:00+00:00," Government Radiology Technologists lamented that cancer patients in the Eastern Province were left in the lurch, due to the  Linear Accelerator (Linac) machine being constantly out of order, due to poor maintenance issues. President of the Government Radiological Technologists’ Association (GRTA) Chanaka Dharmawickrema yesterday (19) said, multiple breakdowns of the Linear Accelerator, installed at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital (TH), during the past few months was an issue not only for patients but also to hospital staff. He said the latest break down was allegedly due to a technical fault in the air conditioning system. According to the company from which the Linac was purchased, it should be kept in the correct humidity provided by the air conditioning system.  Dharmawickrema said the hospital has been unable to operate the machine for the past one week, raising concerns about the continuity of vital cancer treatment services in the region. “The machine is the only one in the region and plays a key role in providing radiation therapy to cancer patients,” he added. With only ten such machines in the island, the breakdown of Linac at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital highlights the precarious state of cancer treatment infrastructure in the country, the GRTA President pointed out. Dharmawickrema said that  Linac was an essential tool in medical technology used in radiation therapy to treat various forms of cancer. It delivers precisely targeted radiation doses to cancerous tumours, minimising damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The recent breakdown has not only caused disruptions to ongoing cancer treatment, but has also led to a backlog of patients due to the disruption of treatment schedules. “One can only imagine the uncertainty and mental strain faced by patients whose treatment has been postponed owing to the criticalness of their illness,” he observed. He said that it left questions about quality of the healthcare system’s infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Approximately 40 patients receive radiotherapy treatment daily at Batticaloa Teaching Hospital, making the uninterrupted operation of the Linac machine imperative. The situation in the Teaching Hospital underscores the urgent need for investment in healthcare infrastructure and Linac maintenance across the country. With just ten Linac machines serving a population of over 21 million, Sri Lanka is grappling with a severe shortage of these critical devices. It is imperative that the government and healthcare authorities take immediate action to address these issues, he stressed. Fielding questions, he said the Bio Medical Unit of the Health Ministry also had the responsibility to inquire as to why the Linac was constantly breaking down at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital and ensure that the hospital continued to provide uninterrupted care and services to cancer patients.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The President emphasised that these nations are focused on their own priorities, including social, economic, and ecological development, and seek to maintain their sovereignty and independence. He made this statement, participating in the ‘Ocean Nations: The 3rd Annual Indo-Pacific Islands Dialogue’, moderated by Dan Baer, Senior Vice President for Policy Research at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and hosted by the Carnegie Endowment and Sasakawa Foundation. President Wickremesinghe asserted that the Sri Lankan Government does not align itself with either India or China and firmly stands for Sri Lanka’s interests above all else. This commitment to sovereignty extends to other island nations in the region. Island nations in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific have distinct priorities, unrelated to the Quad (comprising the US, India, Japan, and Australia) or China’s objectives, he said, adding that Sri Lanka is open to collaboration with any partners willing to respect its autonomy. Regarding regional frameworks, President Wickremesinghe noted that China’s rise occurred within existing regional frameworks such as APEC and ASEAN, which many nations prefer to maintain. The recent expansion of great power rivalry beyond these frameworks has raised concerns among member nations. He said the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean hold immense strategic value. The South Pacific is a vital hub for the US Navy, and the Indian Ocean played a crucial role in World War II. President Wickremesinghe said, “The South Pacific, which includes Hawaii, is where the US dominance of the Pacific was established in WW II, including the Battle of the Coral Sea and Midway, as well as the shooting down of Admiral Yamamoto’s plane. The importance of the Indian Ocean was best described by Winston Churchill, who said the most dangerous moment of the war was the capture of Ceylon and consequently the loss of the Indian Ocean.” The Indo-Pacific concept has gained recognition, primarily due to mounting challenges from China, the President said, adding that it has prompted a re-evaluation of regional dynamics and cooperation, such as the Jakarta Concord within the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). The G7’s attempt to involve European powers and NATO in the Indo-Pacific was met with opposition, with only France expressing interest. This move was seen as violating IORA’s rules-based order, the President pointed out. The President also noted that the Quad has shifted its focus from security and dialogue to applying coordinated pressure in the region. While surface warfare threats are minimal in the Indian Ocean, addressing the issue of submarine warfare within IORA is necessary. Regarding Security Dialogues, the President pointed out that island nations find security dialogues acceptable but emphasise non-interference in their internal affairs. Many island nations, including Sri Lanka, have not engaged in high-level discussions regarding the Indo-Pacific. Recent developments, such as the US opening an embassy in the Maldives, were also noted. The power balance in the Indian Ocean is evolving, influenced by ASEAN, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the emergence of BRICS+. This changing landscape favors the independence of island nations and calls for strengthened cooperation between IORA, ASEAN, and BRICS+. In response to a question about the Hambantota port, President Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka expressed concerns about the labeling of the Hambantota commercial port as a Chinese military base. The country is developing the Trincomalee harbour in cooperation with India and intends to raise this matter at international forums. He also emphasised the need for IORA to accommodate the Indo-Pacific concept, recognising the interconnectedness of the Indian and Pacific Oceans and enabling cooperation among small island states in both regions. The island nations of the Indian Ocean and South Pacific remain steadfast in their pursuit of independence, non-interference, and the protection of their unique priorities amidst the evolving dynamics of great power rivalry in the Indo-Pacific region, the President added."

Premarathna expressed his belief that the system was not only responsible for the attack on his residence but also for the current state of the nation. He emphasised that rather than focusing solely on identifying the perpetrator of the shooting, it is imperative to recognise that the existing system is at the root of such incidents. He further highlighted that this system is widely acknowledged as flawed, both by the citizens of the country and within the realm of politics. It is this systemic flaw, according to MP Premaratne, that has contributed to the challenging circumstances the nation finds itself in today. Meanwhile, several MPs raised their voice in Parliament against the shooting.  Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said it is a responsibility of the government to ensure the security of MPs.

The shipping company or the P & I Club can’t make payments in Sri Lankan rupees as per the Cabinet approval. However, the Government has accepted the rupee payment noted former MEPA Chairman Dharshani Lahandapura.

Dr. Sanjeeva, filing the petition prayed the Chief Justice to move legal procedures against the Ministry of Health for the unacceptable waste of public property for procurement activities, in the emergency purchasing of pharmaceuticals, at a time when the country was going through a severe economic downturn. The country’s State health service was in a serious crisis while health administrators’ cite this as a main reason for the situation.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/19/srilankan-needs-30-pilots-in-the-coming-months-nuttlal/,SriLankan needs 30 pilots in the coming months – Nuttlal,Author not found,0,2023-09-18T20:36:00+00:00," National carrier SriLankan Airlines is in the process of recruiting approximately 30 foreign pilots to manage airline operations and has currently recruited five foreign pilots, while the Government actively seeks investors to take over the ground handling and catering services of the airline. CEO of SriLankan Airlines, Richard Nuttal, told Ceylon Today, “We received permission to hire foreign pilots a couple of months ago. This is not a new practice; we had foreign pilots before the Covid-19 pandemic. However, our priority is to employ Sri Lankan pilots when available, and currently, we have hired five foreign pilots. Depending on fleet requirements and retaining our current crew, we anticipate the need for around 30 pilots in the upcoming months.” Nuttal, in an interview with Channel NewsAsia (CNA) in July 2023, said that SriLankan Airlines is projecting a USD 50 million profit for the next year (2024), emphasising that tourism has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. He added that the airline is largely shielded from currency fluctuations, as 80 per cent of its revenue comes from international sources and ticket fares are set in dollars. Regarding servicing Sri Lanka’s debt, Nuttal explained to the TV channel that the Sri Lankan Government is exploring ways to handle State-owned enterprises. There is an initiative, partly through the IMF, to stop government’s liability for inefficient State-owned enterprises, possibly through privatisation. Nuttal also mentioned that 10% of the airline’s revenue in 2023 was spent on interest payments for past debts, which had nothing to do with SriLankan Airlines. These debts were incurred in dollars, with interest rates ranging from 12% to 15%, which may not be sustainable in the long term if passenger yields decline. As for investor interest, Nuttal explained that in Sri Lanka, all potential partnerships go through a process managed by the State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) unit under the finance ministry. While the government is currently overseeing this process, it is expected that, at some point, they will seek expressions of interest (EoI) from potential partners to work with, although the exact timing remains uncertain. “’We will have wait to see for a good partner to work with and maybe we will get one or maybe not,” he added. Given the absence of investors and the continued growth in international passenger traffic, the government has hired around 96 new air hostesses and is actively pursuing the recruitment of an additional 30 pilots to handle the increasing international passenger demand. Currently, SriLankan Airlines operates 19 out of its 24 aircraft, but faces a significant shortage of ground handling and cargo handling staff. President of the Jathika Nidhahas Sevaka Sangamaya, Janaka Wijeyapathirana, told Ceylon Today that it is a critical understaffing issue at SriLankan Airlines, with a deficit of approximately 400 staff members. He also noted that the government has approved the recruitment of 30 pilots. Additionally, Wijeyapathirana mentioned that locally trained cadet pilots will be hired as First Officers to serve SriLankan Airlines. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Addressing a media briefing at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), Gamlath said, “When I assumed the role of State Minister, numerous highway projects across the country had grounded to a halt, with substantial outstanding payments to contractors amounting to approximately Rs 180 billion. This sum was equivalent to less than one year’s road project budget. We have already disbursed Rs 151 billion, leaving Rs 29 billion to be settled, which has encouraged some contractors to recommence their projects. Additionally, we have successfully cleared a significant backlog of unpaid arrears that had accumulated over several years.” The State Minister said plans are afoot to recommence construction on Sri Lanka’s dormant road infrastructure projects. Funding for these projects is set to be allocated in the forthcoming budget, assuring swift progress and timely delivery to the public. He highlighted that the focus of road development is centered on projects managed by the Road Development Authority, encompassing 12,225 km of roads, 312 km of highways, 5,432 bridges, 12 flyovers, boats, and 9 bridge ferries annually. A robust road network is considered crucial for a thriving manufacturing economy and for enhancing the overall quality of life. Therefore, strategic road widening initiatives are being prioritsed without relying on foreign funding. Substantial annual investments are also directed towards maintaining small bridges and highways. He emphasised the importance of highways for the country, noting that the construction of the Central Expressway had been impacted by currency exchange issues. Nevertheless, he highlighted recent achievements, including the completion of the Mirigama-Kurunegala road and the ongoing progress on the initial 13 kilometres of the Potuhera-Galagedara road, which spans 31 km. He also mentioned the critical port access route project, funded by the Asian Development Bank, which aims to ease traffic congestion in key areas like Colombo Fort and the Harbour. Plans are in place to transfer the port entrance flyover into public ownership by 2024. As the national road system construction continues, significant milestones have already been achieved, with 85% completion of the Kohuwala flyover and 35% progress on the Peradeniya flyover, supported by a Hungarian loan. Out of the targeted 13,160 roads for construction, 5,201 have already been completed. The comprehensive project envisions the construction of approximately 17,850 kilometres of roads, with an estimated budget of Rs 231 billion. Of this amount, Rs 160 billion has already been disbursed for completed projects, leaving Rs 70 billion pending. The upcoming budget will include allocations for maintaining existing roads and restarting stalled projects, promising a positive outlook for on-time completion, he said."

President of the Association of Government Radiologic Technologists (AGRT), Chanaka Dharmawikrama yesterday (18) lamented that 13 September 2023 was the last time the PET scanner at the NHSL had been operated. Of the three personnel, who were trained to operate the piece of technology, one had retired earlier this month while the other had gone overseas. He lamented that the only remaining personnel was on the verge of leaving the service in the near future in frustration. He explained that currently the State health service had two PET scanner machines which have been installed at ‘Apeksha’ Hospital, Maharagama and the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL), Colombo. The Scanner uses a radioactive substance to look for disease in the body. A PET scan shows how organs and tissues are working. A PET scan is largely used to detect the growth and spread of a cancer in the human body, he noted. The AGRT President noted that the test would cost over Rs 300,000 in the private sector. Dharmawickrema lamented that patients in the free health service were at a great disadvantage as a result. He urged the Health Ministry to take urgent measures to either recruit Radiology Technologists from amongst the 150-degree holders whom the Health Ministry has kept idling for the past several months, without taking the necessary measures to enrol them in the State healthcare, to fill the shortage. The AGRT President said the Health Ministry could also give a two-year extension of service to Radiology Technologists who had retired or were due to retirefrom service. He noted that it took at least six months to train a new recruit to handle the PET technology. Meanwhile, informed medical sources noted that there was a gross shortage in trained staff to function the PET scanner at NHSL. At the same time there are those personnel who want to cite this as a reason to force the Health Ministry to give them service extensions where as the Director General Health Services (DGHS) had allegedly issued instructions to stop the NHSL PET scanner for a period of one week till such time that the issue was resolved.

He believes President Wickremesinghe has a clear vision and mission to rescue the country from its current economic crisis, similar to President Jayewardene’s efforts in the 1980s, after coming to power in 1977. Jagoda suggested that if a leader with qualities akin to Jayewardene emerges in Sri Lanka, there would be no one better suited for the role than President Wickremesinghe. Addressing the media at Sirikotha, Jagoda highlighted President Wickremesinghe’s proactive efforts to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Cuba in the fields of health and sport and fostering the exchange of technical knowledge between the two nations. He also pointed out that the tourism industry had significantly deteriorated due to the stringent measures implemented by the former President and the Easter Sunday bombings.

Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday (18), Jagoda also emphasised that Sri Lanka currently requires a leader with political acumen and the ability to establish and maintain diplomatic relations with the international community, akin to the late President J. R. Jayewardene. Furthermore, Jagoda stated that President Ranil Wickremesinghe can be considered a leader possessing skills comparable to President Jayewardene. He believes President Wickremesinghe has a clear vision and mission to rescue the country from its current economic crisis, similar to President Jayewardene’s efforts in the 1980s, after coming to power in 1977. Jagoda suggested that if a leader with qualities akin to Jayewardene emerges in Sri Lanka, there would be no one better suited for the role than President Wickremesinghe. Addressing the media at Sirikotha, Jagoda highlighted President Wickremesinghe’s proactive efforts to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Cuba in the fields of health and sport and fostering the exchange of technical knowledge between the two nations. He also pointed out that the tourism industry had significantly deteriorated due to the stringent measures implemented by the former President and the Easter Sunday bombings. Jagoda criticised the appointment of a Prime Minister for a mere 52 days, which, he believed, exacerbated the situation further. He added, “At that time, politicians like Dullas Alahapperuma, who supported that decision, are now shedding crocodile tears, claiming that the country cannot be effectively governed. Thanks to the prudent actions taken by President Wickremesinghe in a timely manner, every sector is gradually returning to normalcy.” BY Naalir Jamaldeen"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

This initiative which was conducted on the sidelines of the International Coastal Cleanup Day and the National Marine Resources Conservation Week was also participated by Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera. In a concerted effort to combat coastal pollution and preserve the natural beauty of shores, the Sri Lanka Navy orchestrated a series of beach cleaning programmes across all Naval Commands. Expanding their efforts, the Sri Lanka Navy extended similar programmes to encompass all Naval Commands. The Western Naval Command diligently cleaned Crow Island and Galle Face beaches, while the Eastern Naval Command focused on the rejuvenation of Dutch Bay beach. Simultaneously, the North Central Naval Command took on the task of cleaning Urumale beach, and the Northwestern Naval Command turned its attention to the Hunesh Nagar to Karadakkuliya beach patch. These commendable endeavours saw the active involvement of not only top brass including the Commander of the Navy and Area Commanders, but also a dedicated group of naval personnel. Together, they worked tirelessly to rid the shores of copious amounts of plastic, polytene, and various other solid waste materials, safeguarding the allure of these coastal areas. In concert with the National Marine Resources Conservation Week, the Sri Lanka Navy launched an extensive mangrove planting campaign spanning across all Naval Commands. Furthermore, the Navy has scheduled awareness programmes targeting the fishing communities. These initiatives aim to educate and advocate against the irresponsible disposal of plastic and polythene materials into beach environments."

M. Chandrasena made a statement yesterday (17), claiming that the attempt by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to return to politics after fleeing the country and resigning from his position was joke. When asked about the current political situation in the country,  Chandrasena said while Gotabaya Rajapaksa, as the former Defence Ministry Secretary, made significant contributions to liberating the country from the LTTE, they supported him in the Presidential Election 2019, where he secured a landslide victory with an expected total of 6.9 million votes. However, Chandrasena expressed his disappointment, stating that Gotabaya did not possess the qualities required for the role of a President. He alleged that by aligning himself with certain political factions and prioritising their interests, Gotabaya led the country into a state of tragedy, causing widespread discontent and anti-government sentiments among the people. Chandrasena claimed to have received information, from certain sources, indicating that Gotabaya was making an attempt at returning to politics, but he expressed doubts about any positive outcome, suggesting that Rajapaksa’s involvement would likely worsen the situation and be met with resistance from the majority of the people. He also expressed regret that the former President had let down the 6.9 million people who had cast their valuable votes to elect him as President of the country. Further, Chandrasena said the SLPP had no intention of fielding Gotabaya Rajapakse in any future elections, including the upcoming Presidential Election. He asserted that as a national political party, they would move forward by addressing and rectifying mistakes made during the latter’s tenure. BY Naalir Jamaldeen"

The announcement was made at a recent meeting of the Committee on Public Finance (COPF), after the committee argued that these food stalls, categorised as leisure activities, are not in alignment with the primary objective of attracting foreign investments to the Colombo Port City. This discussion unfolded during a meeting held in Parliament on Tuesday (12), presided over by Dr. Harsha de Silva. The Committee, during this session, scrutinised the regulations established under the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act, No. 11 of 2021, which are to be presented in Parliament next Tuesday, 19 September. Inquiries from the Committee extended to the legal basis behind permitting these food stalls and the reasons behind their removal by 2027. The Committee also probed whether the Attorney General’s office had been consulted regarding this matter. The Committee subsequently instructed both the Colombo Port City Economic Commission and the Attorney General’s Department to promptly provide detailed information on this matter for further examination. The Committee went on to inquire about the revenue generated by the ongoing activities within the Port City. Officials were directed to submit comprehensive details on this matter to facilitate a more informed decision before granting approval for the regulations. Moreover, given that the Port City is being developed as a distinct landmass under the Smart City concept, the Committee raised questions regarding the incorporation of smart city elements such as wastewater management, renewable energy solutions and effective sewerage mechanisms. The Committee stressed the importance of avoiding the issues seen in other parts of the country concerning inadequate sewerage and wastewater management when planning and constructing the Port City. Furthermore, it has come to light that various State institutions, including the Road Development Authority, Urban Development Authority, and the Water Board, have invested a substantial amount of taxpayer money in supporting the construction and development of the Port City. Given that these funds are derived from the taxes paid by citizens, the Committee on Public Finance raised pertinent questions regarding the benefits that the citizens of the country could expect to receive in return for these investments. In response to this concern, the COPF has directed the Members of the Port City Commission to furnish a comprehensive breakdown of government expenditures related to the Port City and its associated infrastructure. Additionally, the COPF has requested detailed information regarding the revenue streams generated by the Port City Project."

Prosecution cannot be solely based on confessions obtained from the detained individuals and individuals arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) have the opportunity to seek bail after one year of detention providing them with a legal recourse to challenge their continued detention. The Bill will ensure that it does not compromise the national security of the nation, he added. The Minister said, the Bill will be presented to Parliament for its initial reading. “Within this framework, our citizens will maintain the right to thoroughly examine the Act and voice any concerns they may have. They will also have the opportunity to challenge its provisions and, if necessary, seek legal remedies by approaching the Supreme Court within one week from its publication.” He added that under the provisions of the new Bill, there are several key safeguards and procedural requirements in place to protect the rights of individuals detained under suspicion of terrorism: Individuals can be detained and interrogated for a maximum period of 60 days without requiring prior approval from a Magistrate. However, they can only be held in authorised detention centres. After the arrest of an individual, they must be brought before a Magistrate within 48 hours. Prosecution cannot be solely based on confessions obtained from the detained individuals. Any confession used for prosecution must adhere to the common law requirement, which typically means that it should be made before a Magistrate in accordance with established legal procedures. Individuals arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) have the opportunity to seek bail after one year of detention, providing them with a legal recourse to challenge their continued detention. In cases where individuals are detained for more than one year, such extended detention must be authorised by a Magistrate, adding an additional layer of judicial oversight. “These provisions collectively reflect an effort to strike a balance between addressing security concerns and safeguarding the rights and due process of individuals detained under suspicion of involvement in terrorism. It is important to ensure that these legal safeguards are effectively implemented to protect the rights of those affected by these laws.” Ali Sabry underscored that the existing Prevention of Terrorism Act has undergone substantial amendments with the primary objective of disseminating a balanced legal framework. This framework has been designed to safeguard and uphold the fundamental human rights of our country’s citizens. The Minister, addressing the media at the Presidential Media Centre on Wednesday (13), further noted that in accordance with globally acknowledged standards, comprehensive measures have been undertaken to revise the current PTA, aiming to establish a harmonious legal framework that safeguards both the national security of the country and the fundamental human rights of its citizens. The objective of these revisions is to formulate a law that strikes a judicious balance. “In this context, under the guidance and leadership of the Minister of Justice, extensive deliberations and consultations have been conducted with relevant authorities. These collaborative endeavours have resulted in substantial improvements to the proposed new legislation, elevating it to a commendable standard.” It is important to note that our country possesses a well-established system for enacting and promulgating new laws and statutes. Following the publication of the new Act in the Gazette, it will be made accessible to the entire populace, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of its provisions and implications by the citizens of the nation, he said.

A senior spokesman for the Health Ministry yesterday (15), quoting Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, said that as an alternative solution to the large-scale brain drain taking place amongst doctors, the government has decided to recall retired doctors and specialists for service on contract basis. “The move aims to address the prevailing doctor shortage at hospitals due to brain drain prompted by the economic crisis,” he said. The spokesman said, a Cabinet Paper proposing this alternative solution would be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers. He said, a substantial number of medical practitioners, both MBBS qualified doctors and medical specialists had recently migrated to foreign countries, in search of better remuneration and quality of life. He pointed out that it had resulted in the collapse of health services in a number of State Hospitals. Meanwhile, senior medical specialists warned that they would be at a serious disadvantage in agreeing to continue in service unless the age of retirement was extended from the stipulated 60 years. Most of the specialists who are of a retirement age are stationed at their end posts in Colombo, Galle, Matara, Negombo, Gampaha, Ratnapura and Jaffna where they are closer to home. In addition, their immediate juniors would be prepared to step into the positions on their retirement. They noted that the brain drain was severely affecting the hospitals in the peripheries. But having past those postings none of the specialist doctors would like to reverse their steps and go back to the peripheries after retirement. Therefore, the government and the Health Ministry would have to have a clear idea as to how they were going to resolve the issue by recalling and extending the service of doctors on retirement even if it is on contract basis, a spokesperson for the senior medical specialists added.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/15/the-key-to-sustainable-food-systems/,The Key to Sustainable Food Systems,Author not found,0,2023-09-14T20:32:00+00:00," The fabric of our global food system is fraying under the strain of climate change and an ever-expanding population. To prevent it from unravelling, we must embrace distributed renewable-energy solutions, which are critical for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, boosting resilience and productivity, and cutting costs. Failure to do so would jeopardise efforts to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and threaten our very survival. Halfway to the 2030 deadline, progress towards the SDGs – conceived as a “shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet” – is lagging significantly. In July, the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in New York and the UN Food Systems Summit +2 Stocktaking Moment in Rome underscored the importance of ensuring access to modern energy (SDG 7) and achieving zero hunger (SDG 2), respectively. When it comes to strengthening the long-term resilience and adaptability of the global food system, these two objectives are interlinked. Translating this into public policies has taken on new urgency, given that rapid global warming, population growth, public health crises, volatile energy markets, and conflict have exposed the food system’s unique vulnerabilities and shortcomings. Past solutions and approaches will no longer work; on the contrary, they contributed to the current problems. Previously, concerns about food supply – including high prices during the 2008 global financial crisis – invariably led to agricultural intensification and mechanisation, as well as an increase in land use. As a result, agribusiness (including the production, transport, and storage of food) today accounts for roughly one-third of all GHG emissions, which in turn threaten the future of agriculture. While the effects of climate change are felt throughout the global food system, they are disproportionately borne by those least responsible for the problem: smallholder farmers in the Global South. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa, which relies on rainfed agriculture, already experiences one-third of the world’s droughts and is vulnerable to higher temperatures and other extreme weather. The IMF has found that a single drought can lower an African country’s medium-term economic growth potential by one percentage point. That conclusion reflects agriculture’s central role in the developing world: in some of the least-developed countries, it accounts for more than 25% of GDP, while 52% of employed people in Sub-Saharan Africa are active in the sector. Given this, achieving sustainable and climate-friendly food production in the Global South could lead to significant welfare improvements. This will require a shift to distributed renewable energy, which can be used in primary production, post-harvest processing, storage, and cooking – the agricultural activities that tend to consume the most energy in developing countries. To be sure, decentralised renewable energy is not a panacea. But it could contribute significantly to stabilising the global food system by lowering energy costs, a crucial factor for boosting productivity; by facilitating financing for productive applications, which could democratise access to yield-enhancing technologies; and by reducing GHG emissions and promoting climate-change adaptation. Last but not least, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and decentralising energy production can help shift global power dynamics within the food system. Solar-powered irrigation, for example, has significantly improved water access and enabled multiple cropping cycles, increasing productivity and reducing GHG emissions. Solar-powered pumps have boosted farmers’ incomes by more than 50% in India and led to significant increases in yields in Rwanda. The Ethiopian Ministry of Irrigation and Lowlands – which one of us heads – recently banned the import of diesel irrigation pumps to support the rapid transition to renewable energy solutions. In Sub-Saharan Africa, solar milling machines could make grinding grain into flour more efficient, affordable, and sustainable. Additionally, the expansion of mini-grids to power post-harvest processes can bring more economic and environmental benefits by enabling communities to preserve their produce locally. Cold storage and refrigeration are crucial for extending shelflife, reducing food loss, and maintaining product quality. Decentralised cold-storage solutions that are powered by renewable energy could improve market access and reduce spoilage for smallholder farmers and remote communities. By converting existing infrastructure to renewable energy sources, we can cut GHG emissions and make cold chains more environmentally friendly and affordable. All the above examples demonstrate the diverse applications of distributed renewable energy, and each solution contributes to a more resilient, sustainable, and climate-friendly food system. By scaling up these innovations, we can address the energy challenges faced by smallholder farmers, processors, and consumers while reducing our carbon footprint. Reinforcing the fabric of our global food system requires a new framework designed to reduce land use, enhance productivity, minimise food loss, and cut GHG emissions. Renewable energy must be its foundation. Otherwise, developing countries will be unable to raise agricultural yields and end hunger, stop and reverse environmental degradation, or democratise energy access.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/15/civil-society-governance-diagnostic-report-on-sl-launched/,Civil Society Governance Diagnostic Report on SL launched,Author not found,0,2023-09-14T20:32:00+00:00,"The Civil Society Governance Diagnostic Report on the Anti-Corruption Landscape of Sri Lanka introduces a comprehensive set of governance reform recommendations designed to address the root causes of the current crisis in the nation. This report, the result of an in-depth study, identifies and prioritises key aspects of governance that require systematic attention from both a public opinion and economic governance perspective. This collaborative effort, reflecting the crucial socio-political moment of reform in Sri Lanka, was led by Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) in partnership with a core group consisting of Verité Research, the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA), Sarvodaya, People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) and the National Peace Council (NPC). Together, they formed the “Civil Society Initiative on Anti-Corruption Reform for Economic Recovery”, with the shared understanding that the country is in a governance crisis embedded in deep-rooted corruption, which must be addressed, if we are to strive towards actual, sustainable and equitable economic recovery. The report benefited from input provided by over 250 participants, representing diverse sectors, geographical locations, and ethnic, religious, and cultural groups. Prof. Arjuna Parakrama, an esteemed Researcher, conducted the research for the Civil Society Initiative. The High-Level Launch of the ‘Civil Society Governance Diagnostic Report on Sri Lanka’ took place on Wednesday, 13 September at the BMICH in Colombo. The event saw the participation of policymakers, representatives from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), diplomatic missions, international funding institutions, civil society organisations, academics, and distinguished guests from various other sectors. A quote from the Report underscores its urgency: “The current growing sense of economic injustice has been exacerbated by the fact that the architects of the economic crisis do not bear any part of the burden of its proposed reform, which has been, again, firmly thrust, without any public dialogue, on the victims of this very crisis.” Furthermore, it highlights, “Corruption is the core issue that determines the nature of the Sri Lankan polity. In fact, corruption has spread so far and wide that the country is currently facing imminent State Capture, which prevents public institutions from fulfilling their roles.” The report also reveals that among the high-probability and high-risk tactics used in Sri Lanka are the structural weakening of the country’s accountability framework, influence and interference with public officials, abuse of State-owned enterprises, manipulation of public procurement procedures, suppression of civil society, and the use of illicit financial transactions. Recommendations The Civil Society Governance Diagnostic Report on Sri Lanka presents a total of 34 main governance benchmark recommendations. These recommendations are categorised into three timeframes for implementation: immediate (0 – 6 months), short-term (up to 12 months), and medium-term (up to 24 months). They encompass measures aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability, improving macro-political-economic stability and sustainability, and fostering structural changes within the country. Below is a comprehensive list of these recommendations: Immediate (0 – 6 months): Measures to enhance transparency and accountability of existing systems Maintain a fiscal transparency platform that displays all information related to tax exemptions. Publish an annual report by 31 March each year, setting out the previous year’s expenditure variations against the approved budget, and explanations for the same. Quarterly publication of a revenue report detailing changes to revenue measures that might result in an annual revenue loss of 0.1% of GDP. Publish follow-up on actions taken to regularise qualified opinions of the Auditor General. Implement all the provisions of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act (FMRA), revised as appropriate, and ensure that non-compliance is penalised. Limit budget allocations under the development activities of the Department of National Budget (discretionary spending) to 3% of total expenditure. Reduce corruption and waste in relation to the benefits provided to political leaders and senior bureaucrats through enforcing systems of transparency and accountability.   Address the politicisation of the public service. Publish data related to all secondary market transactions of the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), with adequate detail to assess off-market rates of sale and purchase (as analysed by the forensic audits of the EPF published in 2019). Proactively disclose information relating to the project three months before commencement as outlined in the Right to Information Act. Quarterly publication of a complete set of updated information on public debt. Maintain an online platform that publishes all significant public procurement contracts when cumulatively above LKR 100 million to any set of connected suppliers. Ensure impartial implementation of the legal framework in the Anti-Corruption Act (ACA) for public access to asset declarations.  Hold national elections in accordance with the constitutionally mandated timeframe. Ensure enforcement of election campaign expenditure monitoring offences through by setting up an electronic system. Ensure the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption’s (CIABOC) readiness to investigate and apply the law effectively and equally. Publish all documents related to Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for all large-scale infrastructure projects in an online portal to ensure transparency. Protect and uphold civic space for citizen participation in all appropriate aspects of governance, including democratic dissent and protest.  Short-term (Up to 12 months): Measures to improve macro-political-economic stability and sustainability Amend all tax-related legislation to remove the excessive use of discretion for taxation changes without approved schemes. Fully implement the price and tax measures anticipated in the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (Article 6), to which Sri Lanka is a signatory. Achieve an annual reduction of 10% in the five-year average of tax exemptions (connected to Recommendation 1). Set up a Public Debt Management office external to the Central Bank.    Strengthen the National Procurement Commission for better oversight of public procurement and pass the Procurement Guidelines of 2019 with public consultation.  Conduct special audits on the ten State ministries/agencies with the lowest proportion (in value) of competitive bidding, and over LKR 10 billion in procurement. Establish a publicly accessible, online conflict-of-interest register.    Enact regulations for the transparent and accountable management of State enterprises.  Amend Parliamentary Standing Orders to better reflect continuity and accountability, especially to prevent disruption of the work of the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA), the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) each time Parliament is prorogued. Reduce unnecessary military expenditure by demilitarising the North and East of Sri Lanka, re-skilling military cadre prior to release, including handing back private and common State lands. Increase transparency and accountability of new social safety net cash transfers.  Ensure proper oversight and enforcement related to illicit financial flows (IFFs). Medium-term (Up to 24 months): Measures towards structural changes that are necessary to significantly reduce corruption risk and impunity Pass legislation on asset recovery in compliance with the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) with wide consultation, and ensure progress on key corruption cases, including those already commenced, with technical assistance from StAR (Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative). Establish a specialised independent corruption prosecution office with IMF technical guidance based on advising offices established in other countries. Alienate land for user-owned housing in the Malaiyaha Tamil areas, and provide living minimum wage for plantation sector workers (right to housing and livelihood). Change the composition and structure of the Constitutional Council so that there is a higher ratio of non-political representatives. For detailed information on the 34 Recommendations of the Report, please refer to the full report on www.tisrilanka.org. At the High-Level Launch, the Civil Society Initiative emphatically called upon the Government to prioritise these key recommendations in good faith, with support from development partners such as the IMF, World Bank and the Asian Development Bank."

Bank of Ceylon has stepped forward to sponsor such clean-up activities in six locations islandwide including Trincomalee Uppuveli, Venparei white rock, Casuarina Beach Jaffna, Trinco-Dutch Bay, Kayankerni, Batticaloa and Boiler Wreck – Batticaloa to clean the reefs in partnership with the Centre for Environmental Studies and Sustainable Development of the Open University of Sri Lanka, Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), Central Environment Authority, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, Local Government Authorities and other stakeholders. The total amount of waste collected from the BOC-sponsored sites in the clean-up is 438.65 kg which includes 220.8 kg recyclable waste and 217.85 kg non-recyclable waste. Masks and PET Bottles are the biggest source of waste found in the collection followed by food wrapping and shopping bags. Collected waste was sorted and sent for recycling with the support of registered plastic recyclers in adopting the latest sustainable practices hence resulting in a reduction of plastic waste that ends up in landfills or in the environment. Simultaneously, the non-recyclable plastic collections are disposed of in the dumping sites with the assistance of relevant Local Government Authorities. As part of the campaign, the OUSL has carried out an extensive education and awareness campaign regarding the health and environmental impact of plastics. Over the past year, BOC invested in CSR activities towards advancing climate actions under SDGs. In 2022, the Bank was able to save Rs 56.7 million worth of paper and toner through process automation while recycling 21.9 MT of paper under SDG number 12. As a leader in green and sustainable financing, BOC grants green financing loans while disbursing loans in accordance with the Central Bank’s taxonomy and nearly Rs 1 billion in funding for sustainable manufacturing in 2022. The Bank has introduced various loan products including loans for Solar, electric bikes, and biogas plants to advance the national sustainable agenda during the past year. Similarly, the Bank has introduced new green deposit products, Haritha Kekulu and BOC E-Thuru, and continues to promote among the Bank’s customer base."

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Despite issuing Gazette Notifications declaring the Railway as an essential service on Tuesday (11), the strike initiated by the Sri Lanka Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union continued for the second consecutive day yesterday (13). With railway unions threatening to resort to a fully-fledged TU action, the government appeared to have taken a step back and gone into defensive mode by last evening, just hours after the Department of Railways threatened 84 striking drivers to report to work immediately or face consequences as they would be ruled as vacated post. This was after the government  deciding to pass the ball to the Public Services Commission to resolve the matter. Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena, following a meeting of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on State Expenditure, chaired by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, informed the media that it was decided during the meeting that resolving this issue was beyond the capacity of the Cabinet. The Public Services Commission has been tasked with finding a possible solution. When asked whether it was difficult to solve the issue by declaring the Railways as an essential service and deploying military at railway stations, Gunawardena replied, “Yes, it is.” “We can’t act as village thugs when it comes to matters like this. That is why we decided to ask the State Services Commission to come up with a possible solution. Until then, I request drivers to report to work, as railways has been declared an essential service,” he said. Indika Dodangoda, convener of a coalition of railway unions, said yesterday that their decision to take action was a response to the Government’s disregard for their demands. Dodangoda said, “We noticed that the railway service was designated as an essential service. There are serious concerns regarding the legality of this decision. It is evident that the Government is attempting to curb trade unions through this measure,” and cautioned the Government that further attempts to suppress unions without addressing their grievances would inconvenience the public even more. Minister Guanwardena said sending termination letters to drivers would be considered, if they do not report to work today (14) as well. As a result of the strike, 128 train journeys were cancelled yesterday (13), severely inconveniencing the public. However, the Station Masters’ Union of Sri Lanka Railways said 139 train journeys were carried out as usual despite the strike.

The Attorney General made this remark, when a motion filed by Weeratunga, seeking an order to release cash contained in two of his frozen bank accounts, was taken up for hearing. This sum had been received by the accused, during the time the latter had served as the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Moscow. Through his motion, the former Sri Lankan Ambassador had stated that money contained in two of his bank accounts had been frozen after he was accused of illegally accruing it, while unlawfully intervening in the controversial MiG aircraft deal for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF). He has also been accused of alleged embezzlement of public funds, with regard to the procurement of MiG aircraft and money laundering. Weeratunga, in an affidavit, had previously mentioned to the Court, that the money that had been deposited in his accounts, had been the salary that he received, while functioning as the Envoy to Russia, over a period of nine years and the money which he saved, before the MiG aircraft scandal emerged.

However, even at present, efforts are being made to provide relief to the affected professionals due to the tax revision, said the officials. The officials of the Inland Revenue Department stated that a special programme has been started to add persons who are not involved in the tax process. Accordingly, a new taxpayer group registration programme (Bulk Registration) has been planned for this week. The committee meeting was held last week to discuss the concerns of the professionals who are affected by the APIT Tax and provide potential solutions. During the discussion, Committee Chairman MP Gamini Waleboda, said he will intervene to take the necessary measures to present amendments to the APIT Tax in the upcoming Budget. The trade union representatives expressed their opinions at length about what was expected from the tax amendments and whether the objectives have been achieved. The representatives said many professionals have been affected by the amendments made to the APIT Tax. The committee acknowledged the seriousness of the problem given that professionals left the country due to the tax issue. The Committee, therefore, assured the trade union representatives that the Government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are urged to resolve this issue. The Chairman pointed out the importance of preparing a policy on how taxes should be imposed for each profession and legislating it through Parliament in the future or when tax revisions take place. Thus, the Chairman instructed trade union representatives to prepare a report on the revisions to be made to the PAYE Tax within two weeks and submit it to the committee."

Officials representing the Ministry of Transport, Sri Lanka Transport Board, Ministry of Education and the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute were present before the committee Chaired by MP Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda. As a result, it was decided to provide a special training to a group of 50 technical students. It was discussed at length that although the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute was established with the objective of providing training to employees of the SLTB, the requirement is not being met properly. In this context, the SLTB has requested that 50 students recruited annually to the German Technical Training Institute to be trained in the Transport Board to fill the shortage of technicians in the SLTB. It was discussed that although 600 students were recruited for the full-time course as the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute Is held in high esteem, it is envisaged that these trainees may opt for other lucrative job opportunities.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/14/private-medical-colleges-threat-to-health-sector-mcpa/,Private medical colleges threat to health sector – MCPA,Author not found,0,2023-09-13T20:33:00+00:00," The Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association of Doctors (MCPA) warned that setting up private medical colleges for profit will lead to the collapse of health services in both the State and private sectors. MCPA President, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa, yesterday (13), accused the Government and the Health Minister of taking such decisions without proper consideration of the number of doctors required by the country, the number of medical practitioners leaving the country or the number of doctors required to run State and private sector health services. He pointed out that such a situation would only result in the collapse of the services and cast a shadow over the future of doctors emerging from these faculties. Several civil organisations staged a continuous sit-down protest (Satyagraha) outside the Health Ministry demanding the removal of Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, Health Secretary Janaka Sri Chandraguptha and several senior officials accused of corruption while calling for President Ranil Wickremesinghe to reveal the relevant agreements before setting up private medical colleges (PMCs). The MCPA President pointed out that the incumbent President had faced a severe defeat as the Prime Minister of the Government of Good Governance during the problems revolving around the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). “It is unfortunate that now as the President he was once more attempting to set up PMCs without learning from past mistakes,” he said. He alleged this was an attempt to create another crisis in the country. Dr. Sanjeewa lamented that no attempt had been made to resolve the crises in the State health service, observing that while none of the developed countries had started private medical schools, developing countries such as India, Bangladesh and Nepal had set them up to make money. “It has resulted in the question of the quality of medical services provided in those countries.” He noted that opening PMCs sans a proper knowledge of the situation would only result in the decline of the quality of the medical service provided. Dr. Sanjeewa lamented that doctors passing out from these medical schools would have to face further issues owing to the lack of postings in the private and State sector hospitals and would have to treat patients within kiosk-like spaces (petti kada). He noted that the private sector hospitals also needed only about 200 doctors. But since medical practitioners serving in the State sector also cater to private hospitals on an interim basis, the private sector hospitals don’t recruit enough permanent medical staff. The MCPA President said by producing a large number of doctors at the same time through private medical schools, exceeding the required numbers would reduce the job security of medical practitioners presently working in the State service. It would only result in more doctors leaving the country. He also urged the Health Minister to reveal to the public the nature of agreements made  with the PMCs, pointing out that the country’s entire health education system would be jeopardised should it turn out to be like the agreement that had been drawn up with SAITM. Such secrecy would only leave the students enrolled in those colleges and their parents in a dilemma, Dr. Sanjeewa warned.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The former minister and four others have been charged in the HC, with the depositing of an unlawfully accrued sum of Rs 30 million, in Gowers Corporate, while Rajapaksa had been functioning as a lawmaker. When the case was taken up, the five accused were present in Court. A leading witness for the Prosecution, Rohan Irugala, giving evidence in Court, had mentioned previously that the initial statements that he had given in the Kaduwela Chief Magistrate’s Court and to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) were false. However, he had stated that following advice received from his mother and wife, he had proceeded to give genuine statements before the Kaduwela Chief Magistrate and the FCID. These details were revealed to Court by Defence Counsel Sampath Mendis, PC. Mendis PC stated that the probe into the case had commenced on 27 July 2015 and that the statements from the witness had been recorded for the first time, only on 8 September of that year. Mendis PC told the Court, that as it had come to light that the mother of the witness concerned had died on 9 May 2015, it was clear, that all statements recorded from the witness, had been fabrications. He informed Judge Marasinghe, that the witness concerned had also provided questionable and confusing statements, regards the cheques related to the case in question. Nalin Marapana, PC, representing the other accused persons, told the Court that the Government that had assumed power at the time, had intentionally filed the case against its political opponents, based on false evidence and to victimise its political rivals. He added that to that end, the Government at the time, had even formed the FCID and set up Special Courts, to prosecute those harbouring political views in direct opposition to it. Hence, he urged the Court to issue an order for the acquittal of his clients, from the charges filed against them, without calling for submissions from the Defence. Thereafter, Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) Dilan Ratnayake appeared in Court on behalf of the Attorney General. He said the Court has been empowered by law, to arrive at a suitable decision, regards the veracity of statements provided by the witnesses to the Prosecution and that they anticipate a just and fair decision in this regard. SDSG Ratnayake, however, added that he would not oppose the submissions produced by the lawyers for the Defence. The Judge mentioned that whether the defendants will be released from the case or not without calling for submissions, will be announced on the said date. By Hansi Nanayakkara"

After a dominant victory over Pakistan, they faced a challenging encounter against Sri Lanka on a sluggish wicket where runs were hard to come by. For KL Rahul, it was an opportunity to scale up after a four-month-long hiatus that briefly made many believe he would be better off on the bench.  An 11th-hour injury to Shreyas Iyer opened the door for his inclusion in the Pakistan game, and Rahul proved why he is India’s best bet in the middle overs. In contrast to the Pakistan match, Rahul had to toil for his runs against Sri Lanka, facing a spin duo of Dunith Wellalage and Charith Asalanka, paying homage to Sri Lanka’s rich spin tradition. The ball spun consistently, but Rahul persevered, constructing a solid innings for himself until a moment of misjudgment led to his dismissal. “I didn’t get so much time to think about anything because it was so last moment,” Rahul said in the post-match press conference. “But I trusted my preparation in the last three or four months. I came to Sri Lanka thinking I would start in the playing XI, and that’s how I was preparing for it.  “When I played the first few balls, I tried to figure out the shots I could play on this pitch and accordingly diffuse the pressure. It was different against Pakistan because the ground allowed us to play more shots. But in this match, I am happy the shots I chose to play till I got out were good.” With India’s combination needing Rahul to bat at No.5 and keep wickets in the upcoming ICC World Cup in India, it was crucial to see how he was holding up against the likes of Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav. Fair to say, with the ball turning heavily, Rahul did a good job of judging the pace and getting an extremely important validation on his fitness level. The work that he has put in during the rehab process at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) helped him better himself."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/14/narco-control-funds-in-developing-countries-underutilised/,Narco control funds in developing countries underutilised,Author not found,0,2023-09-13T20:31:00+00:00," Funds for narcotics control provided for developing countries by donors, with prominent roles played by the United States, European Union, Japan and the United Kingdom, spent on projects in developing countries, were unspecified, an international report titled ‘Aid For The War on Drugs’, published by Harm Reduction International (HRI), a non-governmental organisation revealed. The organisation is committed to leveraging data and advocacy to advance harm reduction and promote reforms in drug policy. The report was launched in Colombo on 12 September. In 2021, more aid money for narcotics control overall was spent on projects in developing countries was unspecified. This is but one major example of many significant gaps in the data examined. The report says many records have only very brief entries in project description fields; some have no detail at all, or only code words used for the narcotics control projects in developing countries.  “One UK aid record, for example, says ‘Romeo / Delta / Foxtrot’ in its description, with no explanation. In 2021, when the US significantly increased the amount of its aid spent on narcotics control, most of its records were redacted (edited),” the report said. In total, aid funding for narcotics control has been channeled to 92 developing countries worldwide. For more detailed information on the top 20 recipient countries, it’s worth noting that some funds were also allocated to regional programmes, as indicated by the available data. The report continues to say at least 115 countries around the world criminalise even limited amounts of drugs for personal possession.  Wealthy and powerful countries, such as the US, China, and Russia continue to exert influence over drug policy globally. They do this through funding flows as well as the provision of material resources and technical assistance for counter-narcotics initiatives, and the ongoing promotion of a prohibitionist moral consensus. Some have described these power dynamics and imbalances affecting countries such as Colombia as narco-colonialism. This substantial financial support was contributed by numerous donors, with prominent roles played by the United States, European Union, Japan and the United Kingdom. Over the course of a decade, from 2012 to 2021, more than USD 974 million in aid funding was allocated for narcotics control projects in various countries across the globe. Civil society and journalists ought to advocate for increased transparency in the allocation and utilisation of aid funds and hold more extensive and comprehensive investigations into the allocation of funds for “narcotics control” in various countries noted the report. The US has not only assisted in the development of stringent drug laws but has also supported initiatives related to anti-drug awareness and education campaigns. Significantly, a portion of these funds, amounting to at least USD 70 million throughout the studied period, was directed towards countries that enforce the death penalty for drug-related offenses, the report says. This situation raises grave concerns regarding whether aid budgets have inadvertently supported regimes that carry out executions. In 2021, the largest individual recipient of such aid was Colombia, receiving USD 109 million, followed by Afghanistan with USD 37 million, Peru with USD 27 million, Mexico with USD 21 million, and both Guatemala and Panama, each receiving approximately USD 10 million.   Though data availability and transparency vary across projects and donors, this analysis reveals how aid money has supported approaches that undermine global development goals and “do no harm” principles. Analysis of this data reveals that aid donors have spent almost a billion dollars of this money on “narcotics control” efforts around the world. Specifically: at least USD 974 million was spent this way over the ten years between 2012- 2021. In Myanmar, the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) says it has not only helped to establish the country’s first national drug control policy, and build the capacity of the country’s Drug Enforcement Division (in partnership with the DEA), but it has also funded ‘the development of creative drug awareness campaigns in Burma’ (without further details disclosed).    UK aid for narcotics control declined over the 10-year period examined, from more than USD 10 million in 2012 to USD 2 million by 2019 and then to nothing by 2021. It is unclear what drove these changes – or for how long they will last. It is also not clear how UK aid spent on narcotics control aligned with the priorities of poverty reduction and gender equality enshrined in UK law. EU Institutions spent the second largest amount of aid on narcotics control between 2012- 2021. In several specific years, however, EU Institutions actually spent more aid like this than the US (for example, in 2016, they recorded USD 55 million in aid for narcotics control, versus USD 16 million from the US).   By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Several morning and evening office trains were cancelled, severely inconveniencing passengers, who were already at railway stations, especially in the morning. In a tragic turn of events, a student of the Moratuwa University lost his life, when he fell from the roof of a train at Horape, on the Kandy-Colombo run. The Police identified the deceased as W.W.I.D. Perera (18), hailing from the Moragoda in Gampaha. A senior official from the Railway Department announced that an investigation will be launched to determine the circumstances of this tragic incident. It is suspected that the young man may have fallen from the train’s roof after coming into contact with either a tree or a cable. In the evening, another passenger fell from a train, running on the main line, at the Bulagahagoda Substation and was subsequently admitted to Teaching Hospital Ragama. During this incident, a slow train bound for Gampaha was halted at the second platform. Simultaneously, a train moving in the same direction from the first platform struck a bag hanging on the back of a passenger, causing the passenger to fall. The injured individual is a young man estimated to be between the ages of 20 and 25. Sources have reported that he sustained injuries to his arm and spine as a result of the accident. As a result of trade union actions, a total of 118 scheduled train services had to be cancelled, causing significant inconvenience to the general public, as reported by the Sri Lanka Railways Station Masters’ Union (SLRSMU). The SLRSMU indicated that on the previous day (11), eleven scheduled train services had to be cancelled due to a lengthy trade union strike organised by the Railway Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union. However, in response to the strike, the Department of Railways took measures to provide some relief by running several train services on the following day. Specifically, four trains operated on the Kelani Valley line, while 12 trains were in service on the mainline. Additionally, six train services were available on the Puttalam line, and 12 on the coastal line. Furthermore, the Railways Department assured the public that all necessary arrangements had been put in place to ensure the operation of all night mail trains on that day.

Addressing the media at the Colombo Archbishop’s House, Spokesman for the Colombo Archdiocese, Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando yesterday (12), said the nation at large was aware that three commissions of inquiry and a parliamentary committee were appointed since the Easter Sunday attacks. Though they submitted reports and recommendations, none of them yielded the expected results, he charged, noting that only millions in public funds and precious time had been wasted.  Fr. Cyril Gamini said at the time the carnage took place President Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister in the government of good governance and PSCs were appointed by him at that time. “Therefore, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith and the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka have serious doubts as to whether another Parliamentary Select Committee would conduct an impartial and honest investigation. “Such a committee only aimed at misleading the public while incurring further wastage of time and money. Therefore, the Catholic Church of the country is unwilling to accept such a proposal,” he said. The Spokesman for the Colombo Archdiocese said urgent steps should be taken to initiate an unbiased, fair and transparent investigation of unexamined details surrounding the Easter Sunday attacks. He said the probe should be conducted under the extensive monitoring and supervision of an independent international investigation team. He stressed that the investigation team, appointed to conduct the independent probe, should include all investigators who have been transferred to different areas from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which conducted the initial investigation into the Easter Sunday attacks. Fr. Fernando said that all officers who were found guilty of having failed to prevent the attack by the Supreme Court but continued to serve in the Police Force should be suspended till the investigations were completed.

The best way to move forward is to work together to promote peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. This can only be achieved if we are willing to listen to each other and to learn from the past,” he said. Speaking further, Kongahage said he hopes that the Channel 4 documentary will spark a much-needed conversation about the Easter Sunday attacks and the challenges facing Sri Lanka today. “However, it is important to remember that this is a complex issue and that there is no easy solution. We must all work together to find a way to heal the wounds of the past and to build a better future for all Sri Lankans,” he said. He accused Channel 4 of attempting to blame the Easter Sunday terror attack on former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Kongahage argued that the attack was carried out by Muslim extremists who were motivated by their extremist beliefs and targeted innocent people. Kongahage expressed his disappointment with two individuals from Channel 4, who, along with Farasz Shaukath Ali (who currently resides in the United Kingdom), alleging that they deceived him by pretending to be from UK’s ITN. “They subsequently aired the interview on their own channel, distorting the truth,” he said. He added that a local channel had provided video footage related to the Easter Sunday terror attack. Kongahage accused the Diaspora of attempting to create tension between Sri Lanka and India. He believed that reconciliation in Sri Lanka could only be achieved if all citizens come together regardless of religious, communal, caste, or other divisive factors. He criticised Channel 4 for not being neutral and suggested that they catered to the Diaspora and LTTE loyalists, often placing blame solely on the Sinhala community. He claimed that there was evidence pointing to Muslim extremists as responsible for the Easter Sunday attack, citing discussions with former MP Ranjan Ramanayake and former CID Director Shani Abeysekara. Kongahage expressed support for an international investigation but insisted that they must be conducted impartially and fairly. He urged Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa to seek the truth, especially considering that his father was also a victim of the LTTE. Kongahage called for inquiries into LTTE-related murders, citing internationally recognised reports such as the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and those by Udulagama, Paranagama, among others.

Ceylon Today, in yesterday’s edition, revealed that despite the pledges, the Government has failed to implement the proposed system, which will enable the Department of Motor Traffic to conduct its operations o online. During the Cabinet media briefing yesterday (12), Gunawardena confirmed that the final decision to implement the e-motoring system had been taken. While Cabinet approval has already been obtained, the system’s launch will require additional time due to the necessity of receiving reports from several professional committees. “We have secured a building near Gangaramaya, in Colombo, for this purpose. This building must undergo evaluation by Government assessors, and we deem it essential to establish the necessary administrative infrastructure for the system,” he explained. Minister Gunawardana acknowledged that despite strenuous efforts, the current procurement and other procedural requirements are time-consuming. Attempting to bypass these processes could lead to accusations of programme mismanagement. Nevertheless, as a solution aimed at simplifying vehicle registrations, reducing corruption, and curbing fraudulent activities, the e-motoring system is expected to be operational by the end of this year, Gunawardena assured.

It has become important to monitor, as on average, 350 ships sail through Sri Lanka’s Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ) every day, increasing the risk of pollution from both accidental spills and illegal discharges. The French company is said to provide images when Sri Lanka wanted and they will be continuously monitoring the seas, MEPA Chairman Asela Rakeva said. He said the images will also look around ships and boats in the Sri Lankan waters and monitor the movements to track oil spills. The support from France was initiated two years ago when the Xpress Pearl disaster occurred in Sri Lankan waters. “The agreements were initiated and finalised during my tenure,” said former MEPA Chairman Dharshani Lahandapura and she added they had lengthy discussions with French delegates including French ambassador and CLS representatives. The French company developing satellite-based solutions for a sustainable planet and a leading player in maritime safety, is stepping up to help protect Sri Lanka’s waters with a pilot project, to detect and monitor marine oil spills for MEPA   Chairman Rakeva said. He said that Sri Lanka, nestled in the heart of the Indian Ocean with a strategic position along major shipping routes and boasting several commercial harbours managing over 5,000 ships annually, faces an elevated risk of oil pollution in its waters. Recent maritime incidents underscore this risk and emphasise the urgent need for a robust maritime disaster response mechanism. Recognising the importance to swiftly identify and address oil pollution occurrences  in Sri Lankan waters, as well as hold accountable those responsible, the collaborative endeavour, ‘Pioneering Project for Marine Oil Spill Detection and Monitoring in Sri Lanka’, generously funded by the French Government, marks a significant milestone. CLS Head of International Development, Sophie Besnard, added that CLS is proud to be involved in this initiative crucial to preserving Sri Lanka’s waters and maritime safety. “Working with dedicated partners and using state-of-the-art technologies, we are resolutely committed to preserving the environment and ensuring a sustainable future for Sri Lanka. We thank the Sri Lankan authorities and MEPA for putting their faith in us.” The project is financed by a grant from the French Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty of France and supported by the French Embassy in Sri Lanka, with the close collaboration of its Department of Treasury and Economic Affairs.

The Chinese investment team headed by Senior Business Manager Andrew Yang said Yan Oya reservoir could be used as a mega solar power generation platform by installing floating solar panels. Such a project could generate electricity for the national grid and also earn funds for completion of the Lower Malwathu Oya Project. The proposed project cost will be USD 160 million and in the first phase, floating solar panels will be placed on Yan Oya reservoir and generate 50 megawatt electricity that could be sold to the national grid. Once the MalwathuOya reservoir is completed in two years solar panels could be installed to adder another 50 megawatts. In addition to that MalawathuOya mini hydro system will generate 1,6 megawatts. Former Minister S. M. Chandrasena said the first survey and feasibility study for Lower MalwathuOya Project was done more than a decade ago when he was Deputy Minister of Irrigation. He thanked the Premier for the steps taken to resume the project that would irrigate land in Anuradhapura and Trincomalee districts to boost rice and cash crop production. The Chinese investors would assist the farmers to grow rice and cash crops and export part of the production to China.

However, 61.1% of the commitments in the resolution – which was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka – have seen ‘poor’ or ‘no’ progress, eight years since it was adopted in October 2015. The ‘UNHRC Monitor’ of Verité Research is the first and only monitor of its kind which objectively tracks the implementation of Resolution 30/1. A written update on Sri Lanka is scheduled to be delivered at the 54th Regular Session of the UNHRC on 11 September. Resolution 30/1 contained 36 distinct actionable commitments. Of these commitments, 7 (19.4%) are classified in the UNHRC Monitor as ‘complete’, 7 as ‘partial progress’ (19.4%), 18 as ‘poor progress’ (50%), and 4 as ‘no progress’ (11.1%). These commitments fall into five broad thematic categories: Rights and Rule of Law (15 commitments), Transitional Justice and Reconciliation (9), Security and Demilitarisation (7), International Engagement (3) and Power Sharing (2). The seven completed commitments are: (1) engage in broad transitional justice processes; (2) establish the Office on Missing Persons; (3) establish the Office for Reparations; (4) sign and ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances; (5) criminalise enforced disappearances; (6) continue engagement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the OHCHR; and (7) cooperate with special procedure mandate holders. There are seven commitments that remain partially fulfilled, including: (1) publishing previous presidential commission reports and (2) issuing Certificates of Absence to families of missing persons. Some of the key commitments which remain at ‘poor progress’ since 2015 are: (1) restore normality to civilian life; (2) investigate attacks on journalists, human rights defenders, religious minorities, and civil society; (3) hold perpetrators of these attacks to account; and (4) prevent such attacks in the future. The commitment to set up a judicial mechanism with a special counsel and foreign participation, to investigate violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, has remained at ‘no progress’ since February 2018. Since 2015, successive governments have also not made any progress on the commitment to review the Public Security Ordinance. At the 34th UNHRC session held in March 2017, the Sri Lankan government co-sponsored Resolution 34/1 – which reaffirmed the Resolution 30/1 commitments. At the 40th session in March 2019, the government co-sponsored Resolution 40/1, which also reaffirmed its commitments to reconciliation envisaged in Resolution 30/1. However, in February 2020, the Sri Lankan government informed the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) of its decision to withdraw from co-sponsorship of Resolution 40/1 of 2019, and its preceding resolutions 34/1 of March 2017, and 30/1 of October 2015. Verité Research has released analyses of progress in fulfilling the commitments in Resolution 30/1 in June 2016, March 2017, February 2018, March 2019, February 2020, February 2021, March 2022, February 2023 and August 2023."

One of the buses operates between Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, while the other serves the Hatton – Nuwara Eliya route. Meanwhile it was also found that a luxury bus, running between Hatton and Nuwara Eliya, had plied the route for approximately six years without obtaining a passenger transport licence. The investigating committee, appointed to address this issue, has taken action against several individuals. They have ordered the transfer of the manager of the Nuwara Eliya District Transport Service Authority, officials responsible for overseeing the matter and officers-in-charge of the Hatton and Nuwara Eliya bus stations. Moreover, the committee has recommended further disciplinary and legal measures be taken against those involved. Central Province Governor Lalith U. Gamage appointed a committee, headed by Central Province Cooperative Development Commissioner Amila Navaratne, about a month ago to conduct this investigation. Provincial Sports Director S.M.C. Samarakoon also serves as a committee member. The committee has found fault with the officers responsible for the Hatton and Nuwara Eliya bus stations and the road inspectors for their failure to monitor and report the bus in question, on the Nuwara Eliya – Hatton route, over the course of several years. Additionally, the committee holds the Acting Deputy General Manager (Running) of the Transport Service Authority’s main office, the Officer-in-Charge of Nuwara Eliya District Management M. Basnayake, and other officials from the Nuwara Eliya District Office accountable for not providing accurate reports and monitoring. The committee recommended that the financial losses incurred by the transport authority, due to the operation of a bus without a passenger transport licence for nearly six years, as well as the failure to maintain proper log sheets, should be calculated and charged from the officials who were responsible to oversee the route. Furthermore, the Central Provincial Road Passenger Transport Authority has lodged a complaint with the Police and initiated an investigation into another bus that has operated illegally between Kandy and Nuwara Eliya for an extended period.

Nearly 355 students participated. The seminar was to raise awareness among students and assist them in understanding and choosing a suitable profession from the diverse range of opportunities available, moving beyond traditional career paths. Shenal Kolonne, Vice President of Virtusa and Chairman of the sCommittee of the seminar, explained that the programme was designed to provide guidance to G.C.E. A/L students to select a suitable profession or higher education path while still in school or following graduation. He emphasised the importance of empowering students to make independent decisions about their future careers, free from pressure from parents or others.” Sri Lanka offers a wide array of professions, many of which can be lucrative, but due to a lack of awareness, many educated young individuals miss out on these opportunities. The goal is to nurture more professionals from this college who can contribute to the economic advancement of the country”, he further said. Kolonne pointed out that, unfortunately, many parents impose their own desires on their sons and daughters when it comes to selecting a G.C.E. A/L stream, often overlooking their children’s aptitude for specific subjects. This approach, he said does not benefit the students and can lead to compromising their future endeavours. Kolonne expressed confidence that St. Joseph’s College will produce a greater number of professionals capable of serving the nation and contributing positively to the country’s development. This initiative reflects a commitment to fostering informed and purposeful career choices among young students, ultimately benefitting both the individuals and the nation as a whole.

He also highlighted that President Wickremesinghe has taken steps to appoint a parliamentary select committee to investigate this issue. Additionally, then President Maithripala Sirisena had formed a committee to inquire into the Easter Sunday terror attacks. During a media briefing held at Sirikotha, Marasinghe said a committee, led by a former Supreme Court Judge, has been appointed to investigate allegations made in the Channel 4 video. Prof. Marasinghe emphasised that, as per former Attorney General Dappula de Livera’s statement, “any citizen can submit complaints or provide information regarding the individuals behind the Easter Sunday terror attacks. This is a right afforded to every citizen in Sri Lanka. Even the Cardinal, a revered religious figure, has the authority to share his concerns and information with the select committee regarding the attacks.” Marasinghe also pointed out that the Easter Sunday terror attacks led to the downfall of the UNP. “Recently, SLPP MP Dullas Alahapperuma announced his support for Opposition Leader Premadasa in the upcoming Presidential Election. This matter did not raise concerns previously, but the SJB’s decision to bring it up now seems indicative of the party’s struggles,” he said. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

The prolonged drought in the Rajarata region has left farmers frustrated, as they struggle to secure reasonable prices for their watermelon harvests. Currently, a kilo of watermelon is only fetching a meagre Rs 15 to Rs 20 at the Dambulla Economic Centre. Farmers say the journey to the Dambulla Economic Centre to sell their harvest is both costly and burdensome.  Sumit Kumara, a farmer from Megodawewa, shared his plight, “When a drought strikes, we cultivate watermelons with the limited water available in our wells. Cultivating half an acre cost us approximately Rs 70,000. Regrettably, we are unable to secure a fair price for our harvest. It’s disheartening to sell our hard-earned produce for a mere Rs 15 to Rs 20. This problem has plagued us for nearly two decades and our survival is at stake. We struggle to access essential resources like oil and fertiliser and the drought adds to our woes. We are left with no option but to contemplate drastic measures. We earnestly appeal for watermelons to be purchased at a minimum of Rs 70-Rs 80 per kg. When we go to the Dambulla market, we have to sell five kg of watermelons just to cover restroom expenses.” Sudarshani Lanka, another farmer said, “We have invested our savings, including our gold and land, into farming. Unfortunately, we are now in a situation where we can’t even afford to safeguard those assets. We have devoted nearly everything to farming and yet, we are not generating any income. If this situation persists, we may have no choice but to resort to extreme measures. We demand fair pricing of at least Rs 70-Rs 80 per kg for watermelons.” BY Krishnan Sachin – Maradankadawala"

Reliable sources indicated that Harak Kata had received assistance from a Police Constable (PC) in his unsuccessful attempt to steal the firearm. Following the thwarted effort, the PC had fled the scene. According to these sources, Harak Kata, a notorious illegal drug trafficker and leader of an organised crime ring, was summoned to the CID for questioning on 10 September. Subsequently, the PC, who had aided the suspect drug kingpin, offered a parcel of homemade milk toffees to the officers present. Alarmingly, two of the officers who consumed the toffees subsequently lost consciousness. During the interrogation, Harak Kata requested a visit to the washroom and the handcuffs restraining him were reportedly loosened by the PC in question. Upon his return to the interrogation room, Harak Kata made a desperate attempt to forcibly seize the firearm of a Special Task Force (STF) SI. Fortunately, the SI managed to wrestle with Harak Kata, thwarting his bid to steal the weapon and bringing the situation under control. However, the PC, who had assisted Harak Kata’s efforts to steal the SI’s firearm, had vanished from the scene. Law enforcement authorities have deployed several Police teams to locate and arrest the PC. Harak Kata, who was deported to the country, is currently held under detention orders by the CID for further interrogation and investigation into this incident. BY Keerthi Mendis"

Additionally, the Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Association and railway yard workers went on strike in the morning of 11 September, due to the non-payment of incentives to railway employees working in railway yards for several months. This strike resulted in the cancellation of six train services scheduled for operation this morning, and one long-distance train bound for Kandy at 10.40 a.m. from Colombo Fort was also cancelled. The strike was called off after the GMR provided assurances on 11 September. The GMR promised to settle their incentive payments by 25 August.

He emphasised that these forthcoming medical institutions will adhere to the high standards set by the existing medical schools in the country. Speaking at a media briefing, held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (11), Rambukwella provided insights into this initiative. He said, “The Cabinet has already given its approval to launch three new medical colleges. These institutions must maintain the same high standards as our existing medical schools. We must consider the number of our youth who choose to study in private institutions or abroad. It is our moral duty to provide adequate facilities and opportunities for our country’s children.” Furthermore, the Minister emphasised, “Professors who have worked as consultants in the medical colleges of our country have outlined minimum qualifications. There is a law that mandates other recognised medical schools in this country to meet or exceed these standards. Additionally, three hospitals have been integrated into these universities.” Rambukwella noted that these universities have been encouraged to allocate scholarships to 10% of their student population, recognising that there are qualified students who may face financial barriers to pursuing a medical education. Addressing concerns about the emigration of medical professionals, the Minister attributed this trend to economic challenges faced by the country in 2019. He reassured that the government is dedicated to addressing these issues, especially those related to doctors’ remuneration. He also stressed the importance of developing comprehensive short, medium, and long-term plans to tackle these challenges, highlighting that countries like England offer significantly higher salaries to medical professionals educated in Sri Lanka’s free education system. In furtherance of their commitment to address critical healthcare challenges, the government aims to augment the intake capacity in specific domains. While there are currently stipulated minimum qualifications and approximately 13 medical faculties throughout the country, only around 2,000 individuals are admitted to these institutions. Rambukwella emphasised the need to expand these numbers to provide opportunities to aspiring medical professionals with foundational qualifications."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Rajakumari, a domestic worker. Three of the four suspects, comprising two Police Sergeants and a Constable, were initially scheduled to participate in an identification parade yesterday (11). However, the identification parade was postponed by a week following objections raised by the accused. Additionally, Attorney-at-Law Senaka Perera, representing the aggrieved party, informed the Court that he had received information suggesting that the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Welikada Police Station, who was previously transferred following Rajakumari’s death, had been reinstated in the same position. He expressed concerns that this development could potentially impede the ongoing investigations into the housemaid’s tragic demise. However, no specific order pertaining to this matter was issued by the Magistrate. R. Rajakumari, a 41-year-old resident of Badulla, was arrested on 11 May  following a complaint by her former employer, Sudharma Nethicumara, who alleged that Rajakumari had stolen her gold jewellery. Tragically, Rajakumari died while in the custody of the Welikada Police, leading her relatives to raise suspicions of assault. On 25 August, Magistrate Kekunawala directed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to arrest the suspects involved in the housemaid’s death.

The government is sadly under a misconception if it thinks that the current brain drain issue could be resolved by setting up private medical faculties. It takes approximately seven years for an MBBS qualified medical practitioner to pass out. It takes about 15 years to produce a board-certified consultant. Therefore, how does the government expect to find solutions to the current issue by setting up private medical colleges, he queried. Also, priority should be given to settling the issues faced by State-run medical faculties. Some of them are in the process of being accredited whereas the Medical Faculty in Moratuwa University does not have proper building and has to currently use the General Hospital Nagoda for clinical training purposes. Sabaragamuwa Medical Faculty does not have a proper professorial unit while the Rajarata Medical Faculty has issues regarding staff to function its professorial units. He warned that if proper attention is not paid the international accreditation given to State run medical faculties would suffer a serious setback.   President Wickremasinghe recently said that plans have been made to establish the first non-government medical faculty in Sri Lanka, in a move to expand medical education opportunities and find solutions to the challenges posed by the shortage of doctors.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Being one of the leading suppliers of Power, Tea and Agricultural commodities, G&G Group forays into the trading of agricultural commodities across the range of products from Soybean, Wheat, Barley, Copra and many other products. The G&G Group which always strives for excellence, has a team of highly-experienced and qualified-professionals to manage its businesses and investments across the business contours. The conglomerate has also heavily invested in the Renewable Energy, Tea Plantation, Food Processing, Agro commodity business across Asia.  Demerged from the Watawala Plantations PLC and coming under the wings and becoming a part of the G&G Group in 2017, with a strong focus on innovation and value addition, Hatton Plantations consolidated its position as one of the largest tea producing plantation companies in Sri Lanka. Over the years, Hatton Plantations continues to build upon the established and proud reputation of being a prime producer of pure Ceylon tea and continues to set new standards in ensuring the people around the globe to enjoy a quality cup of tea. Sri Lanka is an Island Nation with a rich biodiversity located in the Indian Ocean. The country’s economy is highly-based on textiles, tourism, tea exports, rice, and other agricultural products. Sri Lankan tea production is well known around the world as ‘Ceylon Tea’. According to the statistics of the Sri Lanka Exports Development Board, tea exports account for about 11% of the total exports, and about 62% contribute to the total agriculture exports in the country.When looking at the tea industry in Sri Lanka, the Government and private plantations are the key components of gaining this huge amount of foreign income to the country. In the complex process of manufacturing tea, plantation employees play a vital role to have a production of best quality under the guidance and supervision of the management.  Tea harvesters in Sri Lanka can be defined as one of the main contributors to a better output in the tea industry. ‘Tea plucking’ is a skill that women have assimilated, picking tender tea shoots with their nimble fingers. As one of the pioneer Ceylon tea producers in Sri Lanka’s G&G Groups, Hatton Plantation PLC recently declared a new chapter of utilising female cadres, other than as the tea pickers, in the history of Sri Lankan tea plantations. The company introduced female harvesting team leaders for 14 tea estatesof Hatton Plantations located in the Central Highlands as an innovative strategy. ‘Kankani’ are the personnel, who are in charge of supervising female tea pickers and in the long-standing history of the tea industry this was designated to male cadre. With introducing of the new strategy, these new female harvesting team leaders are streamlined as supervisors of female tea pickers by the Hatton Plantation PLC, recognising the need for psychosocial factors in the long run towards a better industry. The specialty of this programme is that, these harvesting team leaders have been selected from the same community of estate harvesters, considering their educational qualifications, personalities, communication skills and also subsequent to a proper interview procedure. Most of them are from the families of tea harvesters who had been retired after rendering a valuable contribution to the national economy of Sri Lanka. The aim of this new strategy is to have a close communication whilst ensuring the mental stability of women and as a motivational drive to go through any condition by avoiding negative feelings like insecurity, helplessness, and having no voice for them. After primary selections from interviews, these young female individuals had to go through a 3-week-long training programme that included modules on tea harvesting and plowing, techniques and skills, and cost-effectiveness. Further, they will learn agricultural practices to understand the challenges and opportunities related to the tea industry. They were specially trained on the role of supervisor, to ensure their work’s competency, efficiency and effectiveness. Similarly, prior to getting into the field, they will sharpen more by undergoing the leadership module, the effective communication module, resolving conflicts under the four steps of communication, active listening, reviewing opinions which ends with win-win solutions.  Finally, by managing the performance goals of the team members, leading and working together with the team, leading and managing unforeseen situations and also safety and security, will make them competent in carrying out their duties in an organised manner. Hatton Plantations PLC recently conducted two training programmes for female harvesting team leaders (1st programme for eight personnel and 2nd programme for 12 personnel). The Human Resources Management Department of the Company streamlined the process under the direction of the Chairman, Hatton Plantation PLC, Gary Seaton, the executive director and other directors of the company. The certificates awarding ceremony for the 12 female plucking supervisors was held at the headquarters of Hatton Plantation PLC on 31 August 2023. Menaka Athukorala, Executive Director, Hatton Plantations PLC, K. Gowri Shankar, Group Director, Corporate Strategies & Investments, G&G Group of Companies, Singapore, and a few senior head office staff members attended the ceremony. Gowri Shankar speaking during the day’s ceremony, after awarding certificates and offer letters to graduates said, “I am highly impressed with this new strategy, which can provide suitable employment and sustainable opportunities to the families of our existing workers. We want them to excel and climb up the ranks within the organisation. It was their ancestors who took care of the estates and we believe the legacy and  tradition should continue but with modern methods and means, that’s guided by deep commitment towards sustainability . I am confident they will succeed and bring more efficiency and innovation to the industry as they are well-educated and trained.” Menaka Athukorala said, “This will motivate and enhance female tea pluckers, their communities, and those who are employed as new young harvesting team leaders to climb the ladder with career prospects to be experts in the sector, foundation we laid today.” Thamilini Shramiladevi, one of the newly-appointed harvesting team leaders, expressed her gratitude to the G&G Groups, Hatton Plantations, and all the officials for empowering and giving them a platform to excel. “We are ready to take any challenge and confident to carry out the responsibilities entrusted to us.” With this new chapter, we can enhance sociocultural enrichments by filling communication gaps. Similarly, each of the 14 estates of G&G Groups, Hatton Plantation are conducting a series of charity events for the betterment of community of estate sector. Specially, nutrition programmes for the pregnant and mothers with infants, educational assistance for schooling kids, medical camps, housing projects, infrastructure development, fulfilment facilities for sanitary needs are just a glimpse . Every industry needs new strategies and innovation aligned with best practices. Such allocations have a huge value in the short and long run. In today’s context such innovative strategies will empower women and give them equal opportunity to remove the gender inequality."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/11/two-more-committees-to-probe-easter-carnage/,Two more committees to probe Easter carnage,Author not found,0,2023-09-10T20:36:00+00:00," Following Britain’s Channel 4’s controversial documentary, another two committees are to be appointed, by President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Government, to probe the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said yesterday (10). If these proposed committees are appointed, they will be the third and fourth appointed to probe the carnage, in which a total of 269 people were killed, including at least 45 foreign nationals, three Police officers and eight suicide bombers. An additional 500 were injured in the terror attack. According to the PMD, President Ranil Wickremesinghe would appoint a committee led by a retired Supreme Court Judge, with the primary mission of investigating serious allegations recently brought to light by Channel 4 in a broadcast video. These allegations have ignited public concern, especially as former Attorney General Dappula de Livera has made similar claims, suggesting the presence of a mastermind behind the devastating Easter bomb attack. In response, the Government is preparing to establish a Parliamentary Select Committee specifically tasked with probing these disturbing assertions, the PMD said. “Recognising the gravity of the situation, the President is committed to conducting a comprehensive review of all available information. As part of this effort, the reports will be presented to the Parliament, along with the existing Parliamentary Select Committee report on the Easter bomb attack and the Presidential Commission report on the same tragic event,” the PMD said. On 21 April 2019, Easter Sunday, three churches in Sri Lanka and three luxury hotels in the commercial capital, Colombo, were targeted in a series of coordinated IS-related terrorist suicide bombings. Later that day, two smaller explosions occurred at a housing complex in Dematagoda and a guest house in Dehiwala. Security lapses leading to the attack and the Sri Lankan Government’s failure to act on intelligence were highlighted during inquiries into the attacks. On 12 January 2023, The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka ruled that the then-incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena and several other State authorities at the time failed to act on intelligence and they were ordered to pay compensation to victims. In 2019, just a day after the terror attacks, then President Maithripala Sirisena appointed a PCoI, headed by Supreme Court Justice Vijith Malalgoda. The PCoI handed over its report to Sirisena on 10 June 2019. In May 2019, a PSC was appointed to probe the attacks and incidents in its aftermath by then Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. The Select committee was headed by then Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri and included seven MPs. The PSC report was presented to Parliament on 23 October 2019. Sirisena appointed another PCoI on 20 September 2019, headed by Supreme Court Justice Janak de Silva. The final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Easter Sunday attacks was handed over to then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa by Justice Janak de Silva on 1 February 2021. The first and second interim reports were handed over to the then President on 20 December 2019 and on 2 March 2020. The full PCoI report was not disclosed to the public, by the authorities, citing national security reasons. However, it was reported that the full report was handed over to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena by the Presidential Secretariat on 22 February 2022, on the instructions of President Gotabaya  Rajapaksa. Meanwhile, Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles Minister handed over the full report to the Catholic Church on 25 April. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

In a statement, the Director for Strategic Communications at ICTA verified that numerous government offices, including the Cabinet Office, using the ‘gov.lk’ email domain, were affected by this data loss.

Despite the approved total staff count being 1,992, the actual number of employees stands at 1,390. This shortfall could pose a challenge to the continuity of services provided by the SuwaSeriya Foundation. Additionally, it was noted that 25 ambulances, obtained through a finance lease system in 1990, remained parked in the supplier’s lot for over a year-and- a- half without being used. The reason attributed is incomplete infrastructure improvements required to align the services with those offered by the SuwaSeriya Foundation. The official also pointed out that the procurement of the ambulances, conducted by the National Budget Department, was done without necessary specifications for a hospital care ambulance and without appointing any representative from the 1990 SuwaSeriya Foundation to the Technical Evaluation Committee. Further, there is insufficient information regarding the value of these ambulances, with some individuals treating such details as confidential documents. Established in 2016, the SuwaSeriya Foundation’s mission is to prevent accidents, diseases and emergencies, rapidly and effectively respond to emergency situations and aid in the rehabilitation of individuals following illness and injury.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/09/dengue-prevention-control-compromised/,"Dengue prevention, control compromised",Author not found,0,2023-09-08T20:31:00+00:00," With the Health Ministry owing over Rs 100 million (Rs 10 billion) in arrears, the provision of reagents – especially to conduct full blood count tests on possible dengue cases has been hard hit. President of the College of Medical Laboratory Science Sri Lanka (CMLSSL), Ravi Kumudesh lamented on Friday (8), that this situation posed a severe threat to the FBC tests conducted by State Hospitals as the four companies which sold machine-specific reagents to conduct the test were on the verge of stopping the provision of their reagent. There are State-run Hospitals that have two to three such testing machines, but unfortunately with the Health Ministry’s failure to pay its dues for the reagents purchased, some of the companies have stopped selling the reagent for the FBC test. Therefore, that particular machine cannot be used to conduct the test. Risk Kumudesh noted that this situation posed a severe risk to dengue patients as it was most important to conduct the FBC test and issue the test result in at least half-an-hour which would enable the initiation of treatment and management of dengue at the earliest. However, the present situation may result in the Hospital laboratory staff being unable to conduct the test at all. State hospitals that have two to three FBC testing technologies would also be unable to use them to cater to the need, especially if the number of cases being tested were high. Solution  The CMLSSL President said, his outfit had researched and proposed possible solutions to this issue. The situation itself created a monopoly with the Health Ministry being dependent on those particular companies to provide the reagent for their equipment. However, this situation can be ‘tweaked’ if the Health Ministry is willing to call for tenders on the basis that the company that bided the lowest amount would have the machine that had been sold by it functioning. If the Health Ministry wished it could follow the example of India and invite outside companies to also bid for the reagent tender, he said. However, with the mindset of some of the Health Ministry’s officials bent on corruption the proposal made by the College to the Ministry over 1-1/2 years ago has met with a deafening silence from the Health Ministry’s side.     Situation report While several efforts to contact the Director of the National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) failed, a situation update sent by the Unit noted that by 8 September a total of 62,601 dengue cases had been recorded.   A total of 13 high-risk Medical Officer of Health areas had been recorded by the 34th week of this year according to the Dengue Sentinel Site Surveillance System (DenSys). 48.7 per cent of the dengue cases were from the Western Province. It should be noted that by this time Colombo has overtaken the Gampaha District by recording 116 more cases. The Colombo District from January till date has recorded 13,265 cases, while Gampaha has recorded 13,139 cases. The Central Province has 10.5 per cent dengue cases (Kandy – 5,237), the North Western Province 8.4 per cent (Puttalam – 3,005, Kurunegala – 2,237) and Sabaragamuwa has 8.3 per cent (Ratnapura – 2,587, Kegalle – 2,600) of dengue cases. A total of 38 dengue deaths have been recorded in the country to date. ‘Our lives are our responsibility’ Fielding questions, an NDCU Spokesperson said, although there wasn’t a steep rise in the number of dengue cases being recorded in the country at present, the heavy and intermittent showers in South West monsoons would give way to a rise in numbers towards the latter part of this year. However, it would be helpful if the public changed their attitude towards the dengue control work being carried out. “They should keep in mind that their environs should be kept clean at all times of possible mosquito breeding places and not just to avoid being issued with a red notice or having a fine slapped on them for having mosquito breeding grounds. But this is what happens most often. People want to temporarily avoid the unpleasantness and carry out frenzied cleaning programmes.”     Civic duty People of this country bear a responsibility to the community to ensure that their behaviour does not pose a threat or hinder another’s life. “Cleaning up their environs should be everyone’s sincere motto as that is possibly the only way in which communities in all parts of the country would be able to battle and overcome dengue for their own sake and the sake of their children.” By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

According to the report presented to Parliament, by 31 December 2022, a total of 4,756 km of electric fences was erected in an effort to mitigate Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Regrettably, there has been an alarming increase in elephant fatalities, human casualties, property damage and physical harm over the past five years, the report revealed. According to the National Audit Office, a disturbing total of 1,867 elephant fatalities and 618 human casualties occurred between 2018 and 2022, with a noticeable spike in 2022 compared to previous years. The issue of wild elephant deaths has become increasingly prevalent in recent times. Meanwhile, the Centre for Environment and Nature Studies (CENS) has reported that 3,765 wild elephants have perished over the past 12 years, from 2010 to 2022, based on information obtained through the Right to Information (RTI) Act. Also, data from the Department of Wildlife Conservation indicates that 276 elephant fatalities have been recorded in the first nine months of this year alone. Former Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera recently announced plans to conduct an elephant census in Sri Lanka in 2023. He stressed the importance of acquiring accurate data on the current wild elephant population in Sri Lanka to effectively address the HEC. The last official wild elephant census took place in 2011, during which the wild elephant population was estimated to exceed 5,000. Unofficial sources suggest that the current wild elephant population may approach 7,000. Moreover, a high-ranking official from the Wildlife Department also revealed that over Rs 2.2 billion was spent in 2021 – 2022 to establish and maintain electric fences aimed at mitigating the HEC. Despite these efforts, 439 elephants lost their lives, 145 human lives were tragically lost and more than 2,660 instances of property damage, as well as nearly 200 cases of physical harm, were reported during the same year.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/08/gotabaya-vehemently-refutes-channel-4-allegations/,Gotabaya vehemently refutes Channel 4 allegations,Author not found,0,2023-09-07T20:35:00+00:00,"Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa vehemently refuted the allegations made against him, in the recent ‘Dispatches’ documentary by British television network Channel 4, concerning the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka. In a statement, Rajapaksa characterised the video as “largely an anti-Rajapaksa diatribe aimed at tarnishing the Rajapaksa legacy from 2005 onwards and is a collection of falsehoods, much like the previous films broadcast by the same Channel.” This statement comes on the heels of the broadcast of Channel 4’s investigative film titled ‘Sri Lanka’s Easter Bombings,’ which delved into the 2019 terror attacks that targeted several churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka, resulting in the tragic deaths of more than 260 people and leaving hundreds wounded. The Channel 4 exposé levelled serious allegations against senior State officials, suggesting that they were involved in a plot to instigate insecurity in the country to facilitate Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s victory at the 2019 Presidential Election. The former Head of State dismissed as ‘absurd’ the notion that a group of Islamic extremists carried out suicide attacks with the aim of ensuring his presidency. “Major General Sallay had informed Channel 4 that he had been removed from the position of Director of Military Intelligence and was serving in Malaysia as Minister-Counsellor from 2016 to December 2018 and that he had not been in Sri Lanka at the time this meeting is said to have taken place. Furthermore, from January to November 2019 he was in India following the National Defence College course and during this entire period from 2016 to 2019, he was not operative within the defence or security structure of Sri Lanka. After Maj. Gen. Sallay was removed from Military Intelligence in 2016, he never served in that organisation again. It was only after I became President that he rejoined the intelligence apparatus as the Head of the State Intelligence Service from December 2019 onwards. Hence, this story about Maj Gen Sallay meeting the suicide bombers in February 2018 is clearly a fabrication.  In order to bolster their claim that Military Intelligence was in league with the suicide bombers, the film alleges that when the Police started investigating the Vavunativu incident of 30 November 2018, where two Policemen were killed and their weapons stolen and the discovery of explosives at the Wanathawilluwa safe house on 16 January 2019, the Military Intelligence had sabotaged the Police investigations. All Sri Lankans are aware that the Government of 2015-2019 persecuted the intelligence services and particularly the Military Intelligence and that that quite a few of its members spent months and years in remand and in Police custody during that period. Hence, any claim that the Military Intelligence could sabotage Police work during the 2015 – 2019 Government, is plain nonsense,” Rajapaksa said. “One of the allegations made against me and my government in this latest film is that after becoming President, I ‘sabotaged’ the investigation by transferring officers carrying out the investigation. I assume that this is a reference to the former Director of the CID Shani Abeysekera. Leaked telephone recordings had revealed that he had conspired with a politician to influence the outcome of an ongoing criminal case in the High Court, and he could not be kept in a position of responsibility in the CID under any circumstances by any government. The Police Officers attached to the Presidential Commission to investigate the Easter Sunday attacks were not transferred after I came into power. In any case, there was a gap of nearly seven months between the Easter Sunday attacks and my coming into power, and investigations should have been carried out during that period. SSP Abeysekera was also one of those responsible for the negligence between 2016 and 2019 mentioned in the Presidential Commission’s report,” he claimed. Rajapaksa categorically denied the allegations made by one of the high-ranking whistleblowers interviewed by Channel 4. “This whistleblower claimed to have facilitated a meeting between members of the Islamic extremist group led by Zahran Hashim and the then Army Intelligence Chief, Major General Suresh Sallay, in January 2018, prior to the tragic events. “The whistleblower, Hanzeer Azad Maulana, had previously served as a spokesman for the LTTE’s breakaway group, Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pullikal (TMVP), led by the current State Minister of Rural Road Development, Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, also known as Pillaiyan. Maulana, who is currently seeking political asylum in Switzerland, reportedly provided testimony to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and was interviewed by European intelligence agencies. Maulana claimed to Channel 4 that he witnessed the alleged meeting between the suicide bombers and a senior Sri Lankan intelligence officer before the Easter Sunday attacks. However, Sallay informed Channel 4 that he had been removed from his position as Director of Military Intelligence and had been serving as Minister-Counsellor in Malaysia from 2016 to December 2018. He stated that he had not been in Sri Lanka at the time of the alleged covert meeting.” Rajapaksa, in his press release, emphasised that he had no contact with Sallay until he was elected president in 2019, after leaving his role as Defence Secretary in 2015. Despite Channel 4 describing Sallay as one of his close associates, Rajapaksa categorically denied this claim. “Despite the politically motivated accusations being made against me by certain individuals, I have personally done everything possible to help the Roman Catholic community when I held government office. After the war ended, I helped in the restoration and reconstruction of the Madhu Church and the Church in Mullikulam. I also helped facilitate the arrangements to invite His Holiness the Pope to Sri Lanka and I headed the committee formed by the then government to organise the visit. I also played a key role in the construction of the Benedict XVI Catholic Institution of Higher Education in Bolawalana. I worked very closely with His Eminence the Cardinal during that period,” the former President concluded."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

A total of 103 MPs voted in favour of the Bill while 58 MPs voted against it. The Bill was taken into debate after the Supreme Court determined that it could be passed with a simple majority in Parliament. Meanwhile, the Committee on Public Finance (COPF), chaired by Dr. Harsha de Silva, approved the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill by a majority, at the Committee meeting held on the same day in Parliament. The majority approval for the said Bill was preceded by discussions at length pertaining to the particulars of the Bill. Committee Chair Dr. de Silva and MP Patali Champika Ranawaka abstained from casting their votes. The Central Bank (CBSL) officials clarified that the 30 per cent tax increase, as stipulated by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill, applies only to the interest income on the bond portfolio. Furthermore, it was highlighted that in the event that superannuation funds do participate in the Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR), this will be reversed to 14 per cent. The Committee also questioned the ability of the CBSL to guarantee the proposed rate of a 12 per cent return until 2025 and nine per cent thereafter to the superannuation funds participating in the DDR. In response, the CBSL Governor stated that it is not possible to guarantee the return to each member; however, he assured them that they will strive to achieve the proposed return. He further mentioned that in the event that this rate cannot be maintained, there is an ongoing discussion for the treasury to step in to ensure the proposed return until 2025. The committee expressed the opinion that a forthcoming amendment should consider an inflation-adjusted interest rate to guarantee a positive return for EPF members. The CBSL Governor also revealed that if the EPF participates in the DDR, the opportunity loss to the EPF bond portfolio is four per cent. However, should the EPF choose not to participate, the opportunity loss to the bond portfolio increases to 21 per cent due to the higher tax rate of 30 per cent as per the latest amendment to the Inland Revenue Bill. Additionally, it was observed that all superannuation funds not eligible for the DDR will be subjected to a 30 per cent tax increase, potentially discouraging the formation of new superannuation funds in the future. Furthermore, the committee, whilst congratulating CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, for being named among the 21 Bank Governors, listed in the Global Finance Magazine’s Central Banker Report for 2023, also commended the efforts of the officials present. State Ministers Premitha Bandara Tennakoon, Dr. Suren Raghavan, Dr. Seetha Arambepola, Anupa Pasqual, MPs Wajira Abeywardana, Johnston Fernando, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Chandima Weerakkody, Nimal Lanza, U.

GNOA Secretary, Ajith Ratnayake alleged the nurses of the ward, in which the eight-year-old was being treated, had received death threats while a few people had even protested outside the Teaching Hospital Jaffna yesterday (7), demanding that the nurses in connection with the incident be taken into custody. “While respecting their right to protest, we emphasise that such influence is justified after reasonable investigation into the said incident,” he said. Ratnayake urged the Health Ministry to initiate a probe parallel to the internal investigation being carried out by the Teaching Hospital. It is also the duty of health authorities to take appropriate measures if an unfair situation was reported.  Explaining the incident, the GNOA Secretary said, the eight-year-old, who had been suffering from fever, was brought to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital on Sunday night (3), after initially being treated for fever in the private sector as her condition did not improve. Ratnayake said, the ward staff on duty at the time had suspected that the girl must have been administered treatment through a vein on her hand as her hand had been swollen even at the time of admission. A cannula had been inserted to the same hand in order to administer a drug upon admission with medical advice. The child’s family members had informed the ward’s nursing staff of the girl’s discomfort, while they in turn had informed the relevant doctors, he said.  Several doses of the drug were administered to the eight-year-old under medical supervision which led to the unfortunate situation in which the child’s hand had become numb. Acting Deputy Director General (Medical Services) Dr. G. Wijesuriya said, a committee, comprising specialists and senior nurses, has been appointed to investigate whether the cannula was at fault or if there were other factors involved. He noted that the committee’s findings would shed light on the incident. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/08/ports-authority-under-increased-scrutiny/,Ports Authority under increased scrutiny,Author not found,0,2023-09-07T20:33:00+00:00," The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) is facing increased scrutiny following revelations, of multiple administrative weaknesses and irregularities, during a recent investigation conducted by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE). One of the key outcomes of the COPE inquiry is the recommendation for the SLPA to submit a proposal within the next three months. This proposal should outline strategies for enhancing revenue, improving cost management, and increasing overall operational efficiency within the organisation. Another significant area of concern is the non-payment of funds to the Consolidated Fund, spanning the period of 2016 to 2021. COPE has initiated an investigation to address this issue and ensure accountability. Additionally, the committee has raised questions about the failure to amend a contract worth USD 282.56 million. This contract was intended for the purchase of 12 oversize cranes and 40 automatic gantry cranes, with the goal of maximising the operational capacity of the east terminal. A startling discovery was the reduction in container handling capacity at the Colombo Port, which has declined from 81% in 2001 to a mere 28% by 2022. This decline raises concerns about the efficiency of port operations. Further investigations have revealed a decrease in the number of ships arriving at the Ports of Colombo, Galle, and Trincomalee from 2018 to 2022, prompting the committee’s attention. The delay in obtaining UNESCO approval for the construction of a multi-purpose terminal at the Galle Port has also raised eyebrows. The project has been suspended for three years due to this delay. Other issues under scrutiny include the payment of overtime allowances to specific employees despite an excess of 914 employees within the authority. The absence of CCTV cameras covering all gates and bonded warehouses within the SLPA has also come to light. Moreover, the Night Navigation system at the Trincomalee Port is reported to be operating below its optimal capacity, which has drawn the committee’s attention. The expenditure on food for the Year 2022 amounted to a significant Rs 1.2 billion, further necessitating a comprehensive review of spending practices. Given the gravity of these findings, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority is expected to be summoned once again before COPE on 8 December 2023. This additional session will provide an opportunity for the SLPA to address the issues raised during the inquiry and take necessary corrective actions. The COPE investigations underscore the imperative of addressing irregularities and weaknesses within the SLPA to ensure transparency, efficiency, and the continued success of Sri Lanka’s vital port operations.

A case has been filed, by Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) at the Court of Appeal, regarding the failure of the authorities to act in accordance with the 4 April 2020 Appellate Court Order to mark the relevant boundaries and take steps to protect the sanctuary. The said case, highlighting illegal activities taking place at the Muthurajawela Wetlands and to prevent such unlawful activities taking place, had been considered before the Court of Appeal on 5 September. The case had been called before a Bench comprising Justices M. T. Mohammad Lafal and Vikum Kaluarachchi. At the hearing the petitioners had pointed out that the order issued to respondents by the Court in April last year to physically demarcate the boundaries of the said wetlands, has not been followed to date. They thus produced submissions to the Bench over the failure of the respondents to abide by the order issued to them which has now exceeded 12-months. The petitioners then mentioned that the Court had issued its directive to the respondents to implement its order within a 90-day period. However, the Attorney General’s Department, appearing on behalf of the respondents, informed the Court that the process of physically demarcating the boundaries of the Muthurajawela Wetlands has commenced. The Court of Appeal Bench having perused the submissions of the petitioners and the Attorney General’s Department, instructed the latter and the respondents to produce a progress report on the physically demarcating of boundaries to Court on or before 8 November and deferred further hearing of the case to the same date. Senior Counsel Ravindranath Dabare on the instructions of Attorney Samadi Hansani appeared for the petitioners. BY Methmalie Dissanayake and Mithun Jayawardhana"

The retired Air Force official’s due retirement privileges, as per his position, had been withdrawn due to him having attended a few political rallies of Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB). The Supreme Court Bench comprising Justices Yasantha Kodagoda and Arjuna Obeysekera, ordered the respondents to promptly hand over a letter to the retired Air Force officer and to his Counsel, stating that the withdrawn retirement privileges would be duly restored. The Apex Court gave this instruction to the respondents, following submissions made by Attorney General Rajaratnam, who assured the Court, that Thuyacontha’s suspended privileges for, will be duly restored. The retired Air Force officer had filed a FR petition before the Supreme Court, praying for an order to the Air Force Commander, to restore his retirement privileges, which had been suspended due to his having attended a few political meetings of the JJB. The petitioner had also moved the Court, to order the respondents to pay him compensation amounting to Rs 5 million and to deem that the actions of the Air Force Commander, had infringed his Fundamental Rights. The petitioner had also named the Administrative Director of the Sri Lanka Air Force, State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon and the Attorney General, as the respondents. He had further informed the Court, via his petition, that he had come to know of the suspension of his retirement privileges and his blacklisting by the Sri Lanka Air Force, via the media last March. But, Thuyacontha a had stated in his petition, that to date his former employer (Air Force), had failed to officially convey to him, about the withdrawal of his retirement privileges and perks. He had stated that he had diligently served the Air Force, for a period in excess of three decades, while doing his utmost towards the war and that during his long service he had also been feted with numerous honours and accolades as well. He had also emphasised that either during his active service or even in his retirement, he had never been engaged in any illegal activity. The petitioner had mentioned that in such a scenario, depriving him of his retirement privileges and proceeding to blacklist him had been questionable tactics adopted by the Sri Lanka Airforce. He had further explained to the Court, that without following the requite law concerning retired officials, the Air Force Commander, has no legal right to blacklist him, under any circumstance. Hence, the former Air Force officer, has pointed out that the Supreme Court, should deem that his Fundamental Rights have been blatantly violated by the Air Force Commander, who had blacklisted him without even seeking a response from him and to deem the actions of the Commander as null and void and to instruct him to pay him compensation of Rs 5 million over the violation of his FR. Attorneys Sunil Watagala and J. M. Wijeyabanndara, looked into the interests of the petitioner. BY Kumudu Upul Shantha"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/08/printing-fake-liquor-stickers-a-criminal-tax-offence-sajith/,Printing fake liquor stickers a criminal tax offence – Sajith,Author not found,0,2023-09-07T20:33:00+00:00," Saying that fixing of counterfeit stickers on liquor bottles should be considered an offence similar to compilation of forged documents, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa added that offenders committing such acts ought to be prosecuted according to the country’s criminal law. Speaking in Parliament yesterday (7), he stated that printing of counterfeit security stickers is a criminal tax offence.  He charged that instead of striving to prosecute those behind the racket, the Excise Department action, of only subjecting offenders to a minor fine and allowing them to go scot free, cannot be condoned especially in a country which has been rendered bankrupt economically. Speaking further, the Opposition Leader said, “There are ample stocks of liquor bottles with counterfeit stickers at the first floor of the Excise Department, situated inRajagiriya. We have proof that certain corrupt officers of this Department are presently in the process of removing the counterfeit stickers and replacing them with genuine stickers in a bid to sweep this conspiracy under the carpet. The Excise Commissioner General, during a recent radio programme, had mentioned publicly that as they have issued an invoice for illegal liquor bottles the offenders would be released after subjecting them to a settlement fine. However, we have to ask how such offenders could be freed after only imposing a settlement fine on them. Is this so simple and is this a mere minor offence. This regime, due to dwindling State coffers, is continuing to impose taxes on masses. But, they are least concerned about recouping losses, via this racket, by imposing far more stringent punishment on the offenders.” Responding to the views expressed by the Opposition Leader, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya stated that thus far those found guilty of being involved in the racket have not been freed. He added that at the same time stocks of liquor containing counterfeit stickers, seized by the Excise Department have also not been released to the domestic market thus far. The State Minister added that in the recent past the Excise Department had seized around 100,000 bottles of liquor with counterfeit stickers and of that number 43,776 had been 180 mm bottles.  Siyambalapitiya was also said that fines exceeding Rs 52 million had been imposed on offenders. Meanwhile, SJB MP Buddika Pathirana, joining the conversation, pointed out that State Minister Siyambalapitiya, on a previous occasion, had stated that the counterfeit sticker issue had been referred to the CID. He thus asked the Minister to enlighten the House on the progress of the CID investigation, but State Minister Siyambalapitiya did not respond. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

The late General Sir John Kotelawala would have been proud of General Peiris, who groomed his students to dress impeccably, converse in English, dine comfortably with the fork and knife, and learn to dance Cuban rumba, Afro-Brazilian samba, Argentinian Brazilian tango and cha cha cha. More than that, he trained them to think wisely and serve unambiguously Sri Lanka and humanity. Anyone walking into General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) or University Hospital KDU will witness General Peiris’s outstanding contribution to both military service and higher education in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan leaders recognised him as a leader with an indomitable spirit and a far-reaching vision. An all-rounder, General Peiris excelled wherever he served and whatever he did! He served in many battlefield appointments including as the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 22 Division in charge of Trincomalee District at the height of the war. Severely injured in battle to liberate Kilinochchi (Sathjaya 3), he never gave up. Committed to human rights, he understood the importance of adhering to international norms and the value of international engagement. Although he reached the appointment of Chief of Army Staff, I wish he became the Army Commander. Unlike many, he was well-read and understood the need to transform the Army into a modern military. With the physical battlespace shifting to the information space, he had the understanding to raise cyber warriors to monitor and rebut online falsehoods and manipulations. However, as Vice Chancellor, Gen. Peiris mentored a generation of scholar-warriors to create that Revolution in Military Affairs that others still lack the understanding to raise to secure Sri Lanka. A man of the calibre of Gen. Peiris was not built overnight. He served in several appointments including as Defence Attache of the Sri Lankan Embassy in the US when the FBI dismantled the LTTE international network on US soil subsequently led to the crucial intelligence needed to sink the LTTE fleet of ships plying between North Korea and Sri Lanka. His steadfast service to Sri Lanka especially his contribution to ending the campaign of terror in Sri Lanka did not end in May 2009. He built an institution that will raise the men and women who will serve the branches of government to protect the nation. I had the pleasure of working with Gen. Peiris when he was a member of the Advisory Council of the Institute of National Security Studies and also as a member of the Board of Management of the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies. I also supervised KDU’s first ‘PhD student’ Admiral Jayanath Colombage, a former Navy Commander, who later became Foreign Secretary. Of all the Vice Chancellors I met in Sri Lanka, Gen. Peiris stood out as the Best Vice Chancellor in the contemporary history of Sri Lanka. He did not permit ragging, strikes, or defacing the walls with posters or buildings with graffiti. He maintained discipline, inculcated the spirit of collective leadership, and trained university students to maintain the highest standards that the State Universities were unable to achieve. He took over KDU two years after KDA became a University but it was his vision that transformed the Academy into a fully-fledged University. As Vice Chancellor of General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University from December 2008 to February 2016 and once again from 16 January 2020 until 1 September 2023, he established the foundation that will build the next generation of national security leaders of Sri Lanka. As we need to staff the national security establishments with the nation’s best and the brightest, I admire his commitment and dedication.  He opened up new horizons to the students of KDU by establishing two new facilities; the Faculty of Criminal Justice and the Faculty of Technology. During his tenure, KDU ranked 4th among the 10 Most Prestigious Academies in the World. The other top academies are the United States Military Academy at West Point, PLA National Defence University, China and the Royal Air Force College, USA. As the former Director General of the Institute of National Security Studies of Sri Lanka, may I express my gratitude to this great son of Sri Lanka for raising a generation of warfighters and peacemakers in Sri Lanka and beyond. With such expertise and experience, Gen. Peiris has much more to offer to Sri Lanka and the rest of the world.  In recognition of his steadfast contribution to higher education, may I propose General Peiris be appointed as Vice Chancellor Emeritus of KDU.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

She indicated that she intends to initiate preliminary discussions with various relevant institutions, including the Police, local authorities and the National Child Protection Authority, to combat this issue effectively. This topic was extensively deliberated upon during a recent meeting of the Ministerial Consultative Committee (MCC) on Women’s, Children’s Affairs and Social Empowerment, which was chaired by Kumarasinghe along with MP Anupa Pasqual. During the discussions, it was revealed that the exploitation of children and women for begging has evolved into a profitable business. It has become common practice to hire children for begging purposes, with some being coerced into drug use, while women feign pregnancy to elicit sympathy and contributions. Despite the existence of legal provisions addressing this matter, concerns were raised about the lack of effective implementation at the practical level. Kumarasinghe instructed officials to take immediate action to gather pertinent data regarding beggars in the country, which will be obtained through a survey conducted by the Department of Social Services in September.

Rangebandara emphasised the close connection between the UNP and the country’s development, highlighting the party’s longstanding commitment to the progress of Sri Lanka.

Addressing a media conference held at the Opposition Leader’s Office recently, the MP stated that the entire racket of printing counterfeit stickers and placing them on liquor bottles and then releasing such stocks to the local market is done intentionally and with the blessings of big wigs of the Excise Department. He termed it as a deliberate crime. He therefore pointed out that instead of taking stringent action to prosecute offenders, as per the Provisions of the Penal Code, subjecting offenders to only ordinary fines as per the Excise Act, could best be described as measures adopted by the Excise Commissioner General to protect wrongdoers. Speaking further, the MP stated, “This racket is akin to printing of forged currency. Printing counterfeit stickers also falls under the crime of compilation of forged documents. In such an event if such offences are only described as technical offences, we feel the Excise Commissioner General is safeguarding a set of corrupt officials and he is striving to sweep this racket under the carpet. We also suspect that the Commissioner General could also be receiving kickbacks in return from liquor firms involved in this racket. If the Commissioner General is failing to prosecute corrupt officers who are in the Department, then it has to be said clearly that he too is a part of this corrupt and sinister system.” The MP added that the attention drawn towards the said racket by the Parliament Committee on Ways and Means (PCWM), helmed by MP Patali Ranawaka has also been timely. The lawmaker noted that following him having shed light on the sordid racket for years the PCWM taking action to address the issue has been commendable and would go a long way towards rooting out such malpractices for once and for all."

He made this statement in response to Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa’s allegation that the Government plans to impose a 30 per cent tax on EPF holders who choose not to participate in the debt optimisation process. President Wickremesinghe said, “We will tax the primary bond dealers through the next budget, and you will find surprises in the budget.” He also expressed his disapproval of Opposition Leader Premadasa’s criticism of companies that invest in bonds, suggesting that seeking funds from these companies for various purposes is inconsistent with his stance. Additionally, President Wickremesinghe clarified that the proposal to impose a 30 per cent tax on EPF was initially put forward by the SLPP even before he became Prime Minister. He referenced the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill, highlighting that the Court found no issues with it. Further, he pointed out that the banks’ inability to participate in the domestic debt optimisation process was emphasised in the Supreme Court’s determination due to their limited capital reserves. In response to Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance (COPF), Harsha de Silva’s request to debate the Inland Revenue Amendment Bill, which includes provisions for the 30 per cent tax on EPF, President Wickremesinghe made these statements. A tense situation arose in Parliament when Opposition MPs protested the decision to debate the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill before it had been examined by the Parliamentary Committee on Public Finance. Dr. de Silva addressed the issue, stating that the COPF had not yet discussed the Inland Revenue Amendment Bill. He emphasised that the Finance Committee had not conducted any analysis of the Bill and raised concerns that this move might sideline the State Finance Committee within Parliament. The COPF Chair disclosed that he had requested information about the bill from the Finance Secretary, but as of yesterday (6), he had not received the necessary data. He questioned how a thorough analysis of the bill could be conducted without access to this essential information. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

Fielding questions during a media briefing at the Archbishops House, Colombo, Cardinal Ranjith yesterday (6) said the probe should be in accordance with international laws and standards to ensure that it is carried out in a transparent, independent manner sans political interference. “We wish to urge our fellow citizens to focus their attention on the facts that have been presented through the programme as our concern is not to find fault with the Channel on or its past relations with the country,” he said noting that it was the Channel’s findings that were important to Sri Lanka’s Catholic Church. Cardinal Ranjith said Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said a Parliamentary Select Committee would be appointed to look into matters that had been revealed in the programme on the Easter Sunday attacks. “We wish to note that even though Parliamentary Select Committees and a Presidential Committee of Inquiry as well as other committees were appointed in the past to investigate these sad events and many recommendations were made by those commissions, no credible and positive action was taken by political authorities on the recommendations. He accused the present and the previous government of only paying lip service to the recommendations. Even the recommendations which were implemented such as the banning of several extremist organisations such as the National Thowheeth Jama’ath had been lifted recently,” he said.   The Head of Sri Lanka’s Catholic Church said therefore no tangible and credible results would emerge from yet another Parliamentary Select Committee. Instead, it would be a waste of public funds and time. According to the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka, investigations should be carried out on the findings outlined in the various commission reports already presented. And recommendations stated there need to be implemented, he said. Cardinal Ranjith said investigations should be made by an independent international investigation team assisted by Sri Lankan officials of the CID whose services were originally sought by the Government and transferred to other areas and posts by biased political authorities. He said to ensure that the fresh investigation will be independent of officials in the Police and the intelligence being investigated following the Easter Attacks and hold positions at present should be suspended or moved out of their present high posts to ensure the independence of the investigation. Cardinal Ranjith urged President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Government to carry out these requests. “We do not feel that truth and justice will be meted to the innocent victims of the 2019 Easter Attacks, unless an absolutely independent, transparent and sincere internationally monitored investigation probe was carried out,” Cardinal Ranjith stressed noting that the Catholic Church did not believe in mere promises but in action.

Speaking in Parliament yesterday (6), Premadasa said the Government decision to appoint another Select Committee to investigate the Easter attacks appears to be an insincere gesture. Premadasa alleged that the Government came to power by exploiting racial tensions and undermining national unity while promising justice for the Easter attack victims. He said the Government has failed to reveal the complete truth about the Easter attacks and has not conducted a fair, impartial, and transparent investigation. He said the international community has also expressed doubts about the investigation. When Cardinal Ranjith raised concerns, the Opposition leader pointed out that the response was inadequate, suggesting the need for a transparent investigation and the possibility of appointing a Select Committee, which he saw as an evasive tactic. Premadasa said the need for an impartial and fair investigation within the country, especially considering the loss of many lives in the barbaric Easter attack. He said the majority believe that there has not been a fair local investigation into this terrorist attack. He stressed the importance of justice for the victims and their families. Premadasa lamented the racist attacks that followed the Easter attack, targeting the Muslim community. He criticised individuals who promoted racism and division and gained ministerial positions by exploiting national unity. He claimed that these individuals have failed to identify the masterminds behind the attack and suggested that the Government lacks the resolve to uncover the truth. Furthermore, he called for an international investigation and proposed that fair investigations could be conducted with both local and international cooperation under a united government committed to justice and transparency.

Apart from Namal Rajapaksa, none of his family members has spoken about the controversy so far. Speaking in Parliament, Rajapaksa stressed that Channel 4 has harboured a long-standing rivalry with the Rajapaksas, dating back to the conclusion of the war in 2009. He questioned the credibility of the video, pointing out that it was subsequently deleted from the channel’s website. Rajapaksa expressed his concerns that the latest video from Channel 4 may be another attempt to settle scores with the Rajapaksas for their role in eliminating terrorism from Sri Lanka or to serve certain political agendas. He stressed, “Channel 4 has a historical animosity towards my family, my father, and the Rajapaksa name, particularly following the conclusion of the war in 2009. They have consistently released videos targeting the Rajapaksas. In my view, Channel 4 appears to function more as a video production entity than a genuine media institution.” Speaking further, Rajapaksa said it is important not to exploit the tragic events of the Easter Sunday attacks for political purposes. “Investigations are still underway into the tragedy. These things could hinder those investigations,” he said. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

It is really disturbing that such a media outlet operating in Europe has published such untrue news to confuse and mislead people without investigating the truth properly.” Azad Maulana, who had been engaged in office-related activities with us during my tenure as Chief Minister, left the country approximately a year and a half ago due to significant conflicts in his personal life, the State Minister insisted. He also said it is usual for people who make asylum claims in foreign countries to criticise us (MPs/rulers) and political parties to confirm their asylum claims. However, due to his (Maulana’s) association with me, he went a few miles ahead and got his asylum claim confirmed by portraying himself in the news, he added. “I have personally witnessed on numerous occasions the presence of deceit and treachery in the paths I have traversed. The central theme of the video falsely portrays the Easter bombings as a strategy for regime change. This is entirely untrue, and even individuals with a basic understanding of politics can readily discern the facts.” “The Easter bombings occurred on 21 April 2019. However, it is important to note that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) had already secured a resounding victory in the Local Government Elections in early 2018, maintaining a strong majority. It is evident, even to the layperson, that there would have been no reason to launch such an attack under such circumstances, because the party was in a very strong position when they faced the Presidential Election.” Also, the Easter bombings carried out in Sri Lanka are very cruel, so we are sure that all those involved should be given the maximum punishment of death. Therefore, it can be observed that Hanzeer Azad Maulana himself has expressed his views as if he was directly connected with the incident. Therefore, he should also be investigated and the culprits, whoever they may be, should be severely punished in accordance with the law, he asserted. He stressed that there is no doubt that the Easter bombings will be shocking to those who are not aware of the brutal global attacks carried out by Islamist fundamentalist terrorists. “We also have strong suspicions that this is an attempt to get the real criminals to escape under the organised agenda of Islamist extremists ISIS, which is run by more intellectuals and the wealthy.” In addition, Channel 4 has been informed that the military intelligence officer Suresh Sallay, who is mainly associated with this story, was not in Sri Lanka during the timeframe mentioned by Maulana. He was abroad, and he was not working on military duty of Sri Lanka since January 2018 until the attack took place, he added."

In a surprising move, the SLFP removed MP Jayasekara, who was the party’s General Secretary and replaced him with Sarath Ekanayake as the Acting General Secretary. In a letter dated 5 September sent by the SLFP Chairman, it was stated that Jayasekera’s party membership has been suspended, and a disciplinary inquiry will be conducted in accordance with the party’s constitution. Additionally, a charge sheet will be issued within the next 14 days. This decision was made during a meeting held at Sirisena’s residence. Responding to the media about Jayasekara’s suspension, Sirisena, who was seemingly in a light mood, said, “We did not kick Jayasekara out of the Party. This is only a temporary move. I have a Court case with regard to my party chairmanship. So, I do not wish to reveal more details at this moment.” Sirisena said there is no issue with Jayasekara continuing his party membership. However, Jayasekara won’t be given the General Secretary post. “He can have any other post, but not the General Secretary post,” Sirisena added. “The decision to suspend Jayasekara’s party membership was taken because of certain actions of him. If he likes to compromise and reach an agreement, then there would be no problems with having Jayasekara in the party,” he said. When reminded that Jayasekara was the right hand of Sirisena in the Party, the latter said in politics anything could happen. “This is politics. All the members of Bandaranaike family were removed from the Party as well. These things happen,” he further said. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

Addressing the media at a press conference, Jayasekara said he did his best to put the Party back on its feet since he was given the General Secretary post in 2019. Jayasekara said the Party’s decision was not the sentiment felt at the grassroots. “Most of the membership do not want to be a part of the Government. It is a handful people at the top who want to remove me because they want to plug this party to the UNP”, he added. The ousted General Secretary said he was taken aback when he received the email regarding his ouster on 5 September night. Speaking further, Jayasekara said there was a spilt within the party about being a part of the Government. Several MPs joined the Government and received ministerial portfolios. I always acted against it. “If the party wants to act according to their wishes and kick me out, I have nothing to say about it” he said. Dayasiri said the move made by party Chairman Maithripala Sirisena was not a surprise because the latter has taken similar courses of action in the past as well. “This is a completely wrong decision because many Central Committee members including myself were not invited to the meeting on the night of 5 September. I will take necessary action about it,” he added. Moreover, Jayasekara said Sirisena should not entertain fears about the leadership because he said, “I never bite the hand that fed me”. However, Sirisena must realise about those who really intend to harm him, he added. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

Addressing a media briefing, JJB MP Vijitha Herath emphasised the absurdity of conducting an inquiry while Suresh Salley, who faces allegations, continues to hold the position of SIS Director. “As claimed by Azad Maulana in the Channel 4 video, it is evident that former Eastern Province Chief Minister P Chandrakanthan and Suresh Salley had direct connections with the perpetrators of the Easter Sunday bombings. Incriminating photographs featuring Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Maulana, and Pillaiyan have surfaced. Maulana himself has disclosed his association with Pillaiyan. The actual culprits behind the attacks remain at large due to the misdirection of investigations. These revelations unveil the masterminds and true motives behind the attacks,” Herath alleged. The MP further pointed out that Salley, who faced accusations related to the attacks, was appointed as the Director of the SIS by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa shortly after assuming office. This raises questions about potential connections between Salley’s appointment and the Easter attacks. Herath also stressed the need to resume investigations against Gotabaya Rajapaksa now that he is no longer the President, as he no longer enjoys immunity from legal proceedings.

Since Xi became China’s Leader, he has attended every other G20 Summit. Some commentators see the move as a deliberate snub; Beijing has long-standing border tensions with New Delhi that escalated into a brief but deadly clash in 2020. India’s membership in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue alongside Australia, Japan, and the United States has also angered China. Yet these issues aren’t new, which makes Xi’s absence a little more puzzling. At the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, last month, Xi and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seemed to get along relatively well. In a private meeting, the two leaders nominally agreed to reduce border tensions. Xi may be irritated with India for lobbying against China’s influence within BRICS as it plans to add six new members. Foreign Policy’s China Brief said the tensions may also be related to cartography. After the summit, China’s Ministry of Natural Resources released a new official map that—as usual—included other countries’ territory as part of China, including the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China briefly invaded in 1962 and claims as part of southern Tibet.

Several years ago, the Mathugama PS collected electronic waste, including mobile phone batteries, tube lights, television tubes, and other electronic items, from its suburbs for recycling. However, instead of proper recycling, these hazardous materials, which should not be released into the environment, were illegally dumped at the old Horawala school site, the residents alleged. It is reported that on the request of the Mathugama Divisional Secretary, the sacks containing electronic waste were buried in the Welipenna Holinbone Colony Cemetery. Subsequently, when residents protested against the dumping of waste in the cemetery, citing health concerns, the electronic waste was moved to the Athulathmudaligama waste yard. Recently, due to objections raised by PS Councillor Athula Maddumage, this waste was transferred to the local council’s solid waste collection facility, situated in a densely populated area near C.W.W. Kannangara College, Mathugama. Former PS member Maddumage commented on this incident, expressing concern that the waste contains hazardous materials such as mercury, cyanide, heavy metals, and carcinogenic substances that pose both short-term and long-term health risks to the community. He urged the PS authorities to responsibly recycle this waste. The protesters strongly criticised the Mathugama Local Council for dumping toxic waste in an area where schoolchildren and residents rely on the same water sources for drinking. He called on the local council authorities, as well as government health and environmental agencies, to promptly recycle or dispose of this toxic electronic waste stock safely and responsibly.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Weerasinghe said that they have already proposed a national policy for agriculture, to regulate the use, quality and price of chemical fertiliser and seeds imported to the country, based on experimental data carried out over several decades. He also mentioned that it has been confirmed that the highest rice yield per hectare can be obtained by using 70% chemical fertiliser and 30% organic fertiliser in proportion, based on research conducted since 2003 and the proposed national policy will also include those findings. Weerasinghe conveyed these updates during a media briefing held yesterday (5) at the Presidential Media Centre. “Even though governments have changed, every sector needs to have a national policy that does not change. The agriculture sector has been waiting for a national policy for the last 25 years. If we lose the quality of the agricultural sector, the country’s agriculture will fail. Therefore, this country needs a national policy regarding imported chemical fertiliser and seeds together with their price regulation,” he said. In the next sectoral oversight committee meeting, a report will be submitted to investigate the quality of chemical fertiliser and seeds and to regulate their prices. “Under the direct advice of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, we are in the process of introducing modern technology to traditional agriculture. Also, measures are being taken to provide training to agriculture-related government officials regarding the use of fertiliser.” The MP said that due to the overuse of chemical fertiliser for many decades, the quality of the soil has now decreased. It has been recommended to apply 70% chemical fertiliser and 30% organic fertiliser for crops in proportion. However, there is a problem regarding the quality of these applied fertilisers. Some companies produce high-quality fertiliser in the country. However, due to the recent issues related to fertiliser, their image has suffered some damage. It should be rectified again. Programmes should be prepared to protect such entrepreneurs and promote agriculturearound the country. Entrepreneurs who produce organic bio-fertiliser and liquid fertiliser should be gathered and this programme should be carried forward. This cannot be done overnight. It is necessary to provide organic fertiliser to the farmers for at least five seasons to make this programme successful, he said. Through the Colombo Declaration, signed under the United Nations Global Environment Programme in 2016, we have agreed that the nitrogen waste released into the environment should be reduced by 50% by 2030. Therefore, the implementation of this programme is mandatory. “Also, the European Union has decided to make their purchases of completely organic fruits and vegetables when exporting to their countries by 2030. So, if we hope to export fruits and vegetables to EU countries in the future, we should tend to use organic fertiliser. That is why it was decided, as a committee, to continue the agricultural production process with organic fertiliser. In 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture recommended the use of organic fertiliser. They have asked to apply 10 metric tons per hectare. However, the farmers are facing practical problems. Ten thousand kilos cannot be applied per hectare of land. But today, government and private institutions have researched together and produced bio and liquid fertiliser,” he said. It is possible to increase the yield by 40% through the use of nano-fertiliser, compared to100% chemical fertiliser. Also, 70% organic fertiliser and 30% chemical fertiliser can increase the yield of this country from 13% to 25%, he added Speaking further, Weerasinghe said that there is a very wrong attitude among farmers regarding organic fertiliser. Therefore, there should be a change in the attitude of the farmers as well. Chemical fertiliser companies are ahead of us and they have drawn it. Therefore, the time has come to create a new attitude change among the farmers, he added. “The agriculture modernisation programme is essential for this country. Organic fertiliser should be used for the safety of seeds, health and soil. If not, the degradation of our soil is inevitable. People’s health, seeds and the whole agriculture sector would be destroyed. Before the use of chemical fertiliser in 1960, this country was self-sufficient in agriculture. Everyone has to think again about what happened to this Eastern Granary. Also, the government spends a lot of money to import chemical fertiliser. Many people are still protesting against this programme. As a young MP who came to theParliament through the vote of the farmers, I will fulfil my responsibility to the country even if I lose my political career,” he asserted."

He said the Committee on Risk and Safety of Medicines had recommended  the drug to be sent for testing to a WHO approved lab facility at the beginning of August, when the issue regarding the particular antibiotic came up. Kumudesh accused health authorities of having failed to take action even after suspicions regarding the antibiotic were further heightened when a 50-year-old patient, being treated at the National Hospital, Colombo died after being administered the particular antibiotic. It cannot be claimed that the deaths were caused by the drug itself as a fair laboratory test was not conducted due to the lack of equipment in the National Drug Quality Control Laboratory (NDQCL). But it is a serious situation for the NMRA to deliberately delay conducting tests, at the WHO approved lab facility, owing to the seriousness of the issue regarding the quality of medicinal drugs- especially since the relevant pharmaceutical company was willing to fund and support any laboratory test that was conducted with regard to the said medicinal drug, he said.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Speaking in Parliament yesterday (5), the Opposition Leader said he could understand the Cardinal’s stance, rooted in the pain caused by the Easter Sunday terror attacks of 2019, which still lingers within the Catholic community in the country. Premadasa alleged that the Easter attack had been utilised as a political tool to gain power. He pointed out that during election campaigns in 2019 and 2020, this tragic event was discussed. However, he lamented that justice has not yet been fully served and as such, it is inappropriate to insult Cardinal Ranjith and the Catholic community without conducting a formal investigation. Premadasa stressed the necessity for an international-level probe into the Channel 4 disclosure regarding the Easter Sunday attacks. He criticised the Government for not providing its own disclosure on the matter and called for an impartial international investigation to ascertain the truth. He also mentioned that a Minister had made an insulting statement suggesting that Cardinal Ranjith could have been involved in the attacks. Premadasa condemned this statement and highlighted that the Minister’s remarks, regarding the Cardinal, were offensive. Premadasa further said that during the presidential election, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected in the belief that the majority, including the Cardinal at that time, would ensure national security. However, he underscored that now, through foreign efforts, a significant revelation has emerged concerning the masterminds behind the Easter attacks. Consequently, Premadasa expressed disappointment that the search for these individuals within the country seems futile, necessitating an international investigation. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

The statement said UN Sri Lanka has taken notice of an alarming surge in fraudulent activities, falsely claiming association with the UN and its officials. These scams, which have been detected in various forms such as email, Internet websites, text messages, regular mail, or facsimile, aim to deceive recipients into providing financial support or personal information. The UN unequivocally states that these activities are fraudulent and should be treated with the utmost scepticism. The UN is particularly concerned about the prevalence of these scams in Sri Lanka and wishes to alert the Sri Lankan public about these fraudulent activities, which are being perpetrated in the name of the organisation or its officials through various fraudulent schemes. “The UN reiterates that it does not charge any fees at any stage of its recruitment process, including application, interviews, processing, and training. Job seekers are encouraged to visit the official UN careers website at careers.un.org (https://careers.un.org) to apply for positions. Any request for money or personal banking information in the recruitment process is fraudulent. The UN also emphasises that it does not charge any fees during its procurement process, including supplier registration and bid submissions. Businesses looking to engage with the UN can find information on opportunities through the UN Procurement Division (https://www.ungm.org/Public/Notice). The UN categorically states that it does not request any information related to bank accounts or other private details. Any such request should be considered a scam. The UN does not offer prizes, awards, funds, certificates, ATM cards, compensation for internet fraud, scholarships, or conduct lotteries. Claims of such offers should be treated as fraudulent. The UN does not approve military vacations or pensions or release packages in exchange for a fee. Any request for payments related to these services is not legitimate,” the statement said. Therefore, UN Sri Lanka urged the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious correspondence or activities claiming association with the organisation. To report scams or seek clarification, individuals are encouraged to contact their local authorities and visit the official United Nations website for accurate information and updates. “Anyone with doubts about the authenticity of a message purportedly from, for, or on behalf of the United Nations Sri Lanka or its officials, is encouraged to send an e-mail to [email protected],” the statement added."

The SIS Chief made this remark, when a case filed by him against Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini, in connection with comments made by Sallley, related to views expressed by the Priest concerned, at a zoom discussion with the International Justice Collective, on 23 October 2021, on behalf of the victims of the Easter Sunday carnage, was taken up for hearing. Salley giving evidence stated that Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini of St. Anthony’s Church, in Negombo, during that zoom discussion, had made remarks critical and harmful to him.  He insisted that he had received unwarranted publicity both locally and overseas, due to the conduct of the Priest concerned. The SIS Chief giving evidence, also maintained that the actions of Rev. Fr. Gamini, had ruined his public image and it had also embarrassed and humiliated him and his family too. Salley further informed Judge Vithana, that he has thus far put in a service exceeding three and a half decades and stressed that the Priest’s remarks, had placed both his and family’s life in serious danger while dealing a serious blow to his professional life. He then noted that making of such controversial comments, when a case is being heard in Court, in this regard, could also provide a warped image of the incident in question, to the society. The witness added that out of four members of his family, three of them had served with the Sri Lanka Army and that some of them had even been disabled, while serving this country. He also emphasised that the comments reportedly made by Rev. Fr. Gamini, mentioning his name, had been so vicious, vituperative and virulent, that he had been forceds to withdraw his child from school. Attorney Sahan Weerasinghe appeared for the Salley, while Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini was represented by PC Shamil Perera and Attorney-at-Law Wimal Ratwatta. Later, plaintiff Suresh Salley submitted an affidavit to the Court, to substantiate his evidence. Taking the submissions into consideration, the Judge, fixed further hearing of evidence to 25 January next year. The plaintiff has also prayed the said Court, to issue an order to the Priest concerned, to pay him compensation amounting to Rs 50 million, over the loss of reputation caused to him, by the resultant actions of Rev. Fr. Gamini. BY Hansi Nanayakkara"

He mentioned that a new sticker system had been introduced, by the Excise Department, as a way to counter the dwindling revenue from the liquor trade, but he observed that certain people involved in the counterfeit sticker racket had managed to make a killing off the illegal business.  Siyambalapitiya made these observations addressing the media, following an event held at Ruwanwella yesterday. The State Minister was of the view that in comparison to the previous time, the bottles of liquor carrying counterfeit stickers, that had been seized during this week, had decreased. He added that therefore the raids currently being conducted by Excise officers in this regard had been successful. Siyambalapitiya added that with the introduction of the new sticker system the domestic liquor production had spiked by 11 per cent while the profits had increased by 20 to 21 per cent. However, he was quick to point out that the counterfeit sticker racket had contributed to profit decreasing. He noted that the raids to seize bottles of liquor containing counterfeit stickers will be expedited further throughout the country and assured that no leeway will be left for racketeers to continue with their rackets. The State Minister warned that those found guilty being involved in the said racket will be fined Rs 500,000 and that all efforts will be made to recoup the losses incurred via the racket. He added that those engaged in the racket will also be prosecuted and their licenses cancelled.  By Mithun Jayawardhana"

The decision to postpone the Convention was unanimously agreed upon during a meeting of the UNP’s Working Committee, chaired by Party Leader and President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, at Sirikotha. Rangebandara explained that the new date for the UNP’s working committee meeting, chaired by President Wickremesinghe, will be determined in October. He emphasised that this decision was made to avoid inconveniencing the participants. He further stated that although every effort had been made to prepare for the convention on the originally scheduled date, the persistent inclement weather conditions made it necessary to postpone it indefinitely. According to Rangebandara, President Wickremesinghe had directed them to hold a minimum of 70 regional-level working committee meetings before the convention. To date, a total of 153 such meetings have been successfully conducted. Regarding the stance of Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, Rangebandara noted that it is evident that he will not be running in the upcoming Presidential Election. He also mentioned previous instances where the Opposition Leader stepped aside, causing divisions within the party when selecting its leader. Such incidents have occurred throughout the political history of the Premier, according to Rangebandara. BY Naalir Jamaldeen"

Advanced Level Examination 2023. The A/L examination will be held from 27 November to 21 December as scheduled, Premajayantha said. According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Education, a total of 323,913 applications have already been received for the examination. The Education Ministry provided an explanation for the November schedule, citing a significant delay in the past, due to teachers and lecturers not completing paper marking in a timely manner, resulting in delayed exam results. It was emphasised that altering the proposed exam schedule again would be unfair to the majority of students. The Ministry further noted that, based on collected statistics, the majority of schools have successfully covered the Advanced Level syllabus. Additionally, the Ministry announced that students who wish to re-sit the exams for the second or third time, following the release of A/L examination results, will be allowed to do so by following the prescribed procedure at the Department of Examinations.

Dissanayake, while addressing a gathering in Kotte, highlighted the critical importance of grassroots support for the JJB’s success. He pointed out, “Throughout our country’s history, there have been many divisions, but now, a new division has emerged in society. It’s a division between those who agree with us and those who do not. People who support both, the Rajapaksas and Wickremesinghe are now in the same camp. There is a growing people’s movement against the corruption of the elite class in this country.” Dissanayake further stated that with the rise of this common people’s movement, certain groups have initiated smear campaigns against it. He remarked, “They can continue with these campaigns, but they must also remember that the power of the people surpasses them. People like Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksa lived with great authority, but eventually, they had to yield to the power of the people. The people are the sole source of power for the JJB.” BY Anuradha Herath"

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer.

The Rotary Club of Trincomalee warmly welcomed the cyclists participating in this event, which is organised by the CCC Foundation in collaboration with Rotary Clubs. The primary objective of this island-wide bike ride is to promote the importance of the Telephone Line ‘1333’, a lifeline for individuals struggling with suicidal thoughts. It is a sobering fact that, on average, eleven people in Sri Lanka lose their lives to suicide every day, and for every one person who tragically succeeds, there are ten others who survive the attempt.  The mission of CCC Line 1333 is to combat this alarming trend by focusing on education, engagement, and empowerment. Through these efforts, they hope to eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health issues and other contributing social factors that can lead to suicide. CCC Line 1333 operates as a confidential and toll-free telephone counselling service, encouraging individuals to open up about their personal challenges, whether related to relationships, family, school, work, mental health, or suicidal thoughts. Currently, this service handles an average of 2,000 calls each month, offering support to people across Sri Lanka. The central aim of the ‘1333 Bikeathon Out of the Shadows’ is to spread awareness about the toll-free 1333 hotline within communities throughout Sri Lanka. In the evening, participants engaged with the public at Trinco Beach, distributing informative leaflets on suicide prevention. BY Hasfar A. Haleem"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/04/over-half-of-lankan-population-multidimensionally-vulnerable/,Over half of Lankan population : ‘multidimensionally vulnerable’,Author not found,0,2023-09-03T20:36:00+00:00,"The crushing economic crisis in Sri Lanka last year has left more than half of the island’s population “multidimensionally vulnerable”, according to a ‘national citizen’ survey led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The study spanning the years 2022 and 2023 and covering 25,000 households across the country, found 55.7 per cent of the population to be vulnerable across three dimensions — education, health and disaster, living standards — and 12 indicators, including school attendance, physical condition [of health], unemployment and indebtedness. In effect, the survey showed that 12.34 million people out of Sri Lanka’s 22.16 million-strong population have been badly affected by the crisis and remain vulnerable amid claims of a “recovering” economy. The findings are in line with earlier research by UN agencies on food insecurity levels and reaffirm anecdotal accounts of poor families cutting down their food intake and pulling their children out of school to cope with the high living costs. The findings of UNDP’s study carried out in partnership with the ‘Citra Social Innovation Lab’ anchored at the Prime Minister’s Office, assume significance, especially after the Government rejected a UNICEF report that pointed to high malnutrition levels among Sri Lankan children last year. Notably, the recently launched UNDP report said a majority, or 82 per cent, of those found to be “multidimensionally vulnerable” lived in rural Sri Lanka. It underscored the need for “more policy focus” in those areas. Further, the study found a third of the country’s population gets into debt for essential needs like food, medical care, education, and pawning jewellery or selling items.  “Several districts, including Ampara, Batticaloa, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Nuwara Eliya, Puttalam, and Vavuniya, exhibit notable multidimensional vulnerability values, with over 65 per cent of their populations identified as vulnerable,” the report said, indicating that people living in the island’s Tamil-majority North and East, impacted by the war, and the economically-marginalised Malaiyaha Tamil community, are among those facing the highest levels of economic deprivation. Capital Colombo and the neighbouring Gampaha districts emerged as regions with the highest concentration of vulnerable individuals, a trend that the study attributed to their substantial population sizes. Last year’s financial meltdown pushed Sri Lanka to bankruptcy and brought its citizens to the streets as they contended with acute shortages, long power cuts, and a dramatic increase in prices. A year after defaulting on its foreign debt in the wake of a stifling balance of payments problem, the Government obtained International Monetary Fund (IMF) support in March 2023 by way of a USD 3 billion package to be disbursed over four years. While President Ranil Wickremesinghe has pledged to set the country’s economy on a path of recovery, his Government is struggling to reach an agreement with its external creditors. Colombo must finalise a debt treatment plan before the IMF’s scheduled review this month, as the second tranche of the IMF loan is contingent on it. Further, the Government recently announced its decision to restructure its domestic debt, mainly by recasting the outgo on the country’s pension funds. Worker unions have been fiercely opposing the move. In a recent letter to the IMF, more than 80 Sri Lankan organisations and trade unions said subjecting workers’ pension funds to domestic debt restructuring “will diminish the returns to wage-earners and deplete the fund to half its current value.” “Your debt restructuring programme is crippling working people in Sri Lanka who run our economy and create value in our society. The economic reforms you have imposed on us, without reflecting on the negative consequences of the previous reforms enacted over 16 IMF interventions, are crushing our economy,” they told the Fund. Meanwhile, Central Bank data showed a further slowdown in headline inflation in August, dropping to 4 per cent from 6.3 per cent recorded last month. Still, the numbers are yet to translate to relief for most citizens, especially because of last year’s exceptionally high base effect, even as incomes have remained stagnant.   The Government — in adherence to the IMF programme — recently began making cash transfers to 1.5 million families out of the 2 million it has identified as poor and eligible. Many more families are protesting, asking to be included on the list. However, women’s groups and Government critics argue that a targeted social security programme, amounting to 0.6 per cent of the GDP, will prove grossly inadequate to combat the severe economic strain many face.  (The Hindu)"

Senior Scientist of the Landslides Early Warning Centre, Dr. Wasantha Senadeera, said Galle, Kalutara, Ratnapura, and Kegalle are among the affected districts. He further said Level One ‘Yellow Watch’ landslide early warning alerts have been issued to Baddegama, Elpitiya, and Nagoda DS divisions, along with the surrounding areas in the Galle District. In the Kalutara District, alerts have been issued for Bulathsinhala, Ingiriya, Mathugama, and Walallawita DS divisions and their surrounding areas. In the Kegalle District, the warnings cover Ruwanwella, Yatiyanthota, Deraniyagala, Bulathkohupitiya, and Dehiowita DS divisions. Lastly, in the Ratnapura District, alerts have been issued for Eheliyagoda, Kuruwita, and Ratnapura DS divisions. Dr. Senadeera added that residents in hilly areas experiencing heavy rainfall have been advised to remain vigilant. They should be alert to signs such as slanting trees, leaning light and telephone posts, sudden muddy water emerging from highland springs, cracks in walls and floors of buildings. In such cases, they have been urged to move promptly to safe locations after informing the Police and Disaster Management Centre (DMC) officials. The inclement weather has caused flooding on many main roads and low-lying areas of the Colombo metropolitan city. In several locations, branches have fallen onto the roads, causing traffic congestion. The water levels of the Gin Ganga, Kalu Ganga, and Nilwala Ganga rivers continue to rise. Residents in low-lying areas near these rivers have been cautioned to relocate to safer areas if water levels continue to increase. The water level of the Nilwala Ganga had reached 5.8 metres by noon yesterday (3). The Meteorological Department has predicted the possibility of showers or thundershowers in the Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Western, Central, and North-Western Provinces today (4). Regarding the current atmospheric conditions, the Duty Meteorologist forecast fairly heavy showers exceeding 50 mm in some places in the Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces, as well as in the Galle, Matara, and Nuwara Eliya Districts during the daytime. Strong gusty winds ranging from 40 to 50 kmph could occur intermittently in the Western slopes of the Central Hill, as well as in the Western, North-Western, Northern, and Eastern provinces.

He noted that even though Sri Lanka is a divided country, with politicians who often hold strong differences, similar to India, no leader in Sri Lanka, while in Office, would intentionally take actions that pose a threat to India “knowingly”. He said the surveillance ship Yuan Wang 5 that came last year was a missile tracking vessel and not a warship. But, with today’s technology, it can be a missile tracking vessel as well as track a weather satellite. Indians’ perspective was this ship could be used for either purpose, he asserted. He said, last year, Sri Lanka approved it as a research vessel. “They thought it is a tracking vessel that is used for more benign purposes. But others thought it could be used for military purposes. We had a conversation on that and will have a conversation in the future as well. China is in power and present in the Indian Ocean sending their ships across. So we will have to have a conversation to ensure India what is a threat and talk on those lines,” he underlined. “Our position is what is a threat to India is a threat to us,” he pointed out. Touching on the debt issue, he said, “I don’t think we are caught in a Chinese debt trap.” He added that Sri Lanka’s location in the Indian Ocean has been the biggest opportunity and the biggest challenge. “Opportune means we could have become a very fast-growing country and be the gateway to the Indian sub-continent like Hong Kong to China and Netherlands to Europe.” He also pointed out that the Trincomalee Port is the strategic port and not Hambantota. With its natural harbour, second best in the world, any ship can come to Trincomalee Port as it is deepwater port. We have a natural blessing, he added. On the outer harbour, a massive British ship sank during World War II. Despite this, any ship could enter the port. “It is that deep.” Someone taking over the Trincomalee Harbour has been speculated to be a threat to the region and the world, he added. Today, geopolitics has changed and it keeps changing and Sri Lanka cannot control geopolitics, he stressed.

Further, there are projections that exports of coconut-related products will generate an impressive USD 2 billion in revenue over the next decade. The decision to establish a second Coconut Triangle was driven by the fact that a majority of coconut production is consumed locally, with only a third being designated for export."

A new dawn that promises to steer the island nation toward a future marked by economic stability, warm diplomatic relations, and strong democratic values. As he stands on the cusp of this transformative journey, Maumoon is a name synonymous with proven commitment, vision, and dedication. His story is not just that of a statesman, but a tale of perseverance and impactful leadership. Born into a legacy of statesmanship, Faris has carved his path with distinction. His journey from education to politics showcases a relentless pursuit of knowledge, underscoring his commitment to the betterment of the Maldives. Reflecting on his journey, Faris attributes his unwavering dedication to the values instilled in him by his parents. He fondly recalls his father, former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, and his mother, Madam Nasreena Ibrahim, as his guiding lights. “Their commitment to the betterment of the Maldives has been a constant source of inspiration to me,” he says, discussing their legacy with a profound sense of respect, emphasising how his parents’ tireless work in shaping the island nation’s trajectory ignited his own passion for serving the Maldivian people. Having completed his higher studies in England and Australia, Faris returned to his homeland armed with a Bachelor’s Degree in Combined Social Sciences and a Master’s Degree in International Relations. This academic foundation would later become the bedrock upon which he would build his political and economic initiatives. In 2005, Faris embarked on his political career, being among the initial 50 signatories to the formation of the “Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party” (DRP) and playing a pivotal role in establishing multiparty democracy in the Maldives. His leadership acumen was demonstrated when he spearheaded the campaign for the historic 2008 multiparty Presidential Election. The subsequent founding of the Progressive Party of the Maldives (PPM) in 2011 further showcased his ability to navigate complex political landscapes. Under his strategic guidance, the PPM achieved a remarkable series of victories within just three years, winning the Presidential Election in 2013, a parliamentary majority in 2014, and the Local Council Elections in 2017. Faris’ achievements within this short time frame testify to his visionary leadership and dedication to rapid progress. Beyond party leadership, Faris served as the Minister of State for Economic Development from 2013 to 2015, introducing transformative economic policies that catalysed inclusive growth. His initiatives, such as microfinance schemes and the “GetSet Loan” programme aimed at youth empowerment, showcased his commitment to creating an enabling environment for small and medium-sized enterprises. Notably, Faris’ advocacy extended to the legislative sphere, where his commitment to democratic values shone through. His opposition to amendments with potentially negative implications for the freedoms and governance of the Maldivian People demonstrated his unwavering dedication to the preservation of democratic principles. His courage was particularly evident when he challenged amendments targeting the national law on assemblies, a move that led to his unjust detention. During this time, he was recognised as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. Maumoon’s vision for the Maldives is not just about a relentless push towards modernity though; it is a delicate blend of embracing progress while preserving tradition. He envisions a Maldives where economic sustainability and diplomatic relations go hand in hand, creating a prosperous nation with a global presence. His belief in transparent governance and inclusive growth echoes through his initiatives that aim to uplift every corner of the Maldives. In his own words, Faris envisions “a thriving modern society that never loses its connection to its traditional roots, and one ready to embrace the world, and one which the world looks forward to embracing in turn”. This sentiment encapsulates his vision for the Maldives – a nation that moves forward with the world while preserving its unique cultural identity. As he sets his sights on the Presidency of the Republic of the Maldives, Faris embodies hope, progress, and a dedication to a brighter future. His commitment to economic stability, sustainable development, warm diplomatic relations, and democratic values makes him a candidate whose vision resonates with the aspirations of the Maldivian people. Moving purposefully toward a prosperous tomorrow, Ahmed Faris Maumoon symbolises the shared Maldivian hope for change and the courage needed to endure through the challenges, and deliver it. He stands as the Maldives new rising sun, ready to steer the nation towards a bright new dawn, while remaining faithful to its rich culture, history and legacy."

A senior spokesman for the Health Ministry said on Friday (1) that this would help create competition rather than the existing monopoly in the supply of certain medicinal drugs. He said this would help control the present shortages of pharmaceuticals and increase in prices. During a discussion held between the Health Minister, the NMRA, State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC), the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and senior officials of the Health Ministry, the minister said problems arose from having only one supplier for certain medicines. These problems can be avoided if there are several suppliers. He said Minister Rambukwella advised the NMRA to speed up the process by following the necessary rules and procedures, especially towards suppliers who meet the proper qualifications. The spokesman said the Minister had also instructed his officials to maintain stocks of life-saving and essential medicinal drugs in the MSD so there would be sufficient medicines for one year. He said Rambukwella had informed his officials to pay more attention to essential medicines such as those required by cancer and kidney patients to maintain them in the country without any shortage.

Eye specialist Dr. Kanishka addressing the media briefing, said that despite various information circulating on social media, this disclosure is being made to the public due to the reluctance of many individuals to reveal the true situation. “We cannot accept responsibility for this situation. The public often blames the doctors for prescribing the wrong medicine. However, the primary responsibility for this catastrophe lies with the current government. The Government brings in various inferior medicines for its own benefit. Most of the drugs acquired through emergency purchases are inexpensive, such as the eye medicine Prednisolone,” he said. The doctors said that strict measures should be implemented to prevent the procurement of substandard medicines like this in the future. “While we are called doctors, in certain instances we feel like patients ourselves, as the Government’s actions have pushed us into such a predicament. A number of doctors are leaving the country due to the Government’s inadequate treatment and lack of provision of necessary facilities. As a result, the doctors who remain are forced to handle the workload equivalent to that of two or three doctors per day,” Dr. Kanishka said. “This situation places immense pressure on us as doctors. If it persists, our ability to work effectively and attentively with patients will be compromised. Continuation of this trend will lead to the collapse of the healthcare sector, eroding public confidence in the country’s healthcare system,” he stressed. The government has not offered any compensation or relief to those affected following the eye surgeries. Even if compensation were provided, its duration would be limited if sight is not restored, Dr. Kanishka emphasised adding  that the need was to offer more than just compensation to these innocent patients.

Last year’s decision by the Sri Lankan Government to open the fuel import and retail sales market to oil-producing nations, led to the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Bill’s approval. This paved the way for global companies like Sinopec to enter as importers, distributors, and retail operators for petroleum products.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/01/pattern-of-non-compliance-with-rti-act-has-emerged-verite/,Pattern of non-compliance with RTI Act has emerged – Verite,Author not found,0,2023-08-31T20:32:00+00:00,"A concerning pattern of non-compliance with the Right to Information (RTI) Act has emerged within Sri Lanka’s governance landscape, particularly concerning infrastructure projects, alleged Verité Research, a private think-tank. Issuing a statement, Verité Research claimed that in 2022 and 2023, a mere 18% and 25% of the required information for these projects was proactively disclosed online, respectively. Adding to this breach, the available information was predominantly presented in English, disregarding the RTI Act’s mandate of disclosure in Sinhala and Tamil, with English being the secondary option. In 2022, only 18% of the information was accessible in English, while a mere 5% and 4% were offered in Sinhala and Tamil, respectively. These alarming figures persisted in 2023, where 25% was available in English, and only 8% in both Sinhala and Tamil, the statement said. Verité Research’s Infrastructure Watch, hosted on the publicfinance.lk platform, which tracked government adherence to the RTI Act’s proactive disclosure obligations for 60 projects valued at Rs 1.08 trillion in 2022, and 60 projects worth Rs 2.54 trillion in 2023. The 2023 assessment included 37 ongoing projects from the previous year, alongside 23 new ones. “Assessment timelines for the 2022 and 2023 projects spanned from January to April of the respective years. The evaluation solely considered the proactive release of information on the official websites of the responsible Ministries and line-agencies. Mandated by Section 9 of the RTI Act No. 12 of 2016, the responsible Minister for an infrastructure project is obligated to divulge project details. These disclosures are mandatory for both foreign and locally funded projects exceeding USD 100,000 and LKR 500,000 respectively, at least three months before initiation. The information should span five key categories: project specifics, rationale and beneficiaries, budget and financial particulars, approvals and authorisations, and procurement details,” the statement said. Sri Lanka’s large-scale infrastructure initiatives have faced allegations ranging from corruption to procurement misconduct, exorbitant costs, and disregard for environmental impacts. Loans procured over the past two decades to support these endeavors have exacerbated the nation’s debt burden. Transparency serves as a crucial antidote to the issues shadowing infrastructure ventures in Sri Lanka. Introduced in 2016, the RTI Act aimed to achieve this by granting public access to essential government data, empowering citizens to hold the government accountable. “Moreover, publicising procurement contracts through an online fiscal transparency platform to curb corruption aligns with commitments made to the IMF. Yet, the assessment has unveiled a concerning reality: vital information critical for improving infrastructure governance, such as project approvals, clearances, and procurement details, remains obscured from public view,” Verité Research."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/01/no-2-heavy-transport-squadron-celebrates-66th-anniversary/,No. 2 Heavy Transport Squadron Celebrates 66th Anniversary,Author not found,0,2023-08-31T20:32:00+00:00,"‘Heavy Lifters’, No. 2 Heavy Transport Squadron, steps into its 66th year of proud service to the motherland today (1 September 2023). At the inception, the Royal Ceylon Air Force had only a few aircraft housed in the No. 1 Squadron. Later, with the development of the Royal Ceylon Air Force to its capacity during the leadership of Air Vice Marshal JL Barker, the requirement arose for a separate Training Squadron and an Operational Squadron. As a result, on 1 September 1957, the No. 1 Squadron was split into two, setting up the No. 2 Squadron. Initially, the No. 2 squadron comprised Oxford Airspeed, Prestwick Pioneer, De-Havilland Dove aircraft and also the S-51 Dragonfly helicopter, which was the first helicopter of the Royal Ceylon Air Force. Initially, the squadron was located at SLAF Base Katunayake carrying out Transport and Patrol duties. In September 1959, two De Havilland Herons were purchased directly from England and ferried to the squadron to enhance its operational capability. These were ferried all the way from south London by a local aircrew. The arrival of Herons opened the door to the Royal Ceylon Air Force’s global operations, which extended as far as Indonesia to the east and Cairo to the west. These international flights provided enough experience to the pilots as well as navigators of the fast-developing Royal Ceylon Air Force. In 1973, the squadron received the Convair 440 aircraft into service from Eastern Airlines, USA, to boost operations of HELITOURS between Ceylon and the Maldives. In 1975, the DC 3 Dacotas came into operation, and towards the end of 1979, an HS 748 Avro was absorbed into the No. 2 Squadron fleet. From the period of 1983 to 1985, the squadron acquired three Siai Marchetti SF 260TPs, oneAvro and one Beech King aircraft. With the inception of the SF 260 TPs, the squadron was capable of carrying out a combat role in support of Eelam War I. In 1985, with the expansion of Katunayake International Airport, No. 2 Squadron was shifted to Ratmalana. In 1986, another HS 748 (Avro), five (05) SF 260 TPs and two (02) Y-12 aircraft were added to the squadron inventory. With new aircraft, the squadron expanded its role to Commercial Flights and Aerial Survey missions other than transporting troops, VIPs and cargo. In the late 1980s, DC 3, Doves and Herons were ceased from operation. On 15 September 1992, a significant bit of restructuring of the No. 2 Transport Wing took place, dividing it into No. 201 Heavy Transport Squadron and No. 202 Light Transport Squadron. The No. 201 Squadron operated HS 748 Avro, Y-8 and Cessna 421 aircraft and the No. 202 Squadron operated Y-12 and Beech King Aircraft and both squadrons were under the command of the No. 2 Transport Wing. All technical data for the No. 201 Squadron was computerized in 1992. As a commercial venture, the SLAF Wet-leased two of its Avro aircraft to Air Lanka for a period of two months, from January to March 1992. On 08 November 1995 the No. 201 Squadron was re-designated as the No. 2 Heavy Transport Squadron and the No. 202 Squadron as the No. 8 Light Transport Squadron, which operated under separate commands. Three Antonov 32B aircraft joined the fleet of No. 2 Squadron in the same year. But this period became the darkest period of the No. 2 Squadron’s history, during which two HS 748 aircraft, two AN 32 aircraft and a Y-8 aircraft were shot down by the enemy during operational flights carried out to SLAF Palaly. In 1996, four AN 32 aircraft were acquired by the squadron to cater to the increased demand for transport in support of the ongoing operations and also to replace the two AN 32s lost in 1995. To extensively increase the lift capability, the squadron took delivery of two C-130 Hercules aircraft in late 2000. Other three (03) AN 32s were also added to the fleet in the same year. The present Commander of the Sri Lanka Air Force, Air Marshal RAUP Rajapaksa, served as a Commanding Officer during the period of 1 January 2010 to 28 March 2011 and was a pillar of knowledge and strength to many pilots of the Air Force. The first Commanding Officer of the wing was Flight Lieutenant P.H. Mendis and presently Wing Commander H.M.M. Samarakoon commands the No. 2 Squadron as the acting Commanding Officer. As the No. 2 Squadron spans its commitment over 66 years of distinguished service in the Combat Support Operations in the role of air transportation in the SLAF, the contributions that has made to the country in terms of military and civil requirement are colossal and intangible notably, the assistance provided throughout the humanitarian operations and establishing air diplomacy in the events of regional disasters. Currently, the No. 2 Squadron shelters classic Lockheed C-130 Hercules and AN-32B aircraft together with a dynamic and professional team of aircrew and engineers who are tirelessly work hard to keep the flag flying throughout. In many of the past years, it has been considerably accepted that the largest percentage of flying has been carried out by the No. 2 Squadron and the commitment of the squadron was above 50% of the total air operation hours done by the Air Force from 1996 to 2005. During this period, many pilots of the squadron made the supreme sacrifice in the face of the enemy. However, the squadron continued to discharge the responsibility in the challenging environment, willingly with its remaining pilots and kept the lifeline intact in the northern peninsular. Although the designated role of the squadron may sound limited in its area of responsibility, throughout its life span, No. 2 Squadron has flown into many divested fields of air operations to keep with the slogan of the SLAF."

A.D.K.S.N. Yasawardene and R.

The duo alleged that the transfer letter had included, a false reason mentioned (“service need”). There are several, similar, ad hoc decisions taken by senior medical administrators in the recent past, which led to total chaos in the well organised specialist medical care of this country. The AMS President and Secretary accused the Ministry of Health and the Director of Tertiary Care of having been unable to even implement a ruling of Professional misconduct given against JMO Ruhul Haq. “The SLMC is the highest body in this country to deliver a ruling on Professional Misconduct of a medical practitioner and that ruling is communicated to the relevant practitioner and his employer – the Health Ministry,” they noted.   Drs Yasawardene and Gnanasekeram pointed out that it was the duty of the Health Ministry to implement this ruling to the letter without looking for any lame excuses. The duo lamented that medical specialists had to face numerous challenges when they worked in the present environment.  They include lack of infrastructure, administrative pro-activity and facilities. “Medical specialists who return from abroad with focused and intense training in overseas centres of excellence, get disheartened under such circumstances, although they have the keen desire and motivation to serve Sri Lanka with dedication,” The President and Secretary of the AMS observed noting that the arrogant and unprofessional behaviour of some of the medical administrators in the present setup only precipitated the exodus of medical practitioners.  (DJ)"

This camera system would be introduced before 30 September. He made this revelation during a discussion held with reps of firms engaged in liquor production, at the Head Office of the Excise Department recently. During this discussion the Excise Commissioner General maintained that the market had been proliferated with liquor bottles containing counterfeit stickers. Jayasinghe also stated during this meeting that President had personally instructed him to bring to book all those found guilty of the said racket and the firms involved in it. He said, those engaged in the racket of placing counterfeit stickers on liquor bottles will be prosecuted to the sternest letter of the law. Jayasinghe, therefore, warned that those firms which are guilty of placing counterfeit stickers on liquor bottles could face the danger of their licences being revoked by the Government. He explained that the said racket could not have taken place without the blessings of the firms involved in the production of liquor and those involved in retail sales. He opined that if the racket is not rooted out it will also deal a severe blow to the income accrued by the State via the industry. Jayasinghe also said, a centralised monitoring camera system will be shortly initiated to combat all irregularities taking place with regard to placing of counterfeit stickers and overcoming such incidents. He also instructed liquor firm reps to install such camera systems within their respective institutions before 30 September. The officials from the Excise Department who had taken part in the discussion had stated that such incidents taking place when their work is being monitored by a few Parliament Select Committees (PSCs) will not augur well for their image in the eyes of the public and they have urged the Excise Commissioner General to move in the matter promptly and eradicate the rackets as it could deal a massive blow to State coffers if allowed to operate as of now. Meanwhile, the Excise Trade Union Collective (ETUC) issuing a media release states that all officers of the Excise Department should not be held responsible for the racket of placing counterfeit stickers on liquor bottles. Its Co-Secretary Nirosh Jayakody said, a set of officers from the Department who are protecting those from the Indian firm involved in supplying these security stickers and the said Indian firm known as Madras Security Printers (MSP) should be held accountable for it. The ETUC states that raids to seize liquor bottles with counterfeit stickers had been conducted since the start of August, but had noted that reviews being carried out into those raids had not been satisfactory. The ETUC has added that due to this situation they had requested the Excise Commissioner General in writing to look into this matter urgently. They have also mentioned that due to several shortcomings, on the part of the MSP, the ongoing racket had continued unabated and they have urged the Excise Commissioner General to investigate it promptly. They have lastly pointed out that the Indian firm which had been selected via a tender process to supply the security stickers had been blacklisted in a few countries after being guilty of committing several irregularities and the ETUC has observed that concerns raised by them in this regard had not been heeded either by the Excise Commissioner General or any of his officers. They have stressed that an unknown and a mysterious force is operating from behind the scenes in conjunction with the Indian firm in question and that they would reveal further details shortly."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/31/no-outsider-allowed-to-enter-site-president/,No outsider allowed to enter site – President,Author not found,0,2023-08-30T20:36:00+00:00,"As a step to address the controversy that erupted with regard to the Kurunthamalai Temple, no outsider will be permitted to enter the site going forward, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said. The President made this remark when he visited Kandy to observe the Kandy Sri Dalada Perahera and met Mahanayake Theras and Anunayake Theras of Malwathu and Asgiriya Chapters. The President said, “Encouragingly, the Sinhalese, Muslim and Tamil communities of that area have united in agreement, pledging not to involve external entities. In times past, this region was characterised by harmonious coexistence among its inhabitants. Regrettably, the introduction of external groups has given rise to these recent complications. I have also communicated this matter to the Nayake Thera of Vavuniya region.” In light of these circumstances, it is imperative that access to this area is restricted exclusively to those within our sphere of influence. To ensure the integrity of our actions, the Department of Archaeology has been directed to conduct a thorough investigation. These actions align with the mandates of the Antiquities Act, underscoring our commitment to preserving our cultural heritage. Moreover, we are poised to undertake an excavation initiative at the esteemed Maha Viharaya. The ongoing excavation efforts in the Northern regions continue to yield valuable insights, and these undertakings remain in active progress. I wish to clarify that the preceding government took prompt action by deploying the armed forces to expedite the excavation process. However, a definitive course of action is still pending, awaiting the decision of the Department of Archaeology. Rest assured, our future steps will be in alignment with the verdict provided by this authoritative body. It is imperative to underscore our unwavering commitment to safeguarding these sacred regions, he said. The President also said the Government’s efforts extend to the safeguarding of all Buddhist shrines. Our approach begins with the identification of archaeological sites of significance. Following this crucial step, a comprehensive investigation ensues. Further, it is crucial to highlight our dedication to addressing any challenges faced by other religious communities in this context, he added. “I must emphatically state that we remain resolute in preventing external entities from instigating disturbances. To foster harmony and prevent potential conflicts, we are actively working towards appointing a committee comprising esteemed religious leaders from the respective provinces. The collective efforts of these leaders are poised to avert any arising conflicts,” the President pointed out. Addressing the country’s economic landscape, the President said the Government is presently transitioning out of financial turmoil. This revival is being facilitated through the implementation of a foreign debt optimisation programme and a series of substantial economic reforms. Presently, local banks are grappling with challenges, leading to restricted access to funds. A significant number of domestic banks find themselves burdened with debt, he said. “Should the banking system falter, it could precipitate severe financial repercussions. Moreover, the Central Bank has received liabilities from the Employees’ Provident Fund. Endeavours are underway to convert these liabilities into long-term bonds. While a marginal disparity in interest rates exists, it bears no detrimental impact on depositors. Notably, an agreement was reached last year to grant a 9 per cent interest to Employees’ Provident Fund depositors and I am steadfast in my commitment to enshrine this minimum interest rate into law.” Additionally, our efforts encompass the formulation of a new Central Bank Act. This step will pave the way for subsequent negotiations with our creditor nations. Concurrently, we will address personal loans, aspiring to either substantially reduce our debt burden or devise a sustainable repayment plan over the long term, the President noted. Speaking further, the President said it is the Government’s aspiration to convene discussions and finalise agreements with the International Monetary Fund by the conclusion of September or the onset of October. This accomplishment would signify our emergence from the shackles of bankruptcy, enabling us to engage in economic transactions with renewed ease. “Acknowledging the trade imbalance where imports surpass our exports, we are resolutely charting a course towards cultivating a competitive economic landscape. Central to this endeavour is the establishment of an export-oriented economy.” Meanwhile, Most Venerable Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Thera, the Anunayake of the Asgiriya Chapter, has expressed his appreciation for President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s significant contributions to the nation’s progress amidst challenging circumstances. During the President’s recent visit to the historic city of Kandy, the Venerable Thera highlighted the importance of understanding and endorsing the President’s endeavours. The Anunayake Thera noted that President Wickremesinghe’s efforts to rejuvenate Sri Lanka following adverse situations have been instrumental in moving the country forward. He lamented that some individuals fail to grasp the depth of these endeavours and urged the public to acknowledge the President’s commitment. Further, the Most Venerable Dhammadassi Thera expressed his confidence that the programmes initiated by President Wickremesinghe for the nation’s betterment will undoubtedly receive the blessings of the Maha Sangha, the community of Buddhist monks. President Wickremesinghe’s itinerary also included visits to other revered Buddhist leaders, including the Anunayake Thera of the Malwathu Chapter, the Most Venerable Dimbulkumbure Sri Vimaladhamma Thera, with whom he exchanged views. At the Asgiri Maha Viharaya, President Wickremesinghe received blessings from the Most Venerable Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thera, the Chief Prelate of the Asgiriya Chapter. The President participated in religious ceremonies at the Asgiriya Gedige Raja Maha Viharaya, underscoring his commitment to Buddhism and its values. The Anunayake Thera said, “Your role during this difficult period is paramount for the nation. The country once faced a significant economic downturn, and your efforts in leading its recovery are commendable. You’ve even personally endured losses, including property and your home. Your aptitude to offer solutions to the prevailing issues is noteworthy. We earnestly pray for divine support, safeguarded by the blessings of the Gods, Goddesses and the protection of the Sacred Tooth Relic.” The actions of the former President in safeguarding Buddhist shrines in the Eastern Province via the Defence Secretary were acknowledged. A programme was initiated to ensure their protection. Also, photo reports were submitted, however, concerns were raised about the present status of this endeavour. Additionally, the issue of external interference creating conflicts in the vicinity of the Kurundi Viharaya was highlighted, urging action."

A vigilant Australian woman, who was awaiting immigration clearance, noticed the individual discreetly passing through the counter and promptly alerted the authorities. Despite the best efforts of the officers, along with assistance from the concerned Australian passenger, they were unable to locate him. Later, after reviewing CCTV footage, they identified the passenger and cross-referenced his passport and boarding pass details. It came to light that he was on a no-fly list. Given that the flight had already entered Indian airspace, the Immigration and Emigration officers communicated with the Captain and Operations Manager at the Mumbai Airport, apprising them of the situation.

The Senator, who is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, expressed concern that a situation where China negotiates a more favourable deal at the expense of Sri Lanka’s people and economy would not be appropriate. Emphasising the significance of support from the IMF for Sri Lanka, the Senator of Maryland said, “The Paris Club and India said to take steps to ensure that their creditor arrangements are on par with the terms offered. These creditors made sure that they have the same arrangement as China. It’s inappropriate for China to pursue more favourable conditions at the cost of Sri Lanka’s populace, given the current timing and urgency of the issue. It is of utmost significance that the country’s primary creditor refrains from exploiting its leverage to the detriment of a comprehensive agreement. Such an agreement holds immense importance for both the people of Sri Lanka and its economy,” he said. The US Senator is in Sri Lanka as a part of a three-nation (Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives) tour and to focus on ways the US can further assist efforts to overcome Sri Lanka’s economic crisis and discuss the way forward on human rights and reconciliation. Senator Van Hollen emphasised the significance of support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Sri Lanka. He noted that the IMF’s USD 3 billion assistance is crucial to help stabilise Sri Lanka’s economy. Without this agreement with the IMF, Sri Lanka’s economic situation would spiral downward. On the Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) programme where people are agitated about using deposits from sources like the Employees’ Provident Fund to address domestic debt, the Senator acknowledged that these decisions are by the Sri Lankan Government, and he highlighted the importance of considering social safety net issues as discussions on this matter continue. Senator Van Hollen said he believed that the IMF’s assistance, combined with effective debt restructuring decisions by the Sri Lankan Government, is crucial for turning around Sri Lanka’s economy. He stressed the need to consider the vulnerabilities of the population while making these decisions. Apart from economic matters, the Senator’s visit also aimed to discuss human rights and reconciliation efforts in Sri Lanka and to meet the civil society as well. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

In response, Principal of Dutugemunu Model School in Buttala, Sampath Dissanayake, has launched an innovative programme aimed at encouraging proper hydration among students. Under this initiative, after each class period, a designated student takes the floor and addresses the class in English, saying, “Attention, let’s drink water.” Thereafter, all the students promptly reach for their bottles of water and quench their thirst. This practice is embraced not only by the students but also by the teachers. Dissanayake, explaining the rationale behind this approach, said, “Given the ongoing dry spell, we recognised the importance of tackling student fatigue and dehydration. Thus, we formulated this programme, which involves assigning a student leader within the class to prompt their peers to drink water. We decided to convey this reminder in English, using just two simple sentences. This innovative approach comprises various segments designed to facilitate seamless classroom management for our teachers. Beyond hydration, the programme instils an understanding among the children about the significance of water for maintaining a healthy body. Further, it provides a platform to enhance their English speaking skills and fosters leadership abilities, including among students who may need additional support.” By G.I. Roshan – Wellawaya"

Australia’s engagement has helped bridge the gaps in Sri Lanka’s tourism and hospitality market and support Sri Lanka in its path to become a tourist-ready destination.” Chairman of Dilmah, Dilhan Fernando, added: “My father first launched Dilmah Tea in Australia and the enduring connection we have with Australians is linked to the opportunity they gave a small but passionate Sri Lankan business to grow. We celebrate this anniversary of our friendship as two nations united by a love for Ceylon Tea.” Peter Kuruvita, sharing his thoughts, said: “It is a great honour to be cooking this dinner, and amazing that we can support the youth in Sri Lanka with initiatives from both the Australian Government and Dilmah Tea. The Dilmah culinary school and the Supreme Chef competition have given these underprivileged kids the opportunity to become chefs and help improve their lives.”"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer.

MCPA President, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa yesterday (29) said that according to international health regulations, locals travelling abroad – especially to countries where yellow fever was endemic– should take the vaccine. It was not long ago that the MCPA warned that the shortage of the meningococcal vaccines against meningitis could lead to an epidemic of the disease. He lamented that the health authorities had not paid much attention to the situation at the time when cases with brain fever had been detected from the Galle area. According to the international health regulations of the World Health Organisation (WHO), preventing yellow fever was an essential responsibility of every health system. An international project known as ‘Eliminating Yellow Fever Epidemic’ or EYE- 2026 was implemented. He noted that member countries of the WHO should abide by the project. According to EYE-2026 guidelines, three-pronged measures were to be taken in order to control the disease. They included identifying the risk groups of yellow fever, providing advice and treatment to prevent it for people who go out of the country and the immediate implementation of the health system to control the situation in cases of a yellow fever epidemic, the MCPA President noted. The Audit Report issued recently by the National Audit Office has pointed out the weaknesses of International Health Regulations and strategies followed by the Health Ministry.

Rather, it was a reimbursement for the expenses incurred for beach cleaning by the MEPA, she claimed. She countered assertions that the funds were obtained during a trip to Singapore by a team led by the Attorney General, clarifying that this was simply a reimbursement from the Singaporean company for beach cleaning. Lahandapura told Ceylon Today that in accordance to the proposal put forth in 2022 to the Cabinet, she had communicated to P&I insurers that the compensation for beach cleaning payments should be made in USD, despite them saying they would settle the amount in LKR.  She also refuted claims that the funds were destined for the fishing community, clarifying that they were, in fact, intended to cover the costs that the MEPA had borne for the beach cleaning efforts. The owners of the X-press Pearl ship had committed to making these payments in installments and the installments are ongoing. Lahandapura emphasised that beach cleaning is an ongoing activity and highlighted that one payment covered the period from February 2022 to August, while the subsequent payment pertained to the period from August 2022 to February 2023. “There are instalments for the beach cleaning expenses, and this payment represents the third instalment, that had to reach MEPA but by then I left office,” she said. She revealed that the ship owners initially proposed compensating all dues in LKR, equivalent to USD, but she declined this arrangement. Instead, she pursued and secured a dollar settlement through a Cabinet paper. She also raised a question as to how did the P&I club settle Rs 16 million when the Cabinet paper clearly stipulated USD payments for all compensation and reimbursement from the vessel owners. She highlighted a delay in this payment of USD 878,000 as Sri Lanka Customs  prevented the ship owners from removing parts of the ship debris from Sri Lankan waters. In response, the ship owners had  refused to settle the beach cleaning payment. Subsequently, after being granted permission to tow away parts of the debris, the payment was eventually processed. The Justice Ministry said last week that this payment was designed to serve as compensation for the fishing community affected by the X-Pearl marine disaster. Minister Rajapakshe informed Parliament last week that the insurance company has agreed to extend this compensation despite the ongoing litigation in a Singapore Court, with no adverse impact on the legal proceedings. The insurers have decided to provide compensation within the framework of the case filed in the Commercial High Court in London, under the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims. Minister Rajapakshe was unavailable for comment with regard to Lahandapura’s claim. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

They extracted soil rich in gems from the area. The workers stressed that unauthorised miners had encroached upon the fertile tea land, resulting in some tea bushes being uprooted.

These fraudulent security labels were uncovered in over 100 wine stores in districts including Jaffna, Galle, Nuwara Eliya and Ratnapura during raids that were conducted. Pathirana brought these findings to light in Parliament last week, while posing oral inquiries to State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya. The parliamentarian also raised concerns about the involvement of certain high-ranking officials from the Excise Department in the operation of affixing fake security stickers to liquor bottles. He said there was a need to hold an impartial investigation to expose the individuals responsible for this activity and put an end to the scandal. He pointed out that the source of these bogus stickers was traced to a residence in Kochchikade, which is owned by a current Director of the Excise Department. Additionally, he highlighted previous incidents involving bribery allegations against two officials implicated in this case, which took place 19 years ago. In response to these revelations, Siyambalapitiya assured that the Government would initiate an independent investigation into the reported incidents. He underscored that anyone found guilty, regardless of their political stature, would face appropriate legal action. Siyambalapitiya further said that fixing security labels on liquor bottles had contributed to a considerable increase of Rs 19 billion in annual excise revenue, as proposed in the 2016 Budget. This initiative had also led to an 11 per cent rise in alcohol production. Despite these gains, the Government acknowledges the existence of such fraudulent schemes and is taking measures to address them. The plan involves conducting sample tests with the assistance of the Government Analyst and conducting investigations with assistance of the CID. In the light of these developments, he has instructed the Excise Commissioner General to intensify efforts to identify and curb the practice of placing counterfeit security labels on liquor bottles. Subsequent raids have led to the closure of numerous wine stores involved in the illegal operation with liquor stocks being confiscated. Meanwhile, a recent crackdown on liquor bottles bearing counterfeit security stickers comes in response to a directive from Parliament’s Ways and Means Committee. The committee had previously noted that despite being equipped with 200 machines capable of verifying the authenticity of security stickers, the Excise Department had not conducted any raids to confiscate liquor bottles suspected of carrying fake stickers since March. The initiative to implement security stickers on liquor bottles was initially proposed in the 2016 Budget. Subsequently, in 2017, tenders were solicited, and the contract to produce stickers was awarded to Madras Security Printers in 2018."

From November 2022 to date the Sri Lanka Embassy in Oman has facilitated repatriation of more than 400 stranded migrants with support extended by the Omani authorities. The Sri Lanka Embassy in Oman identified the group of 32 stranded illegal migrants and their situation was individually assessed to understand their circumstances and requirements.  The Embassy engaged with the respective Government stakeholders in Oman to obtain visa overstay penalty waiver for the said group along with the necessary documentation and travel arrangements for repatriation. Throughout the repatriation process, the stranded workers were provided with essential humanitarian support, including medical assistance, accommodation, and access to basic necessities by the Sri Lanka Embassy in Oman.  The Oman Sri Lanka Social Club and many well-wishers supported the Embassy during this process. The Embassy said it strongly advises Sri Lankans not to arrive on visit/tourist visa without confirmed jobs, since many male and female workers are continuing to fall victim to human traffickers and end up in the streets under harsh weather conditions.  Hence, the Embassy requested all Sri Lankans to seek jobs only through licensed agencies and register with the SLBFE before arriving in Oman."

The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

Addressing a media briefing, at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), Minister Alles said the CID has concluded about 99 per cent of the investigations into the terror attack. “But, the Catholic Church and the Catholic community have always been holding press conferences and saying that this has not been done properly. The other thing is that the reports were given to the Catholic Church because they had not given the report prepared by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the attack for several years. I spoke to the President about it and provided the report to the Catholic Church,” he said.  Speaking further, the minister said, during the process of submitting these reports and even prior to that, he communicated to the Catholic Church that it was his intention to offer an opportunity for them to provide an explanation regarding the ongoing Police investigation. Despite the request for an opportunity to present their views, the Catholic Church has not conveyed its stance on this matter. “I urged them to thoroughly review all the facts presented to the bishops and other members of the Catholic Church. If they find any gaps or omissions in these facts, I encouraged them to bring it to light. I proposed a collaborative effort to address this. Unfortunately, the Catholic Church hasn’t taken the chance to engage in this discussion up to this point. Instead, different parties with varied agendas continue to perpetuate this issue.  I have consistently maintained that if the Catholic Church and its community genuinely seek to uncover the perpetrators and the sequence of events, they should join hands with us to comprehensively analyse this investigation,” Minister Alles said.  It’s important to acknowledge that there might be shortcomings in certain areas. Identifying these gaps is crucial. However, I am uncertain if the Catholic community possesses such a desire. To date, the Catholic Church hasn’t afforded us the opportunity to discuss this matter. The reason behind this remains unclear, he added. Moreover, the minister said that the Cardinal was the first to mention the mastermind behind these attacks. “Following that, the former Attorney General, on the day before his retirement, said that there was a mastermind. Upon being called to inquire further, he evaded. Subsequently, he pursued legal action and obtained a restraining order. If he had knowledge about the mastermind in question, he could have shared pertinent information. After the former AG avoided discussing this matter, the Cardinal’s statements regarding the mastermind also ceased.  My point is that there is a need for a comprehensive investigation, as the narratives being circulated are not necessarily accurate. That’s why I’ve extended an open invitation to delve into this matter,” he said.  He said that it should be found who was behind the attacks. However, it seems to me that most of the people are questioning the Police officers, asking where certain Police officers were and what they did,” he added. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

The force currently comprises approximately 85,000 officers. “Furthermore, the ministry has designed a specialiSed programme to combat the drug issue prevalent in the country. The southern region has witnessed a consistent increase in underworld activities. In response, the STF, the Police and other security units have collaboratively initiated targeted operations in these areas.

Speaking at a media briefing, held at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), Minister Alles said, “Nagamuwa alleged that the JVP and I invested money together. In response to this allegation, I took the necessary steps. I filed a complaint with the CID and provided a statement. However, now that Nagamuwa has been asked to give a statement, he is nowhere to be found. It appears he is avoiding this. If the FSP possesses any evidence, they are welcome to present it to the CID.” Speaking further, the minister said FSP Education Secretary Pubudu Jagoda said in a television talk show that what FSP meant was they had suspicions about a possible political deal between him and the JVP.  “We had a political deal together since 2010. It was in 2010 that I, JVP, General Sarath Fonseka, Arjuna Ranatunga, formed a party and were elected to parliament together. At that time Jagoda and Nagamuwa too were with the JVP. They were at my office during the whole election time because we worked together for the election in 2010,” the minister said.  (MD)"

Bhutan raised its ‘Sustainable Development Fee’ to USD 200 per visitor per night, from USD 65, when it ended two years of Covid restrictions in September last year saying the money would go to offset the carbon generated by visitors. The new rate of USD 100 per night would come into effect from September and last for four years, the government said in a statement on 25 August. “This is in view of the important role of the tourism sector in generating employment, earning foreign exchange and boosting overall economic growth,” it said. Isolated for generations, Bhutan opened to tourists in 1974 when it received 300 visitors. The number soared to 315,600 in 2019, up 15.1% from a year earlier, official data showed. Bhutan has always been wary of the impact of mass tourism and it bans mountain climbing to preserve the sanctity of its peaks. The tourist fee has limited arrivals to bigger spenders who make up a fraction of the numbers that visit nearby Nepal. Nevertheless, Bhutan hopes to raise the contribution of tourism to its USD 3 billion economy 20%, from about 5%. Dorji Dhradhul, director general of the Department of Tourism, said halving the tourist fee could boost arrivals in the September-December peak tourist period, which includes many religious and cultural events in the mainly Buddhist country. In June, the government eased rules on the length of stay and fees for tourists but numbers have not picked up as expected. Dhradhul said more than 56,000 tourists had visited Bhutan since January but about 42,000 were Indian nationals, who only have to pay a fee of 1,200 Indian rupees (USD 14.5) a day. About 50,000 Bhutanese are employed in tourism which earned about $84 million a year in the three years before the pandemic in foreign exchange. (CNN)"

Wijeysuriya, said that testing and issuing medicines had proved a big issue but that steps had been taken to direct patients to pharmacies and lab facilities close to hospitals. He noted that the Government footed the bill for the expenses incurred in the private sector during the strike yesterday (24). Meanwhile, patients being treated in State Hospitals faced severe inconveniences due to the token strike. While some patients kept away from the pharmacy counters in certain State Hospitals, there were also a sizeable number of patients, who had come for laboratory tests, faced with the dilemma of how to have their tests carried out. Meanwhile, Co-Convener Joint Council of the Joint Council of Professions Supplementary to Medicine (JCPSM) Chanaka Dharmawickrama said that discussions held with the Health Secretary had been successful. However, the issue was their implementations owing to the machinations of those officials under him. He noted that his outfit would give the Health Secretary and his officials seven days to implement the demands that have been made before taking further action. The JCPSM struck work making seven demands, including expediting the recruitment procedure, delays in the issuance of the circular related to grade promotion issues, the decision taken by the Health Ministry to stop new recruitments and the suppression of trade unions by taking unfair disciplinary measures against the leaders.

Additionally, the recently established grid substation in Hambantota was energised yesterday (24). Financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the initiative received a USD 55 million investment aimed at enhancing the Polpitiya-Hambantota 220kV transmission line and constructing the new Hambantota grid substation. As stated by the CEB, this transmission line, stretching 150km, spans across 11 Divisional Secretariats from Ambagamuwa to Hambantota, boasting a line capacity of 580MVA. The Hambantota new grid substation has been finalised, featuring two power transformers with a combined capacity of 500MVA. This enhancement to the transmission network substantially reinforces the southern sector of the electricity grid. Consequently, the reliability of power supply and the capacity for power transfer to and from the Southern region are significantly improved, the CEB said. Earlier this month, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) effectively mediated a resolution to a dispute involving the CEB and landowners in the Siripagama area of Ratnapura. This dispute centered around a portion of the transmission line connecting the national grid with the Southern Province, which traverses the aforementioned land. Initially, private assessors recommended a compensation of Rs 41 million for the land utilised in constructing a 630-meter segment of the transmission line. Following the criteria of the Asian Development Fund of the ADB, this figure was later revised to Rs 9.6 million. However, the CEB only agreed to offer Rs 1.69 million as compensation. With the intervention of the PUCSL, the matter was resolved. The landowners demonstrated their dedication to ensuring uninterrupted electricity supply for the public by consenting to donate the land to the government without any compensation. This development cleared the path for commencing the construction of the transmission line. The agreed-upon terms encompassed the installation of the electric cable through the private land, maintaining a minimum height requirement of 20m and adhering to regulations regarding condition and continuity."

Addressing Parliament, Premadasa noted that India had successfully launched Chandrayaan-3 in 2023 after two earlier attempts by Chandrayaan-1 in 2008 and Chandrayaan-2 in 2019. He stated that for all three attempts, only USD 263 million had been spent. Premadasa urged the government to submit a report to Parliament regarding the massive expenditure on SupremeSAT and the success of the project in which Rohitha Rajapaksa, the youngest son of former Premier Mahinda Rajapaksa played a key role in the launch which is a Sri Lanka-China joint venture. “We, as a country, have gone backward after the satellite launch in Sri Lanka instead of landing on the moon,” he said. Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha said he was the Minister of Science, Technology and Research from 2015 to 2018 and that he was unaware of such a satellite being launched in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, Premadasa congratulated the Indian Government on the successful landing of Chandrayaan 3 on the moon. Chandrayaan 3, launched on 14 July, completed its journey and reached the South Pole of the Moon, making India the only country to achieve such a successful landing so far.

The Minister highlighted the success of the previous season, attributing it to the prompt distribution of essential fertiliser varieties to farmers, coupled with financial benefits. Robust yields in regions unaffected by drought further bolstered the season’s prosperity. Speaking at an expert gathering, hosted by the President’s Trade Union Relations Division, at the Presidential Secretariat, on the topic of ‘Modernisation of the Agro-Industrial Sector and its Challenges,’ Amaraweera provided an in-depth insight into the agricultural landscape. He shared his views on the necessity of enhancing the agro-industrial sector to tackle contemporary challenges. These perspectives underscore the Ministry’s commitment to optimising the agricultural landscape while reaffirming the nation’s capacity to fulfill its rice requirements through strong domestic resources. Amaraweera elaborated, “At the beginning of President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s tenure, a crucial objective was to enhance farmers’ involvement in agricultural activities, redirecting their focus from protests. This initiative was launched during a cultivation preparation phase. Despite aiming to cultivate 275,000 hectares, the scarcity of fertilisers posed a significant hindrance. While some were criticised for causing unwarranted panic, even the international community anticipated potential food shortages. “Through determined efforts, we succeeded in motivating farmers to return to their fields. This commitment led to the cultivation of 512,000 hectares during the Yala season. “Additionally, around 800,000 hectares were cultivated during the Maha season. In that specific year, our country imported 800,000 metric tons of rice. Nonetheless, the looming possibility of rice imports this year presents a substantial challenge, exacerbated by India’s ongoing embargo on rice exports.”"

Among the counterfeits were oil filters, data cables and phone chargers, all falsely bearing the names of well-known international brands. According to a statement by Sri Lanka Customs, this act was conducted with a commitment to upholding Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and enhancing business trust. The Director General of Customs, P. B. S. C. Nonis, supported by Additional Director General Asoka Ranjith and Senior Director M. S. J. De Silva, oversaw the the destruction. “The confiscated items included things like electronics, household stuff, trendy items, and car parts. The goal of destroying these goods is to stop fake products from spreading. These fakes harm real businesses and could be risky for people who use them. This move also reminds people to be careful when buying things. Especially online, it’s important to buy from real businesses that care about safety and quality,” the statement said. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are things like patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. Fake goods hurt the economy, brand names, and can even be bad for people. It’s important to protect these rights so that new ideas can grow, and things can be fair for everyone. Customs help by stopping fake goods from coming into the market. Sri Lanka Customs has a special group called the ‘Consumer Protection Unit’. This group makes sure consumers are safe. They catch and take fake things based on information they find. Customs officials can do all of this because of the law and rules about intellectual property. They also follow agreements with other countries to do this job well, the statement said.

Premadasa made these statements yesterday (23,) during his response to questions under Standing Order 27 (2) in Parliament. He highlighted the potential collapse of the health system due to mismanagement of human resources. The departure of doctors without notice, reluctance of specialist doctors who study abroad to return, and the unwillingness of new doctors to work for the Ministry of Health were contributing to a shortage of medical professionals in the country. Premadasa warned that this shortage, including a dearth of specialists was jeopardising the quality of healthcare in Sri Lanka. Premadasa emphasised the need for the Government to implement a programme that provides satisfactory working conditions for doctors. He criticised the Government for not responding effectively to the brain drain issue that was highlighted months ago, leading to the departure of many healthcare professionals. He stated that the Ministry of Health took action only after the situation had escalated, and such problems could have been prevented if the Government had acted proactively. To address the shortage of doctors, Premadasa proposed alternative methods to produce high-quality medical professionals without compromising free education. He emphasised the importance of safeguarding free education. Premadasa also questioned the Ministry of Health’s alleged failure to obtain a vaccine recommended by the World Health Organization for infection control in the Galle prison. He pointed out that if the Health Minister or other top officials in the health sector are unable to answer simple questions posed under Standing Orders, it reflects poorly on the Government’s competence.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

This initiative has been set in motion under the guidance and instructions of Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva. The effort aligns with the Government’s decision to direct the youth of Sri Lanka towards the burgeoning employment prospects within the swiftly advancing port and maritime sectors, driven by modern technology. Set up in 1987 by the late Lalith Athulathmudali, who served as the Minister of Ports and Shipping, the Mahapola Ports & Maritime Academy has evolved into a globally recognised institution for higher education under SLPA.

Under the visionary leadership of Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, the MPMA has received directives to introduce new courses that specifically focus on the employment opportunities prevailing in the port and maritime sectors. The aim is to attract and enrol a larger number of young individuals into these programmes, providing them with the essential infrastructure and resources. The Minister has granted approval to recruit qualified professionals to deliver these courses effectively.  Presently, the academy awards around 2,000 diplomas annually, and the Minister intends to elevate this number by introducing fresh programmes and enhancing the existing ones.

Veteran planter Suresh Nawarathnam narrowly escaped an assault allegedly initiated by Jeevan Thondaman, shedding light on the safety and respect challenges faced by individuals in the industry. The event unfolded amidst a group of estate workers and has triggered calls for enhanced discipline and unity within the plantation sector. Lieutenant Col. Suresh Nawarathnam, a recognised figure in the planter circle due to his unwavering commitment to ethical practices, is being lauded for his integrity and leadership. It is emphasised that his unwavering dedication to upholding what is right is an inherent part of his character. The incident has ignited discussions about the intricacies of preserving discipline among planters, particularly when confronted with situations of intimidation. A coalition of both active and retired planters came forward to condemn the incident as a blatant act of intimidation. It is underscored that this occurrence transcends political dimensions, representing an attempt to exert dominance over a planter within the presence of a sizable group of estate workers. The coalition asserted that the implications of this incident must be communicated to higher authorities to ensure the maintenance of discipline within the industry. The episode involving Suresh Nawarathnam has spurred a broader conversation about the role of planters within society. Once held in high esteem, and often likened to government agents for their leadership and contributions, planters are now grappling with diminishing influence and recognition. This incident has galvanised a renewed call for planters to assert their importance for the collective benefit of the plantation industry and the profession as a whole. The incident has united numerous members of the plantation community, who are demanding that planters reclaim their rightful position as leaders and contributors to society. This occurrence is being viewed as an opportunity for the industry to coalesce, fortify its discipline, and stand resolute against any form of intimidation. In a profession celebrated for its resilience and restraint, the attempted assault on Suresh Nawarathnam serves as a stark reminder that unity and discipline remain integral to upholding the core values and principles that have guided the plantation community through generations. As the industry takes stock of this incident, the trajectory of this collective plea for transformation and its implications for the role of planters within society remains to be seen.

The committee met under the chairmanship of MP Gamini Valeboda and representatives of all major exporters’ associations including the United Garment Manufacturers’ Association, the Rubber Products Exporters’ Association, the Tea Products Exporters’ Association and the officials of the Ministry of Finance, Department of Inland Revenue were present and there was a lengthy discussion regarding the Government’s decision to remove the SVAT facility. Finance Ministry officials pointed out that the Government expects to take this decision to implement a successful tax system like the tax system in developed countries. But the exporters’ associations pointed out that even if there is no opposition regarding the removal of the SVAT facility, a proper mechanism must first be established in this country as in the developed countries. It was also discussed that due to the long time taken for VAT refunds/repayments, it directly affects the cash flow of exporters and even after 7 years of RAMIS system was established in 2016 and spent billions, it is a problem that an efficient system for tax collection and refunds has not yet been established. According to the Act, although taxes should be reimbursed within 45 days, it was discussed that taking a long time is a problem. Accordingly, corrupt situations have arisen to the extent that certain third-party groups, including officials, act as brokers for quick reimbursement of tax money. It was also revealed that according to the Cabinet decision related to removing the SVAT facility, if this facility is removed, a proper system should be established first. Although officials of the Inland Revenue Department have said that the Government is losing revenue through the SVAT system, the committee pointed out that the problem is that they do not present sufficient figures to confirm it correctly. Therefore, the Chairman said a report on this matter should be submitted to the committee within a week. Also, he instructed the department to present clearly what is the alternative programme for VAT reimbursement if this SVAT facility is removed. He also called on export industrialists to  submit a comprehensive report with  quantitative data to the committee within a week. The chairman emphasised that protecting the export industries, which play a huge role for the economy of the country, is a national responsibility and that the Sectoral Oversight Committees will constantly advocate for it. He further said according to all these facts, recommendations are expected to be submitted to the Government through the Parliament. It was also revealed that according to the Cabinet decision related to removing the SVAT facility, if this facility is removed, a proper system should be put in place first."

The spacecraft landed on the unexplored south pole of the Moon on Wednesday evening, days after Russia’s Luna-25 failed, making India the first country to achieve that feat. “The Ch-3 Rover ramped down from the Lander and India took a walk on the moon!” the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said in its message on Thursday morning. The six-wheeled, solar-powered rover, named Pragyan (or wisdom” in Sanskrit) will amble around the relatively unmapped region and transmit images and scientific data over its two-week lifespan. Accomplished with a budget of about 6.15bn Indian rupees (USD 74.58m), this was India’s second attempt to touch down on the Moon. A previous mission in 2019, Chandrayaan-2, successfully deployed an orbiter but its lander crashed. Chandrayaan means ‘moon vehicle’ in Hindi and Sanskrit. The Moon’s rugged South Pole is coveted because of its water ice, which is believed to be capable of providing fuel, oxygen and drinking water for future missions, but its rough terrain makes landing challenging. People across the country tuned in to watch the landing on Wednesday, with more than seven million people viewing the YouTube livestream alone. Prayers were also held at places of worship, and schools organised live screenings of the spectacle for students. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Wednesday that the successful lunar landing – previously achieved only by the United States, Russia and China – was a triumph for ‘all of humanity’. Elon Musk, whose firm SpaceX is a leader in commercial space launches, hailed the landing as “super cool”. India has a comparativelylow-budget space programme, but one that has grown considerably in size and momentum since it first sent a probe to orbit the Moon in 2008. Chandrayaan-3’s cost was far lower than many missions from other countries and a testament to India’s frugal space engineering. In 2014, India became the first Asian nation to put a craft into orbit around Mars and plans to send a probe towards the sun in September. ISRO is slated to launch a three-day crewed mission into Earth’s orbit by next year. It also plans a joint mission with Japan to send another probe to the Moon by 2025 and an orbital mission to Venus within the next two years. (Al Jazeera)"

A discrepancy has been highlighted between the promised pay grade and the actual pay grade provided upon absorption into the In-Service Adviser role. Those affected by this disparity assert that their remuneration falls below their previous salary. These issues were deliberated at a recent meeting of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Education, chaired by MP V. Radhakrishnan in Parliament. The committee collectively identified the unjust nature of offering a lower compensation than the salary earned after years of service when transitioning to an In-Service Adviser position. Consequently, the committee recommended a temporary suspension of appointments until the matter is resolved. During the committee meeting, Opposition Leader SajithPremadasa, sought clarification from officials about measures undertaken to fill the 1,982 vacancies in the In-Service Adviser positions. Additionally, he inquired about the evolving responsibilities and scope of the In-Service Adviser roles. The committee agreed that while numerous concerns persist, enforcing the absorption of teachers into the In-Service Adviser role without due consideration is unacceptable and warrants further discussion. The committee also engaged in discussions about establishing an effective mechanism to oversee Nursery Education and Nursery Schools in Sri Lanka. Officials disclosed that the National Policy for Pre-School Education had been available on the Ministry of Education’s website for public input for nearly a month. Consequently, an Action Plan for the National Policy for Pre-School Education had been collaboratively developed with the participation of relevant institutions and departments. The committee emphasised the need to unify the diverse provincial policies governing Nursery Education and Nursery Schools under a comprehensive national policy. Furthermore, with regards to early childhood and nursery education, conversations were held regarding the regulation of private tuition classes on Sundays and public holidays. The committee raised concerns about certain chapters in the syllabus that seemingly endorsed gender discrimination, advocating for their review. Accordingly, the committee recommended addressing these issues concurrently with the ongoing education reform programme. An inquiry into the progress of the Mid-Day-Meal programme implemented in schools across the country was also conducted during the committee meeting. Officials stated that the programme provides lunch to 1.8 million students across 7,926 schools. MPs Rohini Kumari Wijerathna, Manjula Dissanayake, and Dr. Charitha Herath, were in attendance at the meeting. Additionally, the Opposition Leader and MP Chandima Weerakkody participated in the meeting with the permission of the Committee Chair."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

This is with reference to the Pesticide Action Network (PAN) International consolidated list of banned pesticides,6th Edition in May 2022. Accordingly, 14 out of those 40 HHPs, have been recommended for domestic use in Sri Lanka. Speaking at a media briefing yesterday (23), CEJ Senior Adviser Hemantha Withanage said according to global research the HHPs are linked to cancers, tumours, nervous system disorders, reproductive problems, immune system effects as well as endocrine system disruption. “Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, the attention paid to these dangers is close to zero. There is not enough research conducted in Sri Lanka with regard to these pesticides. The impact of HHPs on women and children due to exposure while accompanying the family at crop fields has not been documented properly in Sri Lanka,” Withanage pointed out. According to the report, on average within five years, 2,181 MT of herbicides, 1,183 MT of insecticides and 896 MT of fungicides were imported annually. They are all released to soil, water and air creating many exposure pathways to the people, in addition to the farmers who directly deal with them. Meanwhile, CEJ Environmental Officer Supun Sanjeewa said they forwarded the findings with regard to the 40 HHPs to the Office of the Registrar of Pesticides as well. “A Deputy Director of the Office of the Registrar of Pesticides said recommendations are being given annually with regard to the pesticides and they were not aware of the PAN International list of HHPs when giving recommendations last time,” he said.

The Vikram lander made a soft lunar landing at 6:04 p.m. IST yesterday (23). ISRO started the automatic landing sequence at 5:44 p.m. IST. The Vikram lander is now using its onboard computers and logic to try to make a soft landing on the Moon. While mission controllers at ISTRAC will monitor it closely, the onboard systems of the lander will be doing all the heavy lifting. The Chandrayaan-3 mission is the follow-up to the Chandrayaan-2 mission of 2019, when the Vikram lander crashed into the lunar surface. The primary objective of the mission is simple – showcase the space agency’s capability to complete a soft landing on the Moon. With the mission, India has joined a small and exclusive club of countries that have managed to soft land on the Moon. So far, the club has three members – the United States, the Soviet Union and China.

General Secretary ACMOA, Dr. E.M. Jayantha Bandara addressing the media yesterday (23) urged the Treasury to release required funds for the purchase of essential drug stocks including the anaesthetic ‘Isoflurane’ which is a general anaesthetic administered by inhalation. He said the particular anaesthetic was given from a vapouriser. He said currently routine surgeries at District General Hospital Nuwara Eliya had been temporarily halted as a result due to the shortage of the anaesthetic. It has caused severe inconvenience to those who had received dates for their routine surgeries during this period. The anaesthetic inhaler is short supply in several other hospitals in the country which had prompted hospital authorities to limit routine surgeries being carried out in these hospitals. The General Secretary urged the Health Ministry to provide the essential medicinal drugs in sufficient quantities regularly rather than intermittently as was being practised at present. There should be buffer stocks of all essential drugs so as to provide continuous service, he said. Dr. Bandara urged the Health Ministry to ensure that the procedure of purchasing the drugs was carried out sans corruption.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Addressing the present situation within the OMP, a media briefing was conducted yesterday (23), and Katulanda disclosed that on their assumption of the OMP’s responsibilities, they inherited 64 individual files containing information about their disappearance. He highlighted that they have since received and compiled additional data concerning the missing individuals. Notably, over the past year and a half, they have engaged with 3,819 families of missing persons, gathering valuable insights. Moreover, the OMP has taken proactive measures by establishing supplementary mechanisms and panels to conduct thorough investigations. A total of 15 independent panels have been instituted for this purpose, Katulanda emphasised, reaffirming that these panels operate autonomously, free from any external influence, be it from the Government or any other entity. During the briefing, he underscored the distressing scenario of individuals being taken against their will and vanishing without any trace, neither a body nor any sign of their existence. This issue has garnered heightened scrutiny due to the 30 years of conflict that engulfed the Northern and Eastern regions, culminating on 18 May 2009. Post the conflict; the international community directed their attention towards Sri Lanka, prompting inquiries from entities such as the UNHRC, United Nations, the Red Cross, and the UN Council. In response, the Government introduced the 2016 Act No. 14, aiming to address these concerns. Before this, there had been around eight commissions, including the LLRC Commission and the Paranagama Commission, but their findings did not provide solace to the families of the victims. Thus, an independent institution named the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) was set up in 2018. Since its inception, the office has undergone several transitions, with personnel changes and procedural adjustments. Drawing on the expertise of various professionals, the OMP’s framework was meticulously formulated, he said. At present, the OMP represents a facet of society where individuals, particularly parents and children, who continue to endure profound sadness, have become increasingly vocal and impassioned. However, efforts are now on a constructive trajectory. The Act introduced in 2016 encompasses events spanning from the 1971 civil unrest to the violent incidents in the South in 1989 and 1983 July, collectively aimed at addressing the issue of missing persons dating back to 1968. The search for these individuals has no set endpoint, but it was after the conclusion of the conflict in 2009 that heightened attention was directed toward it. While previous efforts such as the LLRC and Paranagama Commission offered some insights, the present OMP carries more authoritative capabilities in tackling this challenge. He said, transitioning to another commission would not be viable, as the issue demands immediate attention. The goal is to expedite resolutions, although it remains uncertain if the OMP will be able to uncover all details and conclude its work by issuing death or missing certificates along with compensation. Nevertheless, the primary aspiration is to provide clarity to the families of enforced disappeared persons – explaining what transpired, who was involved, and why. Closure might be achieved if physical remains are found, however, the absence of any trace, whether indicating life or death, remains profoundly agonising for mothers, regardless of whether they belong to soldiers, LTTE members, or civilians, the Chairman pointed out.

Chaired by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the meeting brought together prominent advisers and experts to deliberate on strategies to enhance the nation’s response to climate change. During his address, President Wickremesinghe underscored the significance of resilience on both local and global scales. He emphasised the need for assertive action, both domestically and on the international front, noting the pivotal role of financial support in advancing climate initiatives. The President remarked that finance serves as the lifeblood of any endeavour and emphasised the need for Sri Lanka to bolster its capabilities on this front, as outlined in the PMD statement. The President’s call for action stemmed from his observation that while numerous climate change initiatives are proposed, insufficient attention was paid to  financing. He highlighted Sri Lanka’s expertise in international economics, particularly in climate financing associated with debt management, positioning the country in a unique position, the PMD said. President Wickremesinghe also introduced forming a National Consultative Committee that would involve both private and public sector entities. He said, “This committee should encompass relevant agencies from the public and private sectors and will comprise 100 to 150 members. Regular consultations with this committee, at least every six months, would facilitate discussions on the progress made. Establishing such a structure could yield the desired outcomes. I believe that collaboration between the Foreign Ministry and the Environment Ministry was crucial on international aspects. Further, it’s imperative that everyone contributes with a focus on international finance. We could align this effort with our Institutes of Economics and Trade, thus positioning Sri Lanka as a hub for global financial activities. Thus, we will work to consolidate this concept.” The President emphasised alignment with international agendas, including those of the UN Secretary-General and President Biden. He proposed the setting up of an International Climate Change University, serving as a global research hub and a testament to Sri Lanka’s commitment to climate change. The PMD added that Ruwan Wijewardena, Senior Adviser to the President on Climate Change, briefed the President about discussions with reputed universities, including those in the US and Cambridge regarding the setting up of the Climate Change University. The meeting unveiled key highlights for the upcoming COP28, encompassing the Climate Justice Forum, the launch of the Climate Prosperity Plan, the International Climate Change University, and the Tropical Red initiative. The significance of showcasing Sri Lanka’s practices through a dedicated platform and facilitating discussions was also stated. Ananda Mallawatantri, Adviser to the President on Environment, Climate, and Green Finance, presented a proposal to collaborate with international universities, spotlighting the agreement with Georgetown University and opportunities with Yale.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Chaos erupted in the Chamber during the Oral Questions Round, as a verbal altercation escalated among multiple MPs. During the proceedings, MP Wasantha Yapa Bandara posed a question to Wildlife Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi regarding tamed elephants. This was followed by objections raised by Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, who expressed concern over the extension of the session’s scheduled time. Subsequently, MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam directed his inquiry towards MP Nalin Bandara, involving irregularities within the district development committee and divisional development committees in Batticaloa. While Nalin Bandara was addressing Rasamanickam’s query, allegations emerged that his response was veering off topic. Nevertheless, Nalin Bandara persisted with his response despite the allegations. The situation spiralled into disarray despite the Deputy Speaker’s repeated calls for appropriate behaviour from the MPs. In light of the futile appeals, the Deputy Speaker adjourned the parliamentary session for 10 minutes. A meeting took place under the leadership of Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena and after resuming the sittings, the Speaker ordered Wasantha Yapa Bandara and Nalin Bandara to exit the Chamber for the remainder of the day’s session due to their disruptive behaviour that hindered the smooth conduct of parliamentary proceedings. After the two MPs complied and left the Chamber, normal parliamentary activities resumed under the leadership of Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

Chaired by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the meeting brought together prominent advisers and experts to deliberate on strategies to enhance the nation’s response to climate change. During his address, President Wickremesinghe underscored the significance of resilience on both local and global scales. He emphasised the need for assertive action, both domestically and on the international front, noting the pivotal role of financial support in advancing climate initiatives. The President remarked that finance serves as the lifeblood of any endeavour and emphasised the need for Sri Lanka to bolster its capabilities on this front, as outlined in the PMD statement. The President’s call for action stemmed from his observation that while numerous climate change initiatives are proposed, insufficient attention was paid to  financing. He highlighted Sri Lanka’s expertise in international economics, particularly in climate financing associated with debt management, positioning the country in a unique position, the PMD said. President Wickremesinghe also introduced forming a National Consultative Committee that would involve both private and public sector entities. He said, “This committee should encompass relevant agencies from the public and private sectors and will comprise 100 to 150 members. Regular consultations with this committee, at least every six months, would facilitate discussions on the progress made. Establishing such a structure could yield the desired outcomes. I believe that collaboration between the Foreign Ministry and the Environment Ministry was crucial on international aspects. Further, it’s imperative that everyone contributes with a focus on international finance. We could align this effort with our Institutes of Economics and Trade, thus positioning Sri Lanka as a hub for global financial activities. Thus, we will work to consolidate this concept.” The President emphasised alignment with international agendas, including those of the UN Secretary-General and President Biden. He proposed the setting up of an International Climate Change University, serving as a global research hub and a testament to Sri Lanka’s commitment to climate change. The PMD added that Ruwan Wijewardena, Senior Adviser to the President on Climate Change, briefed the President about discussions with reputed universities, including those in the US and Cambridge regarding the setting up of the Climate Change University. The meeting unveiled key highlights for the upcoming COP28, encompassing the Climate Justice Forum, the launch of the Climate Prosperity Plan, the International Climate Change University, and the Tropical Red initiative. The significance of showcasing Sri Lanka’s practices through a dedicated platform and facilitating discussions was also stated. Ananda Mallawatantri, Adviser to the President on Environment, Climate, and Green Finance, presented a proposal to collaborate with international universities, spotlighting the agreement with Georgetown University and opportunities with Yale. Plans to partner with EU institutions to exchange expertise and promote sustainable practices were also discussed.

The Bandarawela mall becomes the fifth Cargills Square to be opened by the company, and the second mall to be opened during 2023.  A beacon of confidence The Cargills Square is more than just a mall; it is a symbol of resilience and optimism in Sri Lanka’s future. Through its decision to invest in the Cargills Square in Bandarawela, Cargills has shone a light of hope for the local community as well as the country at large, creating a unique shopping and entertainment hub for families, youth, and visitors to Bandarawela. The five-storey shopping and entertainment complex includes a Cargills Food City supermarket, a Food Court with multiple restaurants, retail shops, a KFC restaurant, and two cinema screens including a 3D facility to watch the latest cinematic releases. The complex also houses a Cargills Bank branch, to provide convenient financial solutions to customers. Empowering the youth, building dreams One of the primary visions behind Cargills Square is to empower the youth and ignite their aspirations. By creating family-friendly entertainment complexes, Cargills aims to provide spaces where dreams can flourish and where the younger generation can envision a future filled with opportunities. The meticulously designed entertainment facilities, thoughtfully curated retail outlets, and vibrant atmosphere are all aimed at inspiring creativity, innovation, and personal growth among the youth of Bandarawela and beyond. Beyond urban boundaries Cargills has always been committed to the uplift of communities across Sri Lanka, contributing towards the development of rural towns and the country as a whole. While many shopping and entertainment complexes are confined to urban areas, the Cargills Square mall defies this norm. The company envisions to transcend geographical boundaries and make modern, world-class entertainment and shopping facilities inclusive for all communities across the country. The Cargills Square concept was first introduced in 2013 with the objective of providing entertainment and shopping experiences for customers in areas outside the Colombo city limits. Following the success of the first Cargills Square in Jaffna, which was the first large-scale commercial investment in the North by a blue-chip company, Cargills subsequently opened three more malls in Gampaha, Dematagoda, and Katubedda. Cultural value and history The location of the Cargills Square mall in Bandarawela, once housed the infamous Cargills department store, which dates back to the 1800s. This heritage building has been preserved and transformed by the company to suit the demands of the modern consumer while retaining its rich history. Not too far from the location lies the iconic Bandarawela Hotel – another heritage building which has history going back to the year 1893. As the Cargills Square in Bandarawela opens its doors, the company invites the community to come together and create lasting memories. Built with an investment of Rupees 1.6 billion, the project stands as a testament to the Cargills Group’s confidence in the potential of the Sri Lankan economy and its commitment to fostering hope and opportunities for the youth."

He revealed that from January of the current year until now, the exports of gems and jewellery have generated USD 315 million in revenue. Speaking at a press conference, held at the President’s Media Centre, Dasanayake said that the gem and jewellery sector has achieved remarkable export growth, contributing substantially to the nation’s foreign exchange reserves. He emphasised that this sector’s export growth rate is an impressive 34%, a statistic confirmed by reports from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). He noted the historical concerns surrounding foreign exchange remittance earned through gem exports and mentioned the establishment of a new customs clearance system, under the current Government, to address these issues. This system ensures meticulous assessment of each exported gem to facilitate the inflow of foreign exchange, he said. In the past, the country’s gems were auctioned abroad without receiving equitable remuneration. To counter this, Dasanayake expressed the Government’s strategic efforts to maximise profits from gem and jewellery exports, which have seen a substantial boost. He also highlighted the NGJA’s effective communication with exporters to address challenges and ensure smooth operations. In the previous year, the authority’s revenue from licensing and assessment fees was Rs 144 million. However, in the current year alone, it has achieved a significant profit of Rs 288 million. The State Minister emphasised that strategies are in place to further increase the authority’s profits by an impressive 200% by the end of the year. Dasanayake underscored that the Ministry of Primary Industries has been instrumental in alleviating foreign exchange scarcity and the NGJA is a notable contributer to the nation’s economic well-being.

He issued a stern warning that if this trend persists, it could lead to the deterioration of the country’s education system. Gajadeera alleged that more than 10,000 students who sat the G.C.E. Advanced Level examination in 2018 and 2019 have been left in limbo, unable to secure admission to teacher training schools. He accused the Education Ministry of lacking a viable plan to integrate these young individuals into teacher training programmes.

The CM Port also runs the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) and the State Minster alleged that the transaction was facilitated by a Chinese business figure, who secured the land at a seemingly low cost to construct the mega logistic centre.  Expressing concerns over the leasing of the land, the State Minister warned that this development poses a potential threat to national security and expressed worries that the revenue generated from the Port’s operations over the next 35 years would be diverted to the Chinese operators of the facility. The construction work on the logistic centre has not commenced as yet according to sources. He claimed that the land was undervalued, because land evaluation was not carried out by the State, but by a private party who undervalued the 13-acre plot at a time when there is a high demand for land inside the Port. He said he would expose the matter at the next press conference and that he, as the State Minister who is aware of corruption, was in the process of gathering inside information to bring it to the notice of the authorities. He claimed that he has been sidelined without any job given to him and he merely signs documents of requests for jobs and opportunities which are then forwarded to Minister de Silva. He said the 13 acres, located between the East Container Terminal and the West Container Terminal, has been given to the Chinese for a song. Further, he alleged that certain senior officials were reportedly involved in rampant corruption at the Ports ministry. Notably, the land that was leased for 35 years sans a tender process, proper procurement procedures, or a thorough evaluation was a serious matter of concern.  The State Minister said however, the striking paradox is where some trade unions, typically vocal about corruption and the sale of national assets, have remained silent regarding this issue.  Further, Jayasekara alleged that there had been proposals concerning the usage of this land since 2016. However, the leasing took place without transparent processes before it was given to China, he claimed. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The PSM, comprising professional associations of radiologists, laboratory scientists, pharmacologists, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists would stage the strike from 8.00 a.m. on 24 August 2023. Outlining their demands Dharmawickrema said they also comprised demands for the issuance of a circular related to grade promotions, leaving room for a collapse in services by putting a stop to new recruitments to the PSM categories and against the suppressing of trade union leaders and their members by issuing unfairly disciplinary orders. He warned that the strike would result in the breakdown in radiological tests, CT, MRI tests, all laboratory tests, issuance of medicinal drugs, collapse in the physiotherapist, and occupational therapists services. However the ‘Apeksha’ Hospital for patients with cancer, maternal and child hospitals and the National Blood Centre would be exempted from the strike. Apart from this, all emergencies and life saving services would be maintained. But should there be attempts to intimidate and obstruct the services of PSM engaged in voluntary services, measures would be taken to remove them from duty as well, he warned.  Meanwhile, the President of the JCPSM Ravi Kumudesh, in a letter to the Health Secretary, noted that the JCPSM was forced to resort to trade union action against  barriers that had been set up from within the Ministry in making timely changes. In a letter copied to the Health Minister, all Provincial Health Secretaries, Additional Secretaries (Administration I and II), Director General Health Services and heads of all State health institutions, he noted that although the PSM had patiently tried to resolve the issues that were affecting them, the professional hypocrisy of other services and the highhandedness of some health officials had placed an obstruction to making those changes a reality.

Dissanayake raised a question, under Standing Orders, expressing concern over the leasing of Channel Eye to the SDT Channel of Lyca Mobile, alleging that proper procedure was not followed. “You (Gunawardena) are trying to gain approval to hide the alleged fraudulent action. It is reported that the estimated monthly income was Rs 25 million and whether the Channel Eye Board of Directors had the authority to lease air time to a company without proper procedure was of concern. What is the basis for this?” he queried. Gunawardena: “Channel Eye was not leased but rented to VIS Broadcasting Company for six months at a monthly rate of Rs 25 million. What you say is incorrect.” Dissanayake: “You say that. But I can show you the Cabinet Paper that mentioned the lease for six months.” In response, Minister Gunawardane claimed he did not draft the Cabinet Paper and that the term ‘lease out’ was mistakenly used instead of ‘rent out’ by the Cabinet Secretary. “I will resign from all positions and politics if any wrongdoing in the transaction could be proved,” Gunawardena said.

Premadasa, speaking in Parliament yesterday (22), highlighted that numerous districts across the nation were grappling with severe water scarcity. “This shortage is affecting not only drinking water for people but also water availability for livestock, agriculture, and power generation. Wildlife is also facing challenges due to inadequate drinking water, while the drying grasslands have caused several crises, making this a matter of national significance,” he said. He emphasised the necessity for a comprehensive programme to assist those impacted by crop damage, extending beyond the coverage provided by the existing crop insurance scheme. If funding was insufficient for such an initiative, he pointed out that during the period from 14 October 2020, to 20 February 2021, the special commodity tax on sugar imports was reduced from Rs 50 to 25 cents. Premadasa recommended that these monies should be recovered and channelled to support farmers affected by crop loss. Referring to the import of 400,000 MT of sesame and the resulting loss of Rs 15.9 billion to the country, Premadasa called for the individuals responsible for this wrongdoing to be held accountable. He stressed that the recovered funds should then be directed to aid farmers who suffered losses due to the dry weather conditions. Additionally, Premadasa underscored the need for greater awareness among some ministers in parliament concerning water allocation priorities. He urged Parliament to be better informed in this regard. Furthermore, he highlighted the problems surrounding the guaranteed price for paddy given to farmers, emphasising that the current rate of Rs 80 to Rs 85 per kilo was insufficient to cover their expenses.

They successfully brought together environmental security stakeholders from across the Asia-Pacific region. The IPESF Forum saw the participation of 28 different countries. The main focus of the event was collaborative problem-solving, revolving around the theme of ‘Environmental Resilience through Cooperation’. During the forum, attention was drawn to the joint dedication of the United States and Sri Lanka towards strengthening resilient communities, safeguarding natural resources and establishing a secure Indo-Pacific region. The event covered critical topics such as climate security, maintaining sustainable resource practices, fostering multilateral cooperation and driving transformations in environmental security. United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, shared in her opening remarks: “Our vision of the world is one where all countries, big and small, have opportunities for success and stability.  Whether you’re sitting in Fiji or Australia or Mongolia or Sri Lanka, we are all vulnerable. We are seeing this year record-setting weather extremes hitting countries around the world, where everyone is feeling that impact.  Recent droughts here in Sri Lanka are impacting food security. It is imperative that we come together to share knowledge and find creative ways to address these common challenges.” Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, said on Monday: “No matter the advances we make and achieve through technology and innovation, it’s more than evident that nature is always ahead with her unique surprises, and man needs to be more circumspect. Hence, as cognitive beings we need to pursue a path of rationale behaviour forging a relationship that would ensure the sustainment of our civilization and the environment alike.” Throughout the four-day event, participants engaged in presentations, panel discussions, and interactive group activities, fostering an environment of knowledge sharing and best practice dissemination covering subjects such as climate change, land security, maritime and water security, and urbanization’s security effects. By embracing a holistic approach to environmental security, the IPESF facilitated the development of actionable plans to address pressing environmental challenges. Project development and workgroup development workshops were instrumental in generating strategies to enhance environmental resilience and security across the region. The Indo-Pacific Environmental Security Forum (IPESF), launched in 2010 by USINDOPACOM, is an annual event focused on fostering regional cooperation, knowledge sharing, and collaborative action to address environmental challenges that impact national and regional security.

By Monday (21) afternoon, a substantial portion of forest had been completely reduced to ashes due to the ongoing fire, as reported by local residents. Given the prevailing dry weather conditions, the water levels in the Moragahakanda Reservoir have significantly decreased in recent days. Consequently, many islands within the reservoir have already fallen victim to fires caused by human activities, according to statements from local residents. The fire initially ignited near the Moragahakanda Reservoir viewing centre. Vendors operating in the vicinity mentioned that they were unable to identify the originator of the fire. Remarkably, there was no sign of fire until the afternoon of Sunday (20). In recent times, students and various visitors have been flocking to the area to witness the beauty of the Moragahakanda Reservoir. These visitors have expressed their astonishment and disappointment upon witnessing the ongoing fire. The Department of Forest Conservation and the Mahaweli Authority established this protected forest with the intention of safeguarding the native trees and endemic wildlife in the region. These natural resources were impacted by the creation of the Moragahakanda Reservoir, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka. However, there appears to be a lack of effective protection for this area. Local residents have reported that the fire continues to spread, resulting in the death of numerous wild animals and the destruction of valuable trees by the morning of Monday (21). Surprisingly, neither the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority nor any other responsible agency had taken action to control the fire by that time. Instead, a foreigner from a nearby workshop and their private security officer were observed present at the scene.

He alleged that the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) stands as one of the most corrupt institutions in the country. Eleven months ago, Jayasekara was appointed to enable revenue generation. However, he lamented that he has been restricted from executing his duties and pursuing his goals. Jayasekara, who convened a media conference yesterday, said his current situation, as the State Minister, meant that he was jobless and unable to fulfil his role. He claimed that he communicated these concerns to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. “While recognising the challenge of shifting Ministries amidst the current circumstances, the President said if he (Jayasekara) were to switch, others would also demand similar changes,” Jayasekera said adding “I waited for so long and my Ministry, located in the World Trade Centre, has an outstanding rental due of eight million rupees and this expenditure  cannot continue, utilising public funds to pay for unused space. I asked the ministry to be housed within the ports authority but that has not been approved.” He alleged that corruption within the SLPA, was far worse than that in the aviation sector. He claimed that he is making this statement with a sense of responsibility. He said the people of his electorate are inquiring about the promised job opportunities and facilities. His capacity to function effectively in such a scenario has been questioned. “All the institutions under my purview are managed by the Cabinet Minister of Ports and Shipping. While I have secured one director-level appointment related to aviation, all other appointments, including directors and general managers, were made by the Minister. This dynamic has created a closed circle of like-minded individuals who operate collectively and withhold information from outsiders,” Jayasekara stressed. Speaking further, the State Minister claimed that the financial details of various projects remain undisclosed to him, with only the Minister of Ports and Aviation being privy to such information. He charged that through this practice they were hiding the truth from the public. In a stern warning, State Minister Jayasekara said he would expose corruption in the Port with documentary evidence at the next press conference, if he continues to be impeded in his role. He threatened to resign and said he intends to reveal corruption even if his duties were reinstated, as he could no longer tolerate the current state of affairs.  “Given that we (the Cabinet Minister and State Minister) cannot work in isolation, as a State Minister, I have put forth numerous proposals and brought in potential investors to start the development of ports like Oluvil and KKS. However, these efforts have encountered numerous barriers and obstacles. Despite being responsible for these institutions, officials within the Ministry have blocked our work.  These officials only operate on the instructions of the  Minister,” he said. He said there was no animosity between him and the Minister, but that when  proposals and investers were presented, progress was obstructed. He pointed out that for the KKS project, they had introduced an invester of Sri Lankan origin from France. However, the proposal was rejected solely because the invester was associated with the State Ministry. Consequently, the invester returned to his country after realising he couldn’t proceed, Jayasekara claimed. “While the Port Minister publicly announced the country’s openness to business and ferry services, he is, in fact, the person who has prevented such initiatives.  There are senior officials who remain entrenched in their positions for 15 to 20 years without any rotations of duties. These individuals, including accountants and other senior figures, hold the reins and contribute to corruption. They have formed a cohesive group,” he alleged. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Deen, strongly condemned the violent attacks that transpired on 16 August 2023, targeting the Pakistani Christian community in Jaranwala within the Faisalabad District. In her statement, she emphasised, “We vehemently urge authorities to prioritise the safety of minority group members and uphold the fundamental principles of freedom of religion or belief for all. The senseless acts of violence, including the desecration of over 25 churches, the burning of Bibles, and the destruction of fellow Christians’ homes, are nothing short of tragic and deplorable.” She further asserted that such actions only serve to breed more resentment and hatred, leading to far-reaching consequences that undermine coexistence, harmony, and solidarity among people. Notably, with a significant quarter of the global population residing in South Asia — encompassing Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka — it is distressing that religious minorities across this region continue to endure substantial violence and discrimination. “The unfolding events in Pakistan serve as a sobering reminder for us to introspect on our treatment of minorities. The International Religious Freedom (IRF) Roundtable provides a safe space where individuals, NGOs, and government officials from diverse faith backgrounds collaborate to champion global freedom of religion or belief.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

This initiative has been set in motion following instructions of Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva. The effort aligns with the Government’s decision to direct the youth of Sri Lanka towards the burgeoning employment prospects within the swiftly advancing port and maritime sectors, driven by modern technology. Established in 1987 by the late Minister Lalith Athulathmudali, who served as the Minister of Ports and Shipping, the Mahapola Ports and Maritime Academy has evolved into a globally recognised institution for higher education under SLPA. Over the years, the institution has been dedicated to imparting knowledge to both port employees and young Sri Lankan students pursuing advanced education in navigation, port operations, and the maritime sector. The aim is to attract and enroll a larger number of young individuals into these programmes, providing them with the essential infrastructure and resources. The Minister has granted approval to recruit qualified professionals to deliver these courses effectively. Presently, the academy awards around 2,000 diplomas annually, and the Minister intends to elevate this number by introducing fresh programmes and enhancing the existing ones. On 22 August 2023, a special discussion concerning the implementation of these initiatives took place at the MPMA, initiated by the Minister. Furthermore, the Minister conducted an inspection of the areas where modern infrastructure is to be installed and developed within the institution. SLPA’s Vice Chairman Gayan Algewattege, Managing Director Prabath Jayantha Malavige, Chief Training Manager of MPMA Nirmal de Fonseka, and several other senior officials were present."

According to the sources at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, these deaths have been caused by a bacteria named Meningococcal. Additional Commissioner General of Prisons and Prisons Spokesperson Chandana Ekanayake said that one inmate died yesterday (21) and another on the day before (20). Following an open verdict regarding those deaths, the body parts of the deceased have been forwarded to the Government Analyst for further tests, he added. Ekanayake also said that five inmates, who contracted fever, are being treated at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital and 10 others at the Galle Prison Hospital. Ekanayake further mentioned that in order to prevent the spread of fever, masks have been given to all the inmates and that if an emergency situation arises, a decision will be taken to close the prison. Meningococcal disease refers to any illness caused by bacteria called Neisseria meningitides. These illnesses are often severe, can be deadly and include infections of the lining of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) and bloodstream. Keeping up to date with recommended vaccines is the best protection against meningococcal disease, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA. The doctors and other health personnel at the hospitals have been advised to wear face masks when treating patients with such symptoms. Director of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital Dr. Udesh Ranga, said that several patients who were brought from the prison in the last few days were admitted to the hospital and two of them have died. He said, further details about these deaths can be given following the final reports. However, an internal message issued to the doctors of the KarapitiyaTeaching Hospital states that the cause of death of the two persons was meningococcal bacteria.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The last leg of the 14-day march commenced from the historic Nalanda GedigeVihara in Matale. At least, 3,000 people joined the march on the final day including Malaiyaha community members, clergy from all religious faiths, students, civil society representatives, and well-wishers. While the march concluded at the Sri Muthumariamman Temple in Matale, 70 persons who had walked the entire journey from Talaimannar to Matale were recognised and honoured for their effort. Speaking to Ceylon Today, human rights activist and an organiser of the walk, Jeevaratnam Suresh said his community should be officially recognised as ‘Malaiyaha Tamils’ instead of the commonly used term ‘Indian Tamil’. s “For the past 200 years, our community has been the largest contributor to Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange earnings. However, our identity is yet to be officially recognised. We are not seeking sympathy; we are striving for acceptance and the acknowledgement of our rights. This march marks just the initial step. Let’s come together to address these crucial matters and find the rightful place we deserve. After two centuries, we are eagerly awaiting the resolution of these issues at the earliest.” he said. Meanwhile, addressing the media, Wekandawala Rahula Thera emphasised the need for unity to restore the rightful pride and identity of the Malaiyaha Tamil community. “As religious leaders, it is our duty to honour the dignity and identity of every citizen. We must strive to uphold the vision they rightfully deserve. Our faith teaches us to refrain from discrimination. The community in question has been seeking recognition for their identity for many years, and it’s important that they receive the respectful responses they deserve,” Thera noted. “It is truly impactful to witness the Sri Lankan Malaiyaha Tamil community connecting with their heritage, thereby empowering themselves through this march. This effort has facilitated a broader societal conversation about the dignity of individuals and their rights as equal citizens of our nation.” SuchithAbeywikrama, an activist said. “Being part of this solidarity was crucial for me, as the Sri Lanka I desire is one where fairness prevails for everyone. It’s about standing alongside others and voicing their concerns. Additionally, as a Buddhist, I firmly believe that my practice involves striving for the overall welfare of all individuals and contributing to the healing of our fractured society. I’m convinced that it’s high time we acknowledge the challenges faced by the Malaiyaha Tamil community and focus on the essential social, economic, and political changes required for our coexistence,” he added. US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, also conveyed her commendations for the event via her official Twitter account. She remarked, “With the completion of the 2-week walk commemorating the Malaiyaha Tamils’ struggle to become full and equal citizens with other communities, our thoughts are with those who marched from Talaimannar to Matale to mark the anniversary of their arrival in Sri Lanka’s hill country plantations 200 years ago”. Representing 11 Tamil schools within the Matale district, the students of these schools coordinated a procession in Matale city, which featured various Tamil cultural activities. Furthermore, 25 students from the Kandaloya Estate in the Kagalle district, who were selected for university education, also participated in this march. Remarkably, all these students are enrolled in different universities across Sri Lanka, having received their primary education in the schools of the Yatiyanthota area. The Malaiyaha Tamils encounter significant hardships stemming from their lack of land ownership. This predicament greatly complicates their ability to sustain themselves, often leading them to reside in low-income housing or on the outskirts of urban areas, where they grapple with various challenges. These difficulties extend to their children, who attend segregated, lower-tier schools, consequently hindering their access to promising career prospects and a pathway to socioeconomic advancement. Regrettably, this pattern of inequitable treatment reverberates into their professional lives as well, as they confront obstacles in securing employment opportunities and face wage disparities. Moreover, their underrepresentation within the government further exacerbates the injustices they experience. The challenges faced by this community serve as a poignant reminder of the imperative to champion equity and impartiality for all individuals. It is incumbent upon both the Sri Lankan Government and the international community to rally behind them, safeguarding the integrity of their rights. Although the recent protest marked a promising commencement, their quest for parity persists. With an enhanced network of support, they exhibit a resolute spirit, showcasing their unwavering resolve to the world. On the final day of the march, the Malaiyaha Tamils, adorned in the attire of tea plantation workers, covered a distance of 26 km. This symbolic act was carried out to advocate for the fundamental livelihood rights of their communities. Commenting on the march, a Professor from the Department of Economics and Statistics of the University of Peradeniya Dr. Kalpa Rajapaksha said the feat was historical. “This struggle, epitomised by the recent march, has brought to light various dimensions of the labour force within the estate sector. The participants of the march notably rejected the label ‘Estate Tamil’ and instead embraced the identity of Malaiyaha Tamil, signifying Tamils from the upcountry,” he said. According to Rajapaksha, this shift holds profound significance as it involves replacing a label imposed by capitalist norms with a name that resonates with their own history and identity. “This act holds historical importance as it signifies their refusal to adopt a name bestowed upon them by a system that historically oppressed, marginalised, and ruthlessly exploited them. This transformation holds immense meaning not only for the individuals involved but also for the broader society,” he noted. Rajapaksha commended the dedication of those who walked the entire trek from Talaimannar to Matale. “Certain individuals from this community, although born in the upcountry, ventured to various regions across Sri Lanka for work. However, regardless of their location, they remained subject to harsh exploitation by both the capitalist framework and the majority Sinhalese population, along with other communities. The level of commitment demonstrated by these individuals throughout the march carries profound meaning. It underscores their resilience in the face of adversity and sheds light on the depth of their dedication to their cause,” he said. He also recognised the communal harmony and cooperation displayed by those of other communities along the way. “It’s heartening to note that the Sinhalese community also played a supportive role during the march, offering sustenance such as food and drinks, and displaying a remarkable sense of hospitality. Equally noteworthy is the strategic approach of the march participants in conveying their message to others. Even in the midst of accepting food and engaging in conversations, they exhibited careful consideration and strategy to effectively communicate the essence of their cause. This collaboration between communities holds significant importance, particularly given Sri Lanka’s current socio-political context that necessitates such forms of communication and cooperation. In such circumstances, these efforts are not only valuable but essential for fostering understanding and unity,” he said. “Engaging in direct, face-to-face conversations with people is essential. The era of virtual communication and social media has its boundaries, particularly when it comes to driving substantial political change. To witness transformative shifts in Sri Lanka’s political landscape, prioritising human-to-human interaction, building connections, and offering political education becomes imperative,” Rajapaksha concluded.

According to the environmentalists, the toxic effluents are released into a highly environmentally sensitive Vidathalthivu lagoon leading to the contamination of the nearby sea waters. The shrimp farm operates 10 metres away from the other side of the A 32, on the road between the Vidathalthivu sanctuary and the shrimp farm. Vidathalthivu is the third largest marine protected area which was declared as a nature reserve by Gazette No 1956/13 on 1 March 2016, and covers 29,000 hectares. “The consequences of this pollution have been dire, with reports of small fish, and vegetation dead or dying in the affected area and seriously threatening the life and lifestyles of the Vidathalthivu community, who have lived there for generations,” says chair Friends of the Earth International and Senior Adviser Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) Hemantha Withanage. He says the flora and the fauna of the protected sanctuary are affected and there is a catastrophic impact on the marine ecosystem. “The wastewater from the private shrimp farm has been observed to be black in colour, indicating the potential presence of harmful pollutants and contaminants. The impact of this pollution on marine life and water quality must be thoroughly studied,” Withanage explained. He says this situation requires immediate attention to assess the damage and immediate corrective action taken. “According to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act, No. 02 of 1996 Section No. 2 “no person shall discharge industrial or domestic effluent directly or indirectly to Sri Lanka Waters,” Withanage said.

He advocated the initiation of new irrigation projects to harness the potential of water resources that currently flow into the sea. “SJB is poised to offer its expertise and collaboration to the government, provided the government demonstrates genuine intent.” Premadasa stressed their readiness to support the government’s efforts in implementing a holistic national plan to address the nation’s pressing challenges. However, he urged the government to abstain from engaging in political manoeuvres. It was emphasised by Premadasa that the SJB’s support would not be extended if the government continues to prioritise political games and the pursuit of ministerial positions over the welfare of the nation.

Organised by NextGenSL, a cross-party youth political platform, the forum provided a stage for influential voices from both government and opposition ranks to present their perspectives on the nation’s tax framework and its way forward. Central to the discussion was the elucidation of guiding principles for a nation’s tax system. The cardinal principles underscored were impartiality, fairness, simplicity, and consistency. Notable speakers such as State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe, former State Finance Minister and SJB MP Eran Wickremaratne, Prof. Anil Jayantha from the NPP, and Duminda Hulangamuwa, Chair of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, unanimously emphasised avoiding the manipulation of taxes for bias or retaliation. A key takeaway from the event was the assertion that taxes should not be exploited or wielded to target specific individuals or groups. Instead, a foundation of integrity and transparency should underpin the tax structure. The speakers flagged the perils of using taxes as tools for personal gain or political vendettas, underscoring the importance of upholding the credibility of the tax system. Impartiality, another pivotal principle, was highlighted as paramount in establishing a tax structure that treats all entities equally, eradicating potential favoritism or undue influence. A neutral tax set-up guarantees uniform application of rules and regulations to everyone, forestalling any potential discrimination. Further, simplicity and stability were touted as indispensable components of an efficient tax framework. A simplified tax architecture diminishes intricacies, aiding businesses and individuals in grasping and adhering to tax regulations. Steadfast tax policies provide assurance and assurance for long-term planning, kindling investments and development. The speakers echoed that these foundational principles should constitute the bedrock of any tax strategy. By upholding impartiality, fairness, simplicity, and stability, nations can cultivate a tax structure that spurs economic progress, incentivizes investments, and nurtures an equitable and transparent ecosystem for all taxpayers. State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe underscored the need to consistently enact reforms within the IMF programme’s framework. He stressed that adherence to the programme could forestall the necessity for another IMF programme to stabilise the economy. Semasinghe also discussed the urgency of a centralised revenue body and a digitised system to enhance tax collection and transparency in tax administration. He also acknowledged the significance of tackling corruption and affirmed the government’s resolve to enforce newanti-corruption laws effectively. Duminda Hulangamuwa, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chair, voiced concerns about elevated tax levels in the nation. He contended that prevailing tax rates, particularly income tax, are burdensome, given Sri Lanka’s history of a low-tax culture. Hulangamuwa stressed that economic expansion is imperative to bolster revenue, rather than further tax hikes. He also tackled government expenditure, suggesting exploring options for interest relief to alleviate the load. Eran Wickremaratne proposed a tax policy committee to facilitate discussions between experts and politicians for informed tax decisions. He also advocated for a single tax collection authority to streamline revenue collection. Wickremaratne acknowledged the political complexities associated with these ideas but emphasised the necessity of radical action to plug revenue leakage. He cited instances of other nations successfully implementing like measures. Prof. Anil Jayantha voiced concerns about the disproportionate burden of indirect taxes on low-income individuals due to disparities in tax evasion. He stressed the need to root out leakages in the tax system to bolster the tax-to-GDP ratio. Prof. Jayantha also highlighted the significance of maintaining a consistent primary balance in Sri Lanka’s economy, mitigating fluctuations. Altogether, the forum’s speakers presented diverse viewpoints on tax policy, revenue collection, corruption, and government expenditure. These deliberations aim to illuminate the obstacles and possibilities that Sri Lanka confronts in unlocking taxes’ complete potential for economic growth and stability."

He highlighted that the tourism industry stands as the paramount sector capable of swiftly advancing the country’s economic objectives. The Government, under his leadership, has implemented numerous pivotal measures to foster its growth, the PMD said. The President emphasised the significance of substantial contributions from both the public and private sectors. He stressed that the Government is diligently working to provide necessary amenities for all stakeholders involved. Addressing the audience at the inauguration of the Hilton Yala Resort, a luxurious establishment within the Hilton Hotel Group, the President underscored the urgent need for comprehensive development in the region. The Yala National Park, frequented by local and international tourists daily, was singled out as a key area for such development. He expressed his satisfaction in inaugurating the upscale Hilton hotel in the Yala region. He noted that this move would attract energetic tourists and invigorate the tourism sector. He extended his gratitude to Melwa and the Hilton Group for their contributions. Recalling the historical significance of the area, President Wickremesinghe alluded to the ancient shrines of Situlpawwa and Akasa Chaitya that once graced Yala. He praised the past fertility and collaboration that defined the area, as well as its remarkable architectural marvels. The President emphasised a resolute commitment to advancing the tourism industry, urging collective participation towards this goal. He envisioned the development of the Yala area as a unified tourist destination, incorporating nearby areas like Udawalawe. This interconnected approach, he suggested, would drive progress and further enhance the tourism experience in the region. “Furthermore, there is a pressing need to enhance the facilities catering to tourists visiting these regions. I kindly urge both the Minister of Wildlife and Forest Conservation and the Minister of Tourism, along with their respective Ministry officials, to collaborate on devising a comprehensive development plan for the Yala area. “This expansion should extend to encompass locales like Galoya, Maduruoya, Somavatiya, Minneriya and Wasgamuwa.” “The industry has to be involvedand that is a prerequisite. I have been also looking at this hotel and the areaand I thought we should also promote Yala. We will introduce the greater Yala. “Why are you going to call these places Udawalawe, Kumana and all? These are all connected, and the elephant path passage from Udawalawe will take you up to Kumana. So, let’s brand this as Greater Yala and make it Greater Yala for all promotional activities. “So, why only have luxury hotels here? You can have some near, I am sure, just outside Kumana before Arugambay and we can find some land for another set. Somewhere in Udawalawe, somewhere in Lunugamwehera, where those who want to can also access theKataragama shrines. “So, these are places. Why don’t we develop them? I am asking the Minister, together with the Minister of Wildlife and Conservation, as well as the officials of those two ministries, to come up with the Greater Yala concept. I don’t think we should stop there. If you take GalOya, MaduruOya, Somavathiya, Minneriya, and Wasgamuwa, you will have a unique brand. So, just have two brands and Wilpattu, which can stand on its own. And certainly, why don’t you get into a yacht in Colombo, come to Puttlam Bay, spend a day or two at Wilpattu and get back? So, you will have some wildlife reserves, which will be different from what you can get in other places. “Additionally, an intriguing prospect lies in establishing wildlife reserves that offer visitors a fresh and unique experience, reminiscent of the offerings in countries like India and Nepal. This avenue warrants significant attention as we formulate a new strategy to elevate the tourism industry. “It is essential that we set ambitious targets for the tourism sector, with the goal of doubling the influx of tourists to our country. Correspondingly, the revenue generated from tourism should witness a four to fivefold increase. “Reflecting on my visit to the Maldives in 1981, I recall that their tourist income amounted to USD 25. Interestingly, at that time, fewer tourists visited the Maldives compared to our nation. Today, the number of tourists arriving here, approximately 2.5 million, equals the visitors to the Maldives. “Presently, we charge around USD 200 per tourist, while the Maldives charges approximately USD700. Therefore, to invigorate the tourism industry, we must not only boost the number of tourists but also consider elevating the pricing. “Upon assuming the presidency, my responsibility extended beyond liberating the country from debt burdens. I was tasked with devising innovative avenues to generate income. Unlike industries and agriculture, which require time to yield returns, the tourism sector presents an avenue for swift contributions. “Hence, our primary objective revolves around promoting tourism to generate income and fulfil the needs of our people. As the year concludes, our hotels will brim with tourists—a trend that’s already underway. Looking ahead to the following year, we must not only fill our rooms with tourists but also double the resultant income. “Tourist accommodations across the nation are experiencing high occupancy rates in September, buoyed by the historic Dalada Perehara and the Asia Cup cricket tournament in Kandy. The upcoming Christmas season is anticipated to draw several internationally renowned artists and musicians, including the distinguished Western musician Andrey Mucher, who is slated to grace our shores in January. “The country hosts a myriad of events, such as the Galle Literary Festival, strategically designed to attract more visitors and generate vital revenue for the nation. Simultaneously, this endeavour should serve as a means of both income and employment, necessitating comprehensive training for the youth. In certain instances, this avenue has evolved into a gateway to international employment, highlighting the importance of collective engagement in shaping both individual futures and broader initiatives. “Numerous innovative proposals have been introduced to expedite the progress of our tourism sector. Notably, the government is working to extend support for individuals willing to allocate two rooms in their homes for tourists, providing excellent guest services while commanding rates upwards of a hundred dollars. “The imperative of achieving our tourism industry’s objectives is paramount. We aim to harness resources to swiftly generate income and employment prospects. In this pursuit, I appeal for the unwavering support of all individuals.” Meanwhile, President Wickremesinghe embarked on an inspection tour of the Yala National Park. During the visit, he highlighted the option of purchasing park tickets online for both local and foreign visitors. Acknowledging the arid climate, the President also observed efforts to rejuvenate dried-up water ponds within the park. Accompanying him were Minister Harin Fernando and American Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung. Also present were Jamie Mead, Senior Operations Director (South East Asia) of the Hilton Hotels Group, Josh Roberts, Senior Operations Director (Asia & Australasia), Sri Lanka Hilton Hotels Group Regional General Manager Manesh Fernando, Hilton Yala Resort General Manager GitanjaliChakravarthy, MurugaPillai, Director of Melwa Hotels & Resorts Private Limited, and several other officials."

According to unofficial reports, Ganemulle Sanjeeva, an accused in numerous contracted murders had fled to India while on bail and was apparently taken into custody while trying to cross the border into Nepal. Meanwhile, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is in touch with foreign security agencies on the alleged arrests and was not in a position to completely confirm the arrests by last night. Ganemulle Sanjeeva was also known as Makilangamuwe Sanjeeva for some time. Sanjeeva, was arrested by the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) for attacking a Black Maria, when Dematagoda Chaminda, a suspect in the murder of Bharata Lakshman Premachandra, was being taken to Court in Hulftsdorp. He was allowed  bail after spending a long time in remand. The Colombo Chief Magistrate had ordered the release of 11 suspects, including ‘Ganemulla Sanjeewa’ from an arms trafficking case. The case was filed against 15 suspects for secretly transporting weapons including Claymore Bombs and T-56 firearms that were buried in the North-Eastern parts of the country, by the LTTE during the civil war period, to Colombo and other urban areas. The charges included the sale and purchase of such weapons to underworld gang members. By Keerthi Mendis"

The report was called for by the Minister from the Department of Agriculture. The Minister pointed out that onion cultivation in Sri Lanka has failed during the past few years though it had been a success for a long time. According to the Agriculture Ministry, the annual requirement of onions is 300,000 MT but Sri Lanka’s annual import of onions has been 131,795 MT per year. Meanwhile, Indian Media stated that India will impose, with immediate effect, a 40% export duty on onions. The tax imposition will be in place up to 31 December in an attempt to improve domestic availability of the vegetable, the Ministry of Finance said in a notification on Saturday. The duty imposed by the world’s biggest exporter of onions will help New Delhi dampen local prices ahead of key State elections later this year, but will force Asian buyers to shell out more, as other regional exporters have limited supplies. India is heading for its driest August in more than a century, with scant rainfall likely to persist across large areas, partly because of the El Niño weather pattern, pointed out two agency reports while quoting weather department officials."

It was Russia’s first Moon mission in almost 50 years. The craft was due to be the first-ever to land on the Moon’s south pole, but failed after encountering problems as it moved into its pre-landing orbit. It was set to explore a part of the Moon which scientists think could hold frozen water and precious elements. Roscosmos, Russia’s State space corporation, said on Sunday morning that it had lost contact with the Luna-25 shortly after 14:57pm (11:57 GMT) on Saturday. Preliminary findings showed that the 800kg lander had “ceased to exist as a result of a collision with the surface of the Moon”, it said in a statement. It said a special commission would look into why the mission failed. The loss of Luna-25 is a blow to Roscosmos. Russia’s civilian space programme has been in decline for several years, as state funding is increasingly directed towards the military. Russia was racing to the Moon’s South Pole against India, whose Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft is scheduled to land there in the coming days and send a rover to explore the rocks and craters, gathering data and images to send back to Earth. Parts of the Moon’s South Pole remain permanently in shadow, which makes finding water a possibility. A spokesperson for the Indian space agency Isro described the Luna-25 crash as “unfortunate”. “Every space mission is very risky and highly technical. It’s unfortunate that Luna-25 has crashed,” they told the BBC. Roscosmos had acknowledged that the Luna-25 mission was risky and could fail. The craft launched from Vostochny Cosmodrome in the far eastern Amur region of Russia on 11 August, and then successfully entered the moon’s orbit on Wednesday of this week. It was expected to make history by making a soft landing on Monday or Tuesday, just days before the Indian touchdown. No country has ever landed on the Moon’s South Pole before, although both the US and China have landed softly on the Moon’s surface. Luna-25 was Russia’s first Moon mission since 1976, when it was part of the Soviet Union. That mission, Luna-24, landed successfully. (BBC)"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/21/comprehensive-review-of-national-security-needed-president/,Comprehensive review of national security needed – President,Author not found,0,2023-08-20T20:33:00+00:00,"President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently emphasised the critical need for a comprehensive review of the country’s national security strategy. This review will encompass a broad range of factors, including emerging economic trends and the impacts of climate change. To facilitate this review, a specialist team has been appointed. The team’s mandate is to thoroughly assess the nation’s security landscape and propose modern security policies to the National Security Council. During his address, at the Presidential Colours Awarding Ceremony at the Navy Volunteer Force Advanced Naval Training Centre in Boossa, President Wickremesinghe articulated the forthcoming evaluation of the nation’s overarching national security strategy. He underscored that this comprehensive review would encompass a broad spectrum of factors, including emerging economic paradigms and the implications of climate change. Highlighting the gravity of the matter, President Wickremesinghe revealed the appointment of a dedicated team, led by Major General Channa Gunathilaka (Rtd), to spearhead this endeavour. Once the team submits its findings, the President affirmed his commitment to subsequently formulate contemporary security policies under the purview of the National Security Council. President Wickremesinghe, in his supplementary remarks, further elaborated on the historical context of the Navy’s origins. He acknowledged that prior to gaining independence, the Navy operated as a voluntary wing of the Royal Army. Notably, during the tumultuous period of the Second World War, the responsibility of safeguarding the pivotal Colombo port was entrusted to the Navy. In the post-independence era, a permanent Naval force was duly established. The President underscored the significance of this occasion, wherein the new recruits join the ranks of a distinguished military lineage. In his address, the President said: “Today marks your entry into the esteemed ranks of the Navy. When the Sri Lanka Navy was first established, maritime threats were virtually non-existent. The Indian Ocean was under the firm control of the British Navy during that era, and subsequent to their departure, our region remained relatively tranquil. However, the landscape shifted dramatically in 1983 when we were confronted with the exigencies of conflict. On that pivotal day, the LTTE organisation showcased its adeptness in naval operations, underscoring their familiarity with the sea. This was a novel experience for our forces, compelling us to undertake a profound study of maritime strategies. Over time, through the unwavering commitment and skilfulness of our security forces, we triumphed over this adversarial entity. This victory resonated on an international scale, highlighting the capabilities of our Navy in combat scenarios. “Reflecting on global counterparts grappling with similar challenges, such as the situation in Somalia, it becomes evident that an amalgam of significant naval forces was required. Remarkably, our nation stood resiliently on its own in addressing comparable challenges. As we commemorate 14 years since the culmination of that arduous conflict, the moment signals us to pivot our focus toward the present and the horizon that lies ahead. “Presently, the challenges we confront are distinct from the scenarios of 2009 and 1983. The dynamics of today’s landscape witness the encroachment of global power struggles into the Indian Ocean’s realm. On one front, a contest for supremacy unfolds between the United States and China across the expanses of the Pacific Ocean. Simultaneously, a power struggle emerges between Western nations and Russia in the context of Ukraine. This competition for influence extends even to remote reaches such as Niger in Africa, an adjacent nation to Mali, where our dedicated Army is stationed. “Undoubtedly, the Indian Ocean hosts the world’s pivotal trade routes, making Sri Lanka an integral player at this stage. As we navigate these waters, it is imperative that we chart a course devoid of entanglement in these international rivalries, maintaining an impartial stance. Our foremost concern must be the safeguarding of our security within this sphere. ‘Internally, various countries grapple with threats that emanate from within, a predicament exemplified by incidents like the tragic events of the Easter Sunday attack. Hence, it is incumbent upon us to fortify ourselves against such internal vulnerabilities as well. The reality we inhabit finds us enmeshed in global geopolitics; it is a reality we cannot disregard, compelling us to deliberate upon it, irrespective of our preferences. “Indeed, considering the evolving global landscape, I am inclined to initiate a comprehensive review of our nation’s prospective national security framework. Such evaluations are standard practice in numerous European countries, undertaken at intervals of five to ten years. These appraisals encompass an assessment of the nation’s vulnerabilities, available resources, and a strategic roadmap for implementation. These deliberations culminate in informed decisions, juxtaposing military capabilities with economic prowess. It is imperative for us to heed these principles. “Furthermore, we must acknowledge the impermanence of our current aerospace assets. The trajectory of aviation and naval technologies suggests an enhanced reliance on innovative solutions in the future, surpassing the capacities of the present. Our trajectory forward necessitates a progressive incorporation of advanced technologies to effectively address the challenges that await us. “In this context, my intent is to instigate a comprehensive review of our nation’s security apparatus. This review is poised to adopt a forward-looking perspective, intricately tied to emerging economic trends and the pressing issue of climate change. This recalibration of focus is paramount to effectively respond to the multifaceted challenges that lie ahead.”"

In line with the BOC’s aspirations to become a carbon-neutral bank, the Bank finalized a comprehensive Carbon Management Plan in 2022 while putting in place new strategies for measurement, mitigation, and management of its carbon footprint. Bank of Ceylon has already initiated numerous  actions to increase the natural capital of the Bank which includes energy saving at branch levels and use of renewable energy, compliance to green building concepts, encouraging the Bank’s staff with carpooling and staff transport to combat the fuel crisis and introducing of Solar Loans. The Global warming has become an overwhelming environmental issue due to release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere by man-made activities , which  has resulted in  increasing atmospheric emissions. Therefore, BOC early on has joined the global efforts to combat GHG emissions by making it a priority task to become more environmentally friendly and conscious. These efforts are also combined with Bank’s tree planting campaigns that were conducted at large scale and at branch level.  BOC  as a leading carbon -conscious bank has been measuring and reporting its GHG emissions since 2018. In taking a further step in this direction towards carbon neutrality, the Bank decided to measure and report GHG emissions  for 2022 covering the Bank’s  head office, provincial offices and 571 branches (Including extensions and regional loan centers) and quarters in provinces. The operational GHG emission of the Bank, for the one year period starting from 1st of January 2022 to 31st of December 2022 ,was calculated by a third-party assessment by Climate Smart Initiative (PVT) Ltd and verified by the third-party independent verification  by Sri Lanka Climate Fund (Pvt) Ltd in accordance to with ISO 14064-1:2018 as meeting the requirements of the ISO 14064-1:2018. Consequently, the Bank has been awarded a ‘reasonable level’ of assurance. Under the Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 and Scope 4 emissions of the Bank Head Office building, all province offices, all branches, SME Centers and Regional Loan Centers of the Bank.  The total carbon footprint of the Bank for 2022 was 27,333 tCO2e while per capita emissions and emission intensity stood at 3.33 tCO2e per person and 0.18 tCO2e per million rupees respectively (considering direct and indirect emissions). The reporting of organisational level GHG emissions based on data accordance with ISO 14064-1-2018 and United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) considered to be more comprehensive as it includes not only direct GHG emissions but also wide range of indirect GHG emissions, which are not within the control of the organization. As per the ISO 14064-1 GHG Assessment guidelines the Bank already adheres and ensures to maintain the reporting requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards which the Bank accurately reports its sustainability aspects in its Annual Report, quantified utility usage related data of the Bank. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

He said the distribution of pure pipe-borne drinking water to consumers has been impacted and only10 per cent of what was available prior to the sparking of the El Nino situation in the country, is available now. The Minister said this amidst the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) urging the public to use water sparingly, raising concerns pertaining to the supply of purified drinking water. Accordingly, the NWSDB stated that the overall daily purified drinking water supply capacity has decreased by 9 per cent. Thus, people have been advised to use water sparingly. While addressing the media at the Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Ministry, Minister Thondaman said the Government has taken every possible step to keep the situation under control by making additional arrangements to provide water to affected areas. He said the Department of Meteorology had predicted, in May this year, that such a situation would arise in the country and there is a need to make alternative arrangements to face this situation. Furthermore, the people who criticise the NWSDB for increasing the water tariff failed to think of the service it is doing to the common man by providing water at a nominal price, according to Thondaman. Drinking water is supplied to highly affected areas by bowsers. A programme is currently underway to extend the water in the facilities at the pumping houses owned by the Board. The consumers must refrain from wasting the water except for essential purposes until the situation returns to normal, he said. Water is currently being diverted to small water bodies from large tanks to administrate the shortage for drinking water, Minister Thondaman added. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

These directives were issued during a meeting at the Presidential Secretariat recently, where he engaged with a committee responsible for assessing the progress of Sri Lanka’s tourism industry enhancement programme and proposing measures to establish the country as a prominent tourist destination, the PMD stated. During the discussion, comprehensive plans, spanning short, medium and long terms were thoroughly deliberated upon to enhance Sri Lanka’s appeal and comfort for tourists. President Wickremesinghe inquired about on-going plans and the role of the private sector in promoting the nation’s tourism industry. Officials briefed the President on current initiatives and emerging trends. According to the recommendations set forth by the committee tasked with establishing Sri Lanka as a leading tourist destination, the Ministry of Tourism and its affiliated bodies are formulating a strategic plan for up to 2025. Remarkably, 95 per cent of this plan has already been completed. President Wickremesinghe also directed officials to identify a suitable location, in collaboration with the private sector, for the establishment of a high-class hotel school in Sri Lanka. To enhance lodging options for tourists visiting Sri Lanka, the President issued additional directives. Officials have been tasked with investigating and compiling a report on currently unused buildings and historic bungalows. Additionally, they are to explore a programme to unearth unexplored destinations and conceive new projects in tourist-centric areas. With the aim of fostering a favourable investment climate, the President’s plan involves the establishment of an Investment Infrastructure Corporation, alongside the formation of a decision-making council. Emphasising the significance of Provincial Tourism Boards across all nine provinces, the President advocated for the creation of regional committees under each board. Minister of Tourism and Lands, Harin Fernando, said that several tourism promotion initiatives have been devised in anticipation of the forthcoming Asia Cup.  He highlighted the unexplored potential in Central and Uva Provinces, particularly in the Central Province where air quality remains pristine. Minister Fernando proposed developing this province as a sustainable tourism hub. Addressing congestion issues at airports and parks, Minister Fernando underscored the focus on enhancing visitor amenities. Attending the event were key figures including Presidential Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Ratnayaka, Presidential Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism and Lands H.M.B.P.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

President of the CTU Priyantha Fernando stated that currently a trend could be witnessed in the education sector where teachers opt to leave the profession to go overseas. He however, warned that if the situation is not arrested effectively soon, it could lead to the education sector collapsing in the immediate future. Fernando mentioned that a majority of teachers, who had left the profession, had been those teaching subjects such as English, Science, Mathematics, Technology and IT. He noted that the situation had been felt strongly in rural schools as the only teachers available for such subjects had resigned seeking to go abroad. He added that in light of the decision taken by the Government not to take new recruits to the State sector the trend of teachers deciding to leave for abroad in droves could signal the death knell for education here, sooner than later. The CTU President opined that the number of vacancies for teachers in the country currently exceeds 40,000 and maintained that if the Education Ministry fails to address this issue it could deal a hammer blow to the country’s student population.

He highlighted the critical role of science and technology in various sectors of the world economy. Notably, he pointed out that areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology, and genome science have significant impacts on the global economy. President Wickremesinghe said, this during the 2019/2020 annual prize-giving ceremony at Anula Vidyalaya in Nugegoda on Wednesday (16). He stressed the importance of moving forward collectively towards the future, steering away from political traditions fixated on the past. He underlined that progress for the country depends on embracing a novel education system. During the event, President Wickremesinghe also honoured accomplished female students from Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda who excelled in the recent Advanced Level examination. He expressed gratitude towards the dedicated teachers and was presented with a commemorative gift by the school’s principal, marking the historic occasion of a President visiting Anula Vidyalaya in Nugegoda. Further addressing the gathering, the President extended his appreciation to the teachers and students, acknowledging the substantial progress of Anula Vidyalaya. He reflected on the school’s humble beginnings and its transformation into one of the country’s leading educational institutions. Emphasising the school’s role in shaping future generations, he highlighted the evolution of the education system over the past five decades. “During the time of President J.R. Jayewardene, the education landscape primarily consisted of textbooks. However, today’s educational paradigm has integrated the use of cell phones and computers. This evolution also extends to the realm of transportation, as the concept of electric vehicles was non-existent in the past, but now they are an integral part of society. The rapid advancement of science and technology is evident, necessitating a contemporary education system to thrive in this environment. It’s evident that a country’s progress hinges on an education system that aligns with societal needs. To build a prosperous nation, it’s imperative to nurture a promising future generation. Education stands as the cornerstone for laying the foundation to empower this generation to surmount challenges. The need of the hour is an education framework that is forward-thinking and future-oriented. Our nation must be equipped to confront the potential challenges arising from climate change. The global phenomenon of climate change warrants meticulous study, as exemplified by the present environmental crises in Europe. The United Nations’ decision to advance the climate change agenda’s implementation by a decade, due to the urgent nature of the issue, underscores the gravity of the situation. Nations worldwide are gearing up to fulfil the climate agenda by 2040, a decade ahead of the original 2050 timeline. The modern world economy thrives on various sectors driven by scientific and technological advancements. Artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology, and genome science represent just a fraction of the fields influencing the global economy. It’s paramount that we ready ourselves for these transformative shifts. Economists project that the integration of these technologies could contribute a substantial USD 300 to USD 700 trillion to the global economy by the mid-21st Century. The world is progressing within this economic trajectory, necessitating our proactive preparedness,” he added. In attendance at this event was Minister of Education Dr. Susil Premajayantha, Minister of Transport, Highways and Mass Media Dr. Bandula Gunawardana, Minister of Wildlife and Forest Conservation Pavithra Wanniarachchi, President’s Senior Adviser on National Security and Presidential Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake, MP Jagath Kumara and Major Pradeep Undugoda, along with Governor of the Western Province Air Marshal Roshan Goonetileke.
