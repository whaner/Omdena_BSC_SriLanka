https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/12/19/politicians-must-retire-at-60-maha-sangha/,Politicians must retire at 60 – Maha Sangha,Author not found,0,2022-12-18T20:50:00+00:00," The Maha Sangha is of the view that local politicians should voluntarily retire at the age of 60 and give opportunities to young people who can work. If doctors, engineers, and other professionals in the State service retire at the age of sixty, the same law must apply to all politicians, according to Venerable Kappitiyagoda Sirivimala Thera, Anunayake of the Rajopavanaramadhipati Ramanna Nikaya of Gatambe. He was speaking at the  Gatambe Vihara when Prof. G.L. Peiris paid a visit yesterday (18). “The Prime Minister has issued a circular in this regard stating that at the age of sixty, all State employees should retire. This means that after the age of sixty, people experience physical, mental, and health problems, as well as other weaknesses, so the retirement age has been set at sixty years, as recommended by doctors. How can politicians work after sixty years?” he queried. Speaking further, he said the same law should apply to politicians as well. Otherwise it was a grave  injustice for retire only state employees to retire at sixty. “How can politicians work if state employees cannot? This is an amusing fact. We, the Maha Sangha, believe that politicians in this country should voluntarily retire at the age of 60 and make opportunities available to young people who can work. Otherwise, there is no reason to stay in Parliament until you walk with a walking stick. Many people define public service as serving themselves. Because of the privileges, many do not even consider retiring from Parliament,” he said. Speaking further, the Thera highlighted that this system should be changed and that youth groups should be given opportunities, adding that Parliament was the most powerful place in the country to take decisions and make laws.”How can people who can’t think and whose health has deteriorated work to build a country?” he queried. “If there are academics or other people over the age of sixty, they can get their services by forming a voluntary parliamentary advisory council. The masses are unable to bear the burden of life. Despite claims that there is no money to do anything in the country, the number of ministers continues to grow. They are attempting to spend and sell the country’s resources to accomplish this,” he said. The Thera also requested that all such things should stop, that political opinions be set aside and that everyone should come together and work to lift the country out of the abyss it has fallen into, even if only for a short time.

With the number of dengue cases soaring to over 70, 000 by the second week of December 2022 the National Convener, HEA, Disnaka Dissanayake urged the two top officials in the Health Ministry to give them legal backing to inspect domestic premises. He said yesterday (18) that his members quite often faced public hostility when they visited houses to inspect and research for the dengue vector. In the most recent incident which occurred on Friday (16) when an Entomologist had been faced with the hostile behaviour by a member of the public in Bandaragama, Kalutara area during vector inspection work. The person is seen in a video clip allegedly using obscene language, threatening the Entomologist and demanded that prior notice should be given before visiting. He vehemently objects to the Entomologist’s presence in his premises saying that they too are like the Sri Lanka Police.  “This is not the only time that people have shown hostility towards us and behaved threateningly,” he lamented noting that lack of awareness with regard to the work carried out by Entomologists was possibly one of the reasons for such hostility. “ Entomologists only go to carry out vector inspections and research work. We don’t want to add to the burden of the public as we understand that they too are under tremendous stress,” he said. However, Entomologists only aim to inspect and research the dengue mosquito vector and reduce the public burden of falling ill with dengue fever at this juncture.  There is no necessity to add to the burden that people already carry by having to deal with a mosquito borne disease as well, Dissanayake observed. According to the Dengue Sentinel Site Surveillance, Epidemiology Unit (DenSys) last year when there were only a few over 35 924 dengue cases this year from 01 January to 18 December 2022 there have been over 72, 321cases. The cases for November amounted to 4,561. The high risk areas at present were Colombo (16,326), Gampaha (12,169) and Kalmunai (1,822).  The vector density is high in Gampaha and Puttalam. According to the Dengue Control Unit’s Dengue update Kalutara has recorded 5,940 dengue cases by the 49th week.      Incidents such as this have been reported in the past when public health inspectors (PHIs) and the Tri Forces who assisted the dengue control programme faced severe hostility and even paid with their lives during house to house inspections.

Pactet further said that the European Commission (EC) will be reviewing GSP + in 2025. A key condition in ensuring GSP+ post-2025 is Sri Lanka’s adherence to human rights (HR). Asked whether a Truth Commission in the lines of South Africa’s… …Truth Commission would be to the satisfaction of the EU/France, Pactet said that he would have to first speak to civil society here before expressing an opinion on this subject.

President Wickremesinghe stated this, while participating in the District Development Committee meeting held at the Badulla District Secretariat yesterday (15) morning. During the meeting, the President emphasised that Government officials should use the law as a shield to serve the people and not the companies. The President further said, “A scientific report should be obtained before removing pine trees from these areas. During the rule of the English in this country, tea was cultivated while pine trees were also there. Therefore, don’t fall for the wrong ideas. Before removing the pine trees, it is necessary to scientifically investigate if they would have an impact on the catchment areas. Why do you want to uproot the pine cultivation and opt for turpentine cultivation it will have an impact on the catchment areas.” “Government officials should act efficiently. I don’t need excuses. There is no way that there could be problems between government departments. As a government, everyone should come together and serve the people. In the plantation field, some officials use the law as a shield. I paid attention to this when preparing this Act in the ‘80s,” he added. When discussing the educational problems in this area, the shortage of teachers was highlighted. A year or two after the appointment of teachers, they get transfers. The Ministry of Education and the Provincial Council should discuss and take a decision not to transfer teachers until five years pass after their appointment. The President said the proposal to get new land for plantation schools will be considered and necessary steps will be taken. “For the promotion of the health sector in the Badulla District, the necessary facilities will be provided to upgrade the Mahiyangana Regional Hospital to a District Hospital. Also, we are working to allocate money for the expenses of the kidney hospital in Girandurukotte. If a problem has arisen regarding the development of the Bandarawela Hospital due to the Diyatalawa Base Hospital, steps will be taken to investigate it. The steps to upgrade the Bandarawela District Hospital to a base hospital have been assigned to the Ministry of Health, and they should look into it. Moreover, there may be some delay in providing money for the necessary equipment to the Badulla General Hospital, as receiving of foreign aid has stopped due to the declaration of bankruptcy of our country,” he revealed. “All the lands related to the development of the Badulla Province General Hospital have been released so far.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

President Wickremesinghe stated this, while participating in the District Development Committee meeting held at the Badulla District Secretariat yesterday (15) morning. During the meeting, the President emphasised that Government officials should use the law as a shield to serve the people and not the companies. The President further said, “A scientific report should be obtained before removing pine trees from these areas. During the rule of the English in this country, tea was cultivated while pine trees were also there. Therefore, don’t fall for the wrong ideas. Before removing the pine trees, it is necessary to scientifically investigate if they would have an impact on the catchment areas. Why do you want to uproot the pine cultivation and opt for turpentine cultivation it will have an impact on the catchment areas.” “Government officials should act efficiently. I don’t need excuses. There is no way that there could be problems between government departments. As a government, everyone should come together and serve the people. In the plantation field, some officials use the law as a shield. I paid attention to this when preparing this Act in the ‘80s,” he added. When discussing the educational problems in this area, the shortage of teachers was highlighted. A year or two after the appointment of teachers, they get transfers. The Ministry of Education and the Provincial Council should discuss and take a decision not to transfer teachers until five years pass after their appointment. The President said the proposal to get new land for plantation schools will be considered and necessary steps will be taken. “For the promotion of the health sector in the Badulla District, the necessary facilities will be provided to upgrade the Mahiyangana Regional Hospital to a District Hospital. Also, we are working to allocate money for the expenses of the kidney hospital in Girandurukotte. If a problem has arisen regarding the development of the Bandarawela Hospital due to the Diyatalawa Base Hospital, steps will be taken to investigate it. The steps to upgrade the Bandarawela District Hospital to a base hospital have been assigned to the Ministry of Health, and they should look into it. Moreover, there may be some delay in providing money for the necessary equipment to the Badulla General Hospital, as receiving of foreign aid has stopped due to the declaration of bankruptcy of our country,” he revealed. “All the lands related to the development of the Badulla Province General Hospital have been released so far. I request you to implement its future activities. In the future, we will work towards establishing an emergency treatment unit for tourists in that hospital.

However, GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over three trillion rupees for a record consecutive 110 market days to Wednesday due to a persistent lack of revenue. Liquidity was uplift by Rs 25,286 million (US$ 69.62 million)  to Wednesday due to the settlement/s of swaps between the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and the GoSL and/or between CBSL and the market. Swaps between GoSL and CBSL are foreign reserves neutral. GoSL’s at least theoretical MP borrowing costs (BCs) decreased for the third consecutive market day to Wednesday, this time such a fall accelerating by 2.10 per cent (Rs 2,542.05 million) to Rs 118,254.09 million due to ‘sustained’ buying pressure of Treasury (T) Bills and T Bonds in secondary market trading, enticed by high yields offered at the expense of lending to the private sector, the engine of growth. Market shortfall decreased by 3.38 per cent (Rs 13,722 million) to Rs 392,766 million, nonetheless causing sustained rate pressure on Wednesday. Market was short for a record 310 market days to Wednesday.  GoSL’s highest to the 315th highest FVMP debt has been recorded in the 315 consecutive market days to Wednesday. CBSL which administers daily open market operations (OMO) lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL.  GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot’. The ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and to lower the cost of energy imports which are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee as Sri Lanka is an import dependent economy.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/12/16/led-by-inflation-poverty-line-rises-for-18th-consecutive-month/,"Led by inflation, poverty line rises for 18th consecutive month",Author not found,0,2022-12-15T20:30:00+00:00," Sri Lanka’s monthly official poverty line (OPL) increased for the eighteenth consecutive month to October 2022, spurred by near record high inflation, thereby increasing by 1.73 per cent (Rs 238) to Rs 13,810 month on month (MoM), ie  October 2022 over September 2022, Census and Statistics Department (CSD) data, released on Wednesday (14), showed.   In the previous month September, this monthly figure (OPL) was Rs 13,460. The monthly OPL at Rs 13,810 in October 2022 means that an individual needed to earn a minimum of Rs 13,882 that month to be able to buy the bare necessities of life and thus to be considered as being non-poor, according to the CSD. Meanwhile, in the 18-month period beginning April 2021 and ending October 2022, Sri Lanka’s OPL has increased by over two fold or by more than 150 per cent (Rs 8,633) to Rs 13,810; a 166.76 per cent increase, led by a depreciated rupee, scarred harvests and import bans and controls that have given an impetus to record high inflation, official data further showed. The OPL in April 2021 was a mere Rs 5,177. The last time OPL, MoM, declined was 18 months ago from October 2022, ie in April 2021 over March 2021, where the OPL fell by a negligible 0.08 per cent (four rupees) to Rs 5,177, before increasing since. The OPL in March 2021 was Rs 5,181. The definition of OPL by the CSD is the minimum monthly earnings needed by an individual in the country to be considered as being ‘non-poor’. The meaning of ‘non poor’ is the amount needed by such an individual to buy the bare necessities of life for a month in order to keep ‘his nose above the water’ without falling into poverty and want, as per the CSD definition. According to the last official poverty survey conducted by the CSD in 2019, it was found that 3.04 million of Sri Lanka’s population was poor. This accounted for 14.3 per cent of Sri Lanka’s population that year. BY Paneetha Ameresekere"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

SLOTS is conducted by Institute for Health Policy (IHP). President Ranil Wickremesinghe, leader of the UNP, has the least negative favourability ratings, although by a small margin. The past three months have seen a fresh decline in favourability for most, giving back some modest gains since August. Ironically, there is some evidence that Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s ratings have started to recover from the deep lows they maintained for most of the year, with his favourability rating recovering to a net negative 51 per cent in November. In November, President Wickremesinghe was viewed unfavourably by a net 46 per cent of Sri Lankans, but this was still marginally better than other Party Leaders. Opposition and SJB leader Sajith Premadasa had a net negative rating of 57 per cent, not significantly different to that of Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) and JVP leader, who had a net negative rating of 55 per cent. SLOTS has been tracking favourability of leading politicians daily since August 2021. Through the end of 2021, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, leader of the SLPP, maintained an edge in favourability over Opposition Leader, Sajith Premadasa, although some ministers maintained even better favourability ratings, particularly Ministers Ali Sabry and Dr Sudarshini Fernandopulle. But the economic and political crisis that hit at the start of the year collapsed President Rajapaksa’s favourability and dragged down the favourability ratings of all politicians we track, with the public expressing unfavourable views of all by April 2022. From June, the favourability of the other party leaders began to recover but remained deeply negative through October, after which the latest interviews suggest the public is becoming more negative in their views. Ranil Wickremasinghe maintained modestly more negative ratings than Sajith Premadasa through the end of 2021, but since the current crisis hit and following his election as President; his ratings have generally been slightly less negative. However, public views of both of them appear to have become more negative since September 2022. IHP’s Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) is a telephone survey that interviews nationally representative samples of the public every day. SLOTS tracks favourability by asking respondents if they have a favourable or unfavourable opinion of a public figure or institution: net favourability being the average of the positive and negative responses. The question that SLOTS uses is a standard one used in similar surveys around the world. Scores range from +100 (everyone has a favourable view) to -100 (everyone has an unfavourable view). This is more an indicator of general sentiment about politicians than how people will vote, something that SLOTS tracks separately."

Additional Solicitor General Nerin Pulle raised preliminary objections on the Jurisdiction of the Court to hear the case, stating that the decision is a matter of policy and the Cabinet of Ministers are entitled to make decisions pertaining to matters of policy. Jayawardena, appearing for the petitioners, submitted to Court that the said decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, dated 17 October, has been made illegally and in complete violation of their legitimate expectation to continue in service at least until 63 years of age. The Petitioners’ position is that since 2017, as consultant specialist doctors, they have been guaranteed a defined compulsory age of retirement of 63 years, by both Cabinet Decisions as well as by the Amendment to the Minute on Pensions and therefore, that they were distinctly identified as a separate category, different and separate to that of other categories of public officers in general and that this status and legitimate expectation had been continuing for a period of 5 years, from 2017 up to 2022.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Speaking at a media briefing yesterday (14), Gammanpila said the President has pledged to bring a proposal to share power before the next Independence Day. “There is only 52 days for 4 February 2023. This issue has been ongoing for 65 years. We saw how this went throughout history. Every time leaders like Wickremesinghe brings proposals to share power like this to please the Tamil separatists, severe objections were raised by the Sinhalese community. Then those proposals had to be folded. So, we know what will happen to any proposal that brings a federal system. The same thing will happen this time too,” he said. Speaking further, Gammanpila said the Government is deceiving the country by claiming that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan will be approved in January, followed by a USD 1 billion loan from the Asian Development Bank. The truth is the Government has failed to reach a final agreement on bilateral loans, he said. He said there are local loans, bilateral loans, multilateral loans, and international market loans. “Multilateral loans are those obtained from international organisations such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the ADB. The Government has not had any meaningful discussions about multilateral debt restructuring. Countries such as Zimbabwe have negotiated with these international institutions and restructured their debt,” he said, adding that the Sri Lankan Government is yet to begin discussions.

The APC resulted in all parties agreeing to the constitutional provisions regarding power sharing, and the President agreed to meet them again next month for discussions, according to Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran. He also said their main proposals to immediately address the land taken from private owners, justice for the disappeared, and the release of the remaining prisoners detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act should be implemented before the Independence Day celebrations next year. Sumanthiran said they requested to work on all in parallel by 31 January 2023. Sumanthiran said the President had previously stated that he would address Tamil issues before the Independence celebrations, and that they had reminded him of this. Also discussed was the new Constitution’s power sharing module, to which Foreign Minister Ali Sabry reiterated South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission model. Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on the other hand said they have begun expediting investigations on the disappearances that took place during the war. He said there are 65 more cases of disappearances that his ministry will look into. The TNA stated that the President submitted the draft in 2019 and that it will be taken forward. It was said discussing about constitutional reforms takes time. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa had also backed the TNA in this regard. Before discussing the new Constitution and the federal structure of power sharing, on which the President had not commented, the TNA had also reiterated that the Provincial Council Elections must be held. Meanwhile, Leader of the Tamil Progressive Party (TPA), MP Mano Ganesan claimed that the discussion was not limited to the North and East. “The implementation of the 13A is the point to which the majority have agreed while being present there,” he added. He also pointed out that the provincial council mechanism is operational in all nine provinces. “Many party leaders, including the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, have publicly expressed their support for 13A. So let that serve as the starting point.” “I drew the attention to the fact that the full implementation of 13A would be the way forward once the chief ministers’ conclave with much Southern Provincial Council wanted it,” he said.

Explaining the situation, President of the Academy of Health Professionals (AHP), Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (14) said the Government had spent a large sum of money between 2016 to 2018 to purchase digital and Computerised Processing Units to upgrade the X-ray service. Till then, the traditional system was being used in hospitals. With the new system in place, the X-ray could be used at any time and in any place as a referral.   “But like buying the cow and not the rope, the machines were purchased without providing the networking system,” he lamented. Only National Hospitals Colombo and Kandy, and Teaching Hospital Karapitiya were given the networking facility. Teaching Hospital, Kurunegala was never availed of the network facility despite having the digital technology to take the X-ray images. It has been forced to use the traditional method of issuing X-ray film for its upgraded digitalised method of taking X-rays.  Many hospitals with the digital or computerised X-ray facility were forced to combine the technologies obtained with the turn of the millennium with that of the traditional method used in the 1990s. There was no networking facility to send the image to the doctor and the patient for reference. “Authorities of Teaching Hospital, Kurunegala are now faced with a quandary as bills for the X-ray film that have been purchased have not been paid and therefore the supplier has stopped providing film,” Kumudesh alleged. The Hospital had to spend around Rs 2 million each month for X-ray film alone.   He said, at present, patients are asked to use their smart phones to photograph the image of the X-ray to present it to their relevant doctors. Attempts to contact the authorities of Teaching Hospital, Kurunegala were futile. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

He said, at the outset the IMF’s Executive Board expressed that they do not expect to formally approve Sri Lanka’s bailout before the end of this year. The bilateral creditors are India, China, and Japan, and their debts to Sri Lanka must be restructured in accordance with the IMF’s recommendations to obtain the loan facility, but IMF’s online board calendar, which has added meetings through 22 December to discuss progress, makes no mention of a meeting with Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has been urging the bilateral creditors to cooperate in assisting the country, as mounting debts have hampered the country’s finances. State Minister Semasinghe added that bilateral creditors have expressed their desire to support Sri Lanka and they are thankful to the creditors. The Minister added that the authorities are having continuous progressive discussions and exchange of information. “We will miss the intended formal approval of IMF in December 2022, but are working hard to complete the required process by early next year,” he said. Last week, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said if creditor assurances from China and India can be obtained this month, Sri Lanka can expect IMF Rapid Financing approval in January. Also, last week, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said she had a “fruitful exchange” with her Chinese counterparts about repeated calls for accelerated debt relief to countries like Zambia and Sri Lanka.

He highlighted all scales should be registered once a year with the Weight and Measurement Units, Standards and Services Division at the District Secretariat, but it has been revealed that many of the scales in the country are not. According to the Minister, because most of the scales used in Sri Lanka are of poor quality, farmers are being exploited in the purchase of their products. The Minister said, this during a discussion at the Ministry of Agriculture. “In Bulathsinhala, Police intervened and weighed a bag of urea fertiliser given by an agricultural service centre, but it was reported that the required amount of fertiliser was in the proper weight,” he said. In this regard, Amaraweera said many traders weigh produce using hanging bow scales, adding that most of these scales are of poor quality, and traders steal a large portion of the farmers’ income. He also pointed out that even if only two kilogrammes of each farmer’s produce is swindled, it costs farmers a fortune in the long run. Thus, the Minister directed Agriculture Secretary Gunadasa Samarasinghe to immediately begin a joint work arrangement with the Weighing and Measuring Department to prevent the use of these fake scales."

The CEBH Director on 6 December wrote to the National University Health System, Singapore stating that neither he nor the Special Grade Nursing Officer would take responsibility for the forged document that had been submitted.     Following this letter, the quota granted by Singapore for Sri Lankan nurses could be cancelled, allegations have been levelled. Deputy Director General (Education, Training and Research) of the Health Ministry, Dr. Sunil de Alwis said he was aware of the issue. The Ministry, he said would have to conduct a preliminary investigation into the matter to verify as to what really had happened. He said the two governments had a good understanding and that delegates from Singapore had visited Sri Lanka and selected nurses to serve in their hospitals. When contacted, informed health sources yesterday (13) said contrary to the claims made by a particular nurse who had left Sri Lanka to serve in Singapore and the local nursing unions, she (the nurse) had left for Singapore through a foreign job agency. “There were talks between the two countries for the deployment of State hospital nurses to Singapore for jobs. However, the particular nurse had allegedly submitted a forged document using the hospital letterhead as a certification of her service in many of the CEBH’s units to obtain the job.” They pointed out that the hospital could only issue a “service report.” According to the Establishment Code, a letterhead could not be used on such occasions. However, in this case the particular nurse had submitted certification from the Chief Special Grade Nursing Officer using the hospital letterhead, sources alleged. But now the Grade Medical Officer denies having issued such a letter in writing while the Hospital Director, Dr. Priyantha Karunarathne had sent indirect copies to the particular job agency and the Hospital in which the nurse was serving in Singapore. Parties with vested interests were attempting to convince the public that she had left for Singapore with a group comprising other nurses in keeping with a government to government agreement inked by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The proposal was made at the recently concluded third ‘No Money For Terror’ (NMFT) Ministerial Conference in New Delhi. Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to India, Milinda Moragoda, who led the Sri Lankan delegation to the Ministerial Conference, made this proposal in his statement to the Conference on 19 November. The ‘No Money For Terror’ Ministerial Conference on Counter-Terrorism Financing’ was held on 18 and 19 November 2022 in New Delhi. It was hosted by the Government of India. The Conference, which was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi on 18 November saw the participation of delegations from ninety-three countries and multilateral organisations. The Conference extensively discussed global trends in terrorism and terrorist financing, use of formal and informal channels of funds for terrorism, emerging technologies and terrorist financing and request international co-operation to address challenges in combating terrorist financing.  Delivering Sri Lanka’s country statement, Moragoda further stated that political will on the part of member States is the most significant component in international cooperation to address the multi-faceted challenges faced when combating terrorist financing. He said that though the objective of the Conference on ‘No Money for Terror’, which is to sensitise the international community to the dangers of ignoring this issue, is commendable, there should be a mechanism to provide continuity to the work of the Conference. In this context, Moragoda proposed that India, as the Chair of the present Conference, take the lead in creating a group of eminent persons selected from among the member States with a view to helping galvanise greater political will and to create further international awareness among States on the importance of combating terrorist financing.  The first and second ‘No Money For Terror’ Ministerial Conferences were held in Paris in 2018 and Melbourne in 2019. The third NMFT Conference was built on the progressive agenda of an integrated approach with collective involvement initiated in the first two Conferences.  (SRM)"

Minister Rajapakshe said there were over 500,000 addicted to dangerous drugs. But there is a severe need to fortify the rehabilitation process to cater to all those victims of drug abuse. Liyanarachchi said pointing out that currently there were only rehabilitation centres set up by National Dangerous Drug Control Board and the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation which has only the Kandakadu Rehabilitation Centre. At present there were 5,000 inmates being rehabilitated in Kandakadu, he noted adding that it was highly inadequate at this juncture when the use of dangerous drugs had increased tremendously. The government should move to set up rehabilitation centres in all districts and formulate three-month short-term programmes for the rehabilitation of all drug users. “We understand that the government would not have sufficient funds to be able to cater to the needs of all those centres. But there are a large number of non-government and civil organisations prepared to help and provide funds for the centres.  Small time drug users should be sent for rehabilitation and not to prison where they allegedly come into contact with other criminals and drug pedlars. When they come out of prison they too would have formed new alliances and would have fine tuned their knowledge and may resort to other forms of criminal activities, Liyanarachchi warned urging the law enforcement officers and government authorities to issue prison terms only to those involved in the drug racket and not to the users.  The NADF Convener said that a National Task Force comprising members of the Tri-Forces, Police and the Excise Department should be set up to carry out operations and they should be made responsible to the public. There should be transparency in their activities and they should be able to keep the public informed with regard to their activities at least on a monthly basis.          By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/12/14/urbanisation-kills-40-of-colombos-wetlands-wb/,Urbanisation kills 40% of Colombo’s wetlands – WB,Author not found,0,2022-12-13T20:30:00+00:00,"About 40 per cent of Colombo’s wetlands have been lost to urbanisation over the last several decades, the World Bank (WB) said on Monday (12). The WB, in an article titled ‘Cities Look to Nature for Climate Solutions,’ said consequently two major floods in 2010 highlighted the need to restore them. Colombo’s wetlands form a teeming network of ecosystems among office towers, colonial buildings, temples, and minarets, it said. This expanse of nearly 20 square kilometres of freshwater lakes, wet woodlands, wet grasslands, and swamps is home to pink lotus flowers, spotted butterflies, and the elusive fishing cat, the WB said. Consequently, the Metro Colombo Urban Development Project, supported by the WB, led to technical and policy dialogue that resulted in the preservation of Colombo’s remaining wetlands such as the above and their integration into the city – earning Colombo international recognition as the first capital to be accredited as a wetland city under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the WB said. The project’s goal goes beyond preventing future flooding to reposition urban parks and wetlands as the beating heart of city life, it said. Beyond improvements at the urban core, projects like this, offer more widespread economic lift, while keeping in line with goals to limit the emissions that contribute to a changing climate, the WB said. Because wetlands mitigate disaster risk in a cost-effective way while strengthening or rehabilitating ecosystems, nature-based solutions programmes can offer other benefits including enhanced agriculture and fisheries, improved water supply services, and opportunities to increase tourism, recreation, and access to cultural heritage, which support local economic and human welfare, the WB said. Further, wetlands soak up floodwaters and release them safely when the waters recede, working together with hard infrastructure such as pumping stations and underground tunnels to protect the City. Wetlands also operate as natural air conditioners, water and air purifiers, carbon sinks, agricultural havens, and safe harbours for biodiversity, it said. By addressing climate change, improving the lives of the most vulnerable, and increasing economic development, nature-based solutions offer a win-win-win for people and planet, the WB in conclusion said.

This was when the Writ application filed by Social activist Oshala Herath was taken before Court of Appeal Judges Sobitha Rajakaruna and Dhammika Ganepola. Court also ordered the Attorney General to file documents requested by the Petitioner on the next date. Previously, the Court ordered the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration (CGIE) to submit all documents pertaining to Gamage’s citizenship. Attorneys-at-Law Hafeel Farisz with Nishika Fonseka, instructed by Attorney-at-Law Gayan Darshan, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, noted that the matter should be considered as one of extreme urgency as the decisions made by Gamage in her capacity as an MP are illegal. The Petitioner sought an order in the nature of a Writ of Quo Warranto, requiring Gamage to show by what authority she claims to hold office and continues to function as a Member of Parliament of Sri Lanka. Further, a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Quo Warranto, declaring that Gamage is disqualified to be an MP, was also sought. It was also stated in the Petition that Gamage is a British citizen and had concealed the fact that she was a British citizen, while stating that she is also not a Sri Lankan citizen. Further, the petitioner noted that Gamage had on several occasions used her British Passport to apply for and obtain visas to visit Sri Lanka. BY Faadhila Thassim"

Addressing a gathering at Kurana, Negombo, on Sunday (11) Cardinal Ranjith said that the culture nurtured by Buddhism should not be destroyed by night life activities. “What Sri Lanka needs is a philosophical revolution,” he observed. “Some ‘parangiyas’, who had come to Sri Lanka after being abroad, have proposed an increase in night life and the growth of cannabis. All this is being proposed while striving to make Sri Lanka free of dangerous drugs. There are talks about sentencing those found guilty of drug related offences to death. This together with other night life activities will destroy the Sri Lankan culture which is based on Buddhist philosophy. Therefore we urge religious leaders, particularly the Buddhist clergy, to take the lead in safeguarding our rich culture,” he said. Seeing how various institutions, lands and companies are handed over to various foreign companies and individuals, the Cardinal reminded the political leaders to refrain from using public favour to gain power and position."

Addressing a special gathering in Naples, Italy recently Dissanayake said, “The wave to elect Gotabaya Rajapaksa as the President was created by Sri Lankan migrant workers. When I see the crowd here in Naples today, I can sense a new wave that is about to be created.” He claimed that even if Budget 2023 wins in the Parliament, it would not be approved by the general public of the country. Dissanayake noted that Parliament does not represent the true opinion of the people. Instead of such a parliament, a parliament that represents the true opinion and wishes of the people should be appointed, he added. Dissanayake stressed that a country’s security depends on how economically strong it is. “In an economically collapsed country, security, pride, and dependence do not exist. The Prime Minister of Bangladesh says that Bangladesh will not be allowed to meet the same fate as Sri Lanka. The Parliament of Kenya says that it will not allow the calamity of Sri Lanka happen to Kenya,” he said. Dissanayake emphasised that Sri Lanka is being used as an international example of a country going bankrupt. “What has happened today is that the Treasury will not get any income even to pay the debt installments and interest for the coming year. The heads of State who have ruled this country for a long time have dragged the country into a situation where it does not have enough income to pay the debt interest and installments for a year,” he added. Dissanayake noted that even though the country is poor, the rulers are rich and their bank accounts are overflowing. Wealth that could have been used for health, education, factories and jobs has been looted by a small group and politicians are at the top of this group, he said. Only the JJB will punish the corrupt and take back the stolen wealth to re-build the country, he vowed and added, “The JJB would make economic changes that encourage Sri Lankans living abroad for the sake of building the country. We expect a large contribution from Sri Lankans abroad to get the foreign currency that we need immediately. We will create a government you can trust for that. Every dollar you send to the country will be used as an investment.” BY Aloka Kasturiarachchi"

Tamil National Alliance Leader R. Sampanthan, and his alliance Leaders, namely, MP D.

Wigneswaran, All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) Leader Rishad Bathiudeen, and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader Rauff Hakeem are also expected to be present. However, MP Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, Leader of the Tamil National People’s Front (TNPF), has stated that he will not attend because the President has not specified the parameters of the conference and what will be discussed. He added, “We’ve seen several of these types of conferences that resulted in nothing.” Furthermore, the President should inform the Southern political Parties of his intentions regarding the national issue, he pointed out. He added that the truth should be told in his discussion before seeing the Tamils. “I received a text message about a meeting at the Presidential Secretariat. We’ve been discussing constitutional reforms, but let him explain the federal system that we are demanding for, and then we’ll talk,” he said. TMK Leader MP C.V.

Meanwhile, TPA Leader MP Ganesan added that he would seek right placement in the Sri Lankan national polity at the all-party discussions and he would be representing the Hill Country Tamil community of recent Indian origin, who live outside Northern and Eastern Provinces. “Our political aspirations demand mainstreaming as full citizens in the Sri Lankan national polity,” MP Ganesan added. He confirmed participating in the all-party conclave called by the President and added, “We will impress upon the Government and the nation of our urge to find right placement within an undivided Sri Lanka as full citizens.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/12/13/integral-players-in-determining-innovative-solutions-to-fully-inclusive-societies/,Integral Players in determining innovative solutions to fully inclusive societies,Author not found,0,2022-12-12T20:30:00+00:00," Ten years ago, the Asia-Pacific region came together and designed the world’s first set of disability-specific development goals: the Incheon Strategy to “Make the Right Real” for Persons with Disabilities. This week, we meet again to assess how the governments have delivered on their commitments, to secure those gains and develop the innovative solutions needed to achieve fully inclusive societies. Ministers, government officials, persons with disabilities, civil society and private sector allies from across Asia and the Pacific will gather from 19 to 21 October in Jakarta to mark the birth of a new era for 700 million persons with disabilities and proclaim a fourth Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities. Our region is unique, having already declared three decades to protect and uphold the rights of persons with disabilities; 44 Asian and Pacific governments have ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; and we celebrate achievements in the development of disability laws, policies, strategies and programmes. Today, we have more parliamentarians and policymakers with disabilities. Their everyday business is national decision-making. They also monitor policy implementation. We find them active across the Asia-Pacific region: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Türkiye. They have promoted inclusive public procurement to support disability-inclusive businesses and accessible facilities, advanced sign language interpretation in media programmes and parliamentary sessions, focused policy attention on overlooked groups and directed numerous policy initiatives towards inclusion. Less visible but no less important are local-level elected politicians with disabilities in India, Japan and the Republic of Korea. Indonesia witnessed 42 candidates with disabilities standing in the last election. Grassroots disability organisations have emerged as rapid responders to emerging issues such as Covid-19 and other crises. Organisations of and for persons with disabilities in Bangladesh have distinguished themselves in disability-inclusive Covid-19 responses, and created programmes to support persons with psychosocial disabilities and autism. The past decade saw the emergence of private sector leadership in disability-inclusive business. Wipro, headquartered in India, pioneers disability inclusion in its multinational growth strategy. This is a pillar of Wipro’s diversity and inclusion initiatives. Employees with disabilities are at the core of designing and delivering Wipro digital services. Yet, there is always more unfinished business to address. Even though we applaud the increasing participation of persons with disabilities in policymaking, there are still only eight persons with disabilities for every 1,000 parliamentarians in the region. On the right to work, ‘3 in 4 persons’ with disabilities are not employed, while ‘7 in 10 persons’ with disabilities do not enjoy any form of social protection. This sobering picture points to the need for disability-specific and disability-inclusive policies and their sustained implementation in partnership with women and men with disabilities. One of the first steps to inclusion is recognising the rights of persons with disabilities. This model focuses on the person and their dignity, aspirations, individuality and value as a human being. As such, government offices, banks and public transportation and spaces must be made accessible for persons with diverse disabilities. To this end, governments in the region have conducted accessibility audits of government buildings and public transportation stations. Partnerships with the private sector have led to reasonable accommodations at work, promoting employment in a variety of sectors. Despite the thrust of the Incheon Strategy on data collection and analysis, persons with disabilities still are often left out of official data because the questions that allow for disaggregation are excluded from surveys and accommodations are not made to ensure their participation. This reflects a continued lack of policy priority and budgetary allocations. To create evidence-based policies, we need reliable and comparable data disaggregated by disability status, sex and geographic location. There is hope in the technology leap to 5G in the Asia-Pacific region. The implications for the empowerment of persons are limitless: from digital access, e-health care and assistive devices at affordable prices to remote learning and working, and exercising the right to vote. This is a critical moment to ensure disability-inclusive digitalisation. We live in a world of volatile change. A disability-inclusive approach to shaping this world would benefit everyone, particularly in a rapidly ageing Asia-Pacific region where everyone’s contributions will matter. As we stand on the precipice of a fourth Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities it remains our duty to insist on a paradigm shift to celebrate diversity and disability inclusion. When we dismantle barriers and persons with disabilities surge ahead, everyone benefits.

It was a great violation of fundamental rights of the Muslim community,” he said.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/12/13/sri-lanka-press-freedom-slips-from-127-to-146/,Sri Lanka Press Freedom Slips From 127 to 146,Author not found,0,2022-12-12T20:30:00+00:00," Sri Lanka dropped to 146 this year, from 127 in 2021, in the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) Freedom of the World Press 2022 index, remaining in the problematic range. The RSF thus concluded that fewer than one in five Sri Lankan citizens have access to politically independent media. In the ecnomic context, it revealed that the mass media market is highly concentrated. In broadcasting, the four big firms of the sector share approximately 80% of total viewership. Political authorities exert strong influence on appointments and dismissals of editors-in-chief, whether through political friendships, control over subsidies and advertising contracts or, simply, through corruption. As a result, the most independent news content comes from online networks. Journalists who run them, however, are not exempt from pressure and intimidation.  The survey included 180 countries, with Sri Lanka ranking 144 in the political indicator and 163 in the economic indicator. It ranks 150 in the social indicator and 134 in the security indicator.  The purpose of the World Press Freedom Index is to compare the level of press freedom enjoyed by journalists and media in 180 countries and territories. This comparison is based on a definition of press freedom formulated by RSF and its panel of experts when developing the new methodology to be used from 2022 onwards. The Index’s rankings are based on a score ranging from 0 to 100 that is assigned to each country or territory, with 100 being the best possible score (the highest possible level of press freedom) and 0 the worst. Press freedom issues are closely tied to the war against terrorism that ravaged the island until 2009, and to the crimes – still left unpunished – against many journalists during the crushing of the Tamil terrorist rebellion. With a media sector lacking diversity and highly dependent on major political clans, journalism is at risk. On Sri Lankan, the index notes that the Sri Lankan legal framework does not restrict freedom of expression, but there are no guarantees of protection for journalists. Above all, the Press Council, established in 1973 to “regulate” the sector, poses a major problem because the president appoints the majority of its members. Officials frequently use anti-terrorism legislation to silence journalists, particularly those who attempt to report on the conditions of the Tamil minority in the island’s North and East.

For this purpose, budget airlines will be launched as soon as possible. Otherwise, it is social injustice,” he said. “In addition, many countries have launched low-cost but safe airlines for the public, but as there is no such airline in Sri Lanka, it is necessary to prepare a work plan for it. Also, the youth should be encouraged to take up jobs in the aviation industry and become pilots as well. Through this, the country can earn a large amount of foreign exchange,” he further said. Further, the Minister said Sri Lankan airports ensure the safety of every arriving and departing aircraft. “Our civil aviation services are compliant with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards,” he added. The theme of this year’s International Aviation Day is ‘forward through innovation for global aviation.’ The event was chaired by the Minister and a group of officials including Ministry Secretary K.D.S.

Unless authorised by a general or specific licence issued by OFAC, or otherwise exempt, all transactions by US persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons are prohibited. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Section 7031(c) provides that in cases where there is credible information that officials of foreign governments have been involved in significant corruption or a gross violation of human rights, those individuals and their immediate family members are generally ineligible for entry into the United States and must be either publicly or privately designated.

The event will be held biennially commencing from this year to create a national platform for those who are in diverse institutions engaging in education research to meet and share findings and exchange views and opinions. It will bring together a wide audience of political leadership, policy planners, officers of implementing agencies, educationists and academics, postgraduates and undergraduate students for scholarly discourses and debates. State Minister for Higher Education Dr. Suren Raghavan will grace the occasion as the chief guest. It will be held on 16 December from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm at the BMICH, Colombo 7. The programme consists of eight keynote/ guest speeches delivered by eminent experts in education, allied fields and 27 research communications by researchers from the Universities, the National Institute of Education and Colleges of Education The National Education Commission (NEC), mandated by an Act of Parliament, is the apex body responsible for formulating national education policies and guiding education policy reforms in the country. The NEC was established as one of the outcomes of the recommendations made by the Youth Commission appointed in 1989, in the immediate aftermath of the 2nd Youth Insurrection during 1987 – 1989 period. It was stated that the Youth Commission had observed that there was a mismatch between education and employment, leading to large-scale unemployment and frustration among school leavers either before or after their examinations irrespective of whether they had passed or failed their examinations. It has also noted the moral vacuum, which the curriculum and the teaching methods or indifference of teachers had created. There were other major factors which had also caused much discontent among youth, but defects in the educational system inclusive of tertiary education had been perceived as the primary root causes of the problem. It was stated that therefore, there was an urgent need for introducing reforms into the education sector to eradicate the primary root causes of youth unrest while addressing their grievances. Then Minister of Education, Lalith Athulathudali in presenting the Bill for the establishment of the NEC at the parliament delivering his speech had stated that this Act will be the most important Act in the history of Sri Lankan education as it will provide the legal framework to prepare and maintain a sustainable education policy for the country. “It is the general acceptance of the society that the education policy changes from government to government, minister to minister and officer to officer. Therefore, the purpose of presenting this Bill is for the establishment of an institutional mechanism to prepare and maintain a continuing and consistent national education policy,” he said. The first Commission was instituted in July 2021 and was headed by Prof. Lakshman Jayathilake who served as the Chairman of the Youth Commission. Since its inspection, there have been eight successive Commissions with 5-year tenures consisting of renowned personalities, it was stated. The functions of the Commission as defined by the National Education Commission Act No. 19 of 1991 are to make recommendations to the President, on educational policy in all aspects. Also, to review and analyse periodically the national education policy plans or plans in operation and when necessary, to recommend to the President, changes in such policy. Additionally, plan to advise the President on any other matter relating to education which may be referred to it by the President, for its advice.   The NEC is also mandated to review and analyse periodically the national education policy and plans in operation and where necessary recommend changes. The most recent policy document titled ‘National Education Policy Framework (2020 – 2030)’ was released in June 2022. It is the first policy document which was formulated by taking into consideration of the entire education sector that includes eight sub-sectors. They are namely, Early Childhood Care and Education, General Education, Higher Education, Technical and Vocational Education and Training, Pirivena Education, Special and Inclusive Education, Non – Formal Education and International School Education. The National Education Policy Framework (2020 – 2030) was formally submitted to the Minister of Education in June 2022 for forwarding to the President. This policy framework has now been accepted by the Ministry of Education as the basis for formulating the reforms to bring far – reaching reforms into the national education system.

We have to overcome the economic challenges and make Sri Lanka a developed nation,” Abeywardana said. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

In response, the Minister said animal feed prices are presently decreasing and will continue to fall in the future.

Wijesekara said this in Parliament in response to a question from MP Wimal Weerawansa. On a separate occasion, Wijesekara who said each power plant will be transformed into company to increase the efficiency emphasised that all the power plants will continue to be under the Government. Responding to questions raised by the Opposition as to whether there are plants to divide CEB into several companies, Wijesekara said no one should fight against the restructuring of CEB just because they were not able to restructure and stabilise the power sector. Wijesekara said that restructuring plan has to go ahead to ensure uninterrupted power supply. The loss by CEB by the end of December is expected to be Rs 152 billion, he stressed. He also said that some parties claim that CEB is currently enjoying an operational profit. He explained that it is because the thermal and furnace oil power generations were halted.

No doubt the art of filmmaking empowers women. At the beginning of a workshop, I observed a young Muslim girl, who was very shy to talk; reluctant to express her ideas and finding it difficult to confidently articulate her thoughts. However, when she was involved in filmmaking, I found her to be one of the exceptional talents in the team to provide art direction support. She could amazingly draw a storyboard. She had a unique ability to convert entire script to pictures. She organised the filming setting very creatively. Towards the end of the training, she was very confidently making suggestions and ideas,” Sumudu Malalagama, a short film director and a producer shared her observation after completing a four-day training workshop for female filmmakers in Batticaloa. The Centre for Media and Information Literacy (CMIL) conducted two mobile short film training programmes in Jaffna (24-27 November) and Batticaloa (1-4 December) to upskill 50 young female short film makers (26 from the North and 24 from the East) to use smartphones to produce compelling short films, addressing various human rights issues affecting women living in marginalised settings. The training programmes are organised under the initiative ‘Film for Equality’ and designed to enhance the capacity of the young women to use smartphones to produce compelling short films, capturing the lived realities of women in marginalised settings, and specifically focusing on how their human rights are systemically violated. Addressing GBV During both training programmes, young girls learnt how to produce short films to address issues such as economic inequality, GBV, climate injustice, digital misogyny, a lack of gender sensitivity, political and civic participation through mobile-based short filmmaking. The girls from Jaffna made a practice film on sexual harassment, where they discussed how young women are trapped by officials of the corporate and State institutions. Viewing the film, those girls maintained that a culture of zero tolerance is needed to eliminate sexual harassment. The girls collectively affirmed that fear of sexual harassment discourages women from discovering their own potential, achieving their goals, and fulfilling their aspirations. Thanushiya, a young filmmaker and university graduate said, “short films in Jaffna society has created a greater awareness amongst the young people on the rights of the LGBTQ community and the young girls. However, creating a culture of respect and recognition is a lifelong challenge.” She further said, “when girls remain in silence, it becomes extremely hard to create constant recognition for equality.”  They learnt how to shoot and edit video using freely available mobile applications such as KineMaster™. Each participant went through individualised training on developing emotionally powerful characters, story ideas, and converting them into meaningful films reflecting the voice of women. Breaking Silence “It is extremely vital for women to break their silence against gender-based violence (GBV) and human rights violations and continue to challenge the systemic oppression against women and young girls. One of the most effective ways to make this happen is to empower women to produce critical narratives articulating their lived realities,” said Ayesha Chathurangi, Lecturer at University of the Visual and Performing Arts. She made this point amongst young women short film makers from the Northern Province. When Ayesha said the majority of women are in greater silence against GBV, almost all the women in attendance endorsed it; many complemented her statement with their personal stories. Substantiating Ayesha’s statement, the majority of girls from the Northern Province said sexual bribery, sexual harassment on public transport, gender-based discrimination, cyber misogyny, and denying access to the public sphere, are some of the issues that they face in their daily life. Yet, most of the women do not speak out loud about their lived experience, in seeking justice. Rights to Safe Abortion The girls from the Eastern Province made two exercise films focusing on the right to marital consent of girls and right to safe abortion. Young girls were given the opportunity to contribute to the story development where they shared their personal experience in crafting their script.  Keshayini Edmond, a participant and short film maker directed the short film about the right to safe abortion, which highlighted stigma around safe abortion. Young girls indicated that some fathers and families dismantle the right of girls to choose a partner of their choice. Some girls said consent of young girls is not often valued when it comes to marriage. Prof. Indika Ferdinando, a national and international award-winning Sri Lankan theatre practitioner and film director and Sumudu Malalagama, film producer and director conducted the training programmes. The initiative ‘Film Incubator for Equality’ is supported by the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Colombo. During the training, those female short film makers shared their own insights on how GBV is systematically normalised too. Divya Rasathurai, a young female short film maker said, “when producing films on the lived reality of women, it is important to use metaphoric approaches and to engage the audience emotionally, intellectually, spiritually, and physically. Women should not be portrayed as powerless, helpless, voiceless and vulnerable individuals.” The same training programmes will be conducted in the Eastern and Southern provinces too. Under the ‘Film Incubator for Equality’ project, 76 young female filmmakers will be trained on promoting greater equality and gender justice. CMIL is working closely with the University of Jaffna, the University of Trincomalee campus, and The University of Visual and Performing Arts, Colombo, in designing a digital curriculum on filmmaking through smartphones and addressing human rights issues affecting women. The digital course will be available free of charge to all film enthusiasts in Sri Lanka."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

USAID representatives, during a discussion with Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera observed that in order to increase the efficiency in the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka, new agricultural technology should be resorted to instead of the use of traditional agricultural knowledge. Amaraweera noted during the discussion that Sri Lanka has found it difficult to reach self-sufficiency through the agricultural sector adding that to date certain crops that could be cultivated locally are being imported. While pledging support by providing advanced technology to overcome the difficulties faced in the agricultural sector, USAID pointed out that the current relationship between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Agrarian Development of Sri Lanka with farmers is weak, due to which farmers are not informed about the decisions and programs taken by the government, which is a serious problem for agricultural development. Thereby, USAID also pledged to provide all necessary support if both the departments prepare programmes to connect with farmers."

Thursday’s conversions are based on the value of the administered and benchmark official’spot’ fixed at Rs 363.18 to the US dollar on Monday and on the other two days at Rs 363.19 to the value, which was the fixed value of the official ‘spot’ on Thursday and Friday (3 & 4). Government of Sri Lanka’s (GoSL)face value money printing (FVMP) debt increased for the third consecutive market day to  yesterday, this time by 0.09 per cent (Rs 2,845 million) to Rs 3,265,661.05 million (Rs 3.2657 trillion)  due to a persistent lack of revenue. However, this increase was non-demand pull inflationary as it was used to meet the above external commitment.  GoSL’s at least theoretical MP borrowing costs (BCs) decreased for the third consecutive market day to yesterday, this time by 3.52 per cent ((Rs 4,637.04 million) to Rs 127,060.13 million due to continuous buying pressure of Treasury Bills and T Bonds in secondary market trading because of high yields offered by the same due to the twin reasons of GoSL’s huge borrowing appetite and uncertainty.  Market shortfall increased by 0.89 per cent (Rs 3,443 million) to Rs 391,029 million yesterday, thereby causing sustained rate pressure. Market was short for a record 306 market days to yesterday.   GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs three trillion for a record consecutive 106 market days to yesterday due to a persistent lack of revenue. GoSL’s highest to the 311th highest FVMP debt has been recorded in the 311 consecutive market days to yesterday. CBSL which administers daily open market operations (OMO) lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL.  GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot’. The ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and to lower the cost of energy imports which are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee as Sri Lanka is an import dependent economy.  Transactions between CBSL and GoSL are foreign reserves neutral.

The book is a timely addition to the discussion that needs to be undertaken on key issues relating to foreign policy and human rights that confront the country at present. The series of UNHRC resolutions on Sri Lanka are a direct outcome of this country’s inability to resolve its democracy and foreign policy challenges in a manner that meets the needs of its citizens. Authors in this volume include those from different professions, academics, journalists and political commentators. Some of the contributions can be mentioned to give a flavour of the topics and authors. There is Ambassador Dayantha Laksiri Mendis on ‘The application of human rights law and humanitarian law treaties in Sri Lanka and elsewhere’, Rohan Gunaratna on ‘Developing a balanced approach to national security in Sri Lanka’, lawyer Rajeev Amarasuriya on ‘Foreign policy perspectives, human rights and development in the new world order’, and journalist Shamindra Ferdinando on ‘Sri Lanka’s foreign policy dilemma’. As a diplomat who served in hotspot areas in the world including Israel, Ambassador Wijesinghe has had a vast exposure to diplomacy and its challenges. He has utilised his extensive network of contacts to obtain important contributions to this book. The Ambassadors’ Forum has maintained its impartiality and balance in dealing with current and timely topics without any affiliation, political or otherwise. Ambassador Wijesinghe’s drive to add more to the store of knowledge that would serve the country’s foreign policy-makers needs to be appreciated.   The Ambassadors’ Forum has contributed to the debate on the country’s foreign policy perspectives since the launch of the first volume in 2020 and thereafter the issue of seven volumes, namely Foreign Policy Perspectives for Sri Lanka in 2020, Foreign Policy Perspectives Port City Colombo and International Finance Centre, Foreign Policy Perspectives after Covid-19, Foreign Policy Perspectives Sri Lanka First, The Geneva Crisis the Way Forward, Peace and Reconciliation, and Promoting Tourism, Employment, Investment, Agriculture, Foreign Policy and Education. It is to the credit of the Ambassadors’ Forum and Ambassador Wijesinghe that eight volumes have been published within a space of two years.   Ambassador Wijesinghe also needs to be congratulated for having mobilised editors, sub editors, trainees, and many others who assisted in various ways in the publication of the series. At a time when Sri Lanka needs international support and solidarity, the Ambassadors’ Forum has stepped forward to give the country a better chance. Their services, and offers to serve, need to be utilised in the national interest. The present volume will be launched on 9 December at the OPA Auditorium to coincide with International Human Rights Day. The Ambassadors’ Forum invites its readers, well-wishers and friendly groups to register for the event by contacting 0777 880166 or by emailing <[email protected]>"

No doubt the art of filmmaking empowers women. At the beginning of a workshop, I observed a young Muslim girl, who was very shy to talk; reluctant to express her ideas and finding it difficult to confidently articulate her thoughts. However, when she was involved in filmmaking, I found her to be one of the exceptional talents in the team to provide art direction support. She could amazingly draw a storyboard. She had a unique ability to convert entire script to pictures. She organised the filming setting very creatively. Towards the end of the training, she was very confidently making suggestions and ideas,” Sumudu Malalagama, a short film director and a producer shared her observation after completing a four-day training workshop for female filmmakers in Batticaloa. The Centre for Media and Information Literacy (CMIL) conducted two mobile short film training programmes in Jaffna (24-27 November) and Batticaloa (1-4 December) to upskill 50 young female short film makers (26 from the North and 24 from the East) to use smartphones to produce compelling short films, addressing various human rights issues affecting women living in marginalised settings. The training programmes are organised under the initiative ‘Film for Equality’ and designed to enhance the capacity of the young women to use smartphones to produce compelling short films, capturing the lived realities of women in marginalised settings, and specifically focusing on how their human rights are systemically violated. Addressing GBV During both training programmes, young girls learnt how to produce short films to address issues such as economic inequality, GBV, climate injustice, digital misogyny, a lack of gender sensitivity, political and civic participation through mobile-based short filmmaking. The girls from Jaffna made a practice film on sexual harassment, where they discussed how young women are trapped by officials of the corporate and State institutions. Viewing the film, those girls maintained that a culture of zero tolerance is needed to eliminate sexual harassment. The girls collectively affirmed that fear of sexual harassment discourages women from discovering their own potential, achieving their goals, and fulfilling their aspirations. Thanushiya, a young filmmaker and university graduate said, “short films in Jaffna society has created a greater awareness amongst the young people on the rights of the LGBTQ community and the young girls. However, creating a culture of respect and recognition is a lifelong challenge.” She further said, “when girls remain in silence, it becomes extremely hard to create constant recognition for equality.”  They learnt how to shoot and edit video using freely available mobile applications such as KineMaster™. Each participant went through individualised training on developing emotionally powerful characters, story ideas, and converting them into meaningful films reflecting the voice of women. Breaking Silence “It is extremely vital for women to break their silence against gender-based violence (GBV) and human rights violations and continue to challenge the systemic oppression against women and young girls. One of the most effective ways to make this happen is to empower women to produce critical narratives articulating their lived realities,” said Ayesha Chathurangi, Lecturer at University of the Visual and Performing Arts. She made this point amongst young women short film makers from the Northern Province. When Ayesha said the majority of women are in greater silence against GBV, almost all the women in attendance endorsed it; many complemented her statement with their personal stories. Substantiating Ayesha’s statement, the majority of girls from the Northern Province said sexual bribery, sexual harassment on public transport, gender-based discrimination, cyber misogyny, and denying access to the public sphere, are some of the issues that they face in their daily life. Yet, most of the women do not speak out loud about their lived experience, in seeking justice. Rights to Safe Abortion The girls from the Eastern Province made two exercise films focusing on the right to marital consent of girls and right to safe abortion. Young girls were given the opportunity to contribute to the story development where they shared their personal experience in crafting their script.  Keshayini Edmond, a participant and short film maker directed the short film about the right to safe abortion, which highlighted stigma around safe abortion. Young girls indicated that some fathers and families dismantle the right of girls to choose a partner of their choice. Some girls said consent of young girls is not often valued when it comes to marriage. Prof. Indika Ferdinando, a national and international award-winning Sri Lankan theatre practitioner and film director and Sumudu Malalagama, film producer and director conducted the training programmes. The initiative ‘Film Incubator for Equality’ is supported by the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Colombo. During the training, those female short film makers shared their own insights on how GBV is systematically normalised too. Divya Rasathurai, a young female short film maker said, “when producing films on the lived reality of women, it is important to use metaphoric approaches and to engage the audience emotionally, intellectually, spiritually, and physically. Women should not be portrayed as powerless, helpless, voiceless and vulnerable individuals.” The same training programmes will be conducted in the Eastern and Southern provinces too. Under the ‘Film Incubator for Equality’ project, 76 young female filmmakers will be trained on promoting greater equality and gender justice. CMIL is working closely with the University of Jaffna, the University of Trincomalee campus, and The University of Visual and Performing Arts, Colombo, in designing a digital curriculum on filmmaking through smartphones and addressing human rights issues affecting women. The digital course will be available free of charge to all film enthusiasts in Sri Lanka."

Wijeratne also stated that though the diesel price has been reduced, they do not plan on reducing bus fares. “Only 1.1 per cent of relief has been provided from the Rs 10 price reduction of fuel. Therefore, they cannot expect us to reduce the bus fares following such small concessions,” he added. He stated that between 35 and 40 per cent of the daily income from buses is spent on fuel and money has to be allocated for maintenance. “The prices of spare parts and service activities have increased three to four fold.

He accused the Government and Police of failing to take action against the dangerous drug mafia operating within one of the country’s primary tertiary care institutions. Although NHSL authorities followed lenient measures during the Covid-19 pandemic with regard to attendance, now the situation has changed. The Hospital was worried that they will not be able to deal with the present situation. Some employees amongst them had found second jobs for which they were being remunerated, he alleged, noting that some of these jobs included drug trafficking, it had resulted in alleged thefts taking place inside hospital wards and the car park. Health staff complained on numerous occasions of parts of their vehicles being stolen while inside the hospital patients lose their belongings. Unfortunately, the authorities also have their hands tied as no action can be taken without incurring the wrath of the trade unions which were allegedly “paid to go on pickets and other forms of trade union action” in the face of disciplinary action being taken against the erring minor employees, the GMOF President accused.   He accused the Police of allegedly turning a blind eye to the situation at NHSL. The Hospital came under the purview of the Maradana and Borella Police stations. The hospital has been unable to bring either of the two law enforcing authorities down to discuss the issue and formulate a control plan due to the lethargic attitude shown by them. The GMOF President lambasted the Government for permitting five per cent of the health staff at the hospital to control and influence 95 per cent of the persons including patients who most often came from the peripheries and had to endure mental pain as well as physical pain as a result.  Meanwhile, responding to allegations, General Secretary of the Joint Health Workers’ Union (JHWU), Ven. Tempitiye Sugathananda Thera said his outfit had discussed the accusations levelled against minor employees of the hospital with the Hospital Director and warned that they would be forced to resort to trade union action against Dr. Bellana who was the Deputy Director. “We have no issues if he in his capacity as a medical administrator took disciplinary action against any of the minor employees engaged in theft, addiction to dangerous drugs or was engaged in the sale of it,” he said. But in this case the Deputy Director of the Hospital was only abusing his power by plucking mobile phones from minor employees and using abusive language, he accused. “Further, dangerous substances arrive in the country either by air or by sea. But none of the minor employees at NHSL have any contact with any of the dealers or anyone in the Air Force or Navy for that matter to be able to even have vague access to any of these substances,” he added. The Ven. Thera said he had been at the NHSL the whole of yesterday (7) and that a motorbike and a three-wheeler had been stolen. The thieves were nabbed and handed over to the Deputy Director. The Thera accused the GMOF President of merely carrying out a media show instead of doing his duty and taking disciplinary action. “It is obvious that he is the cat’s paw for the Government to carry out a coup so that health service employees could be slashed to keep up with the demands of the IMF,” he further said.

The committee made these remarks during its meeting to examine the Auditor General’s reports and performance of the Western Provincial Road Development Authority for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Dr. Charitha Herath, who chaired the meeting, said although there were a large number of projects in the past period, road development projects have been reduced due to several factors including the dollar crisis. Therefore, if all these employees are hired on a permanent basis, they will have to pay their salaries from the Treasury money. Therefore, COPA members pointed out that it is necessary to look into the confirmation of employment for only the employees required and if there is excess labour, they should be compensated for and considered for removal. Dr. Herath recommended that a report be given to COPA within 3 months setting out the priority list of the number of employees according to requirement as there are only a few projects at the moment. It was disclosed that there are 396 employees on daily wage basis and 160 employees on contract basis. The officials pointed out that these employees are essential employees. It is said that several attempts were made to recruit these employees on a permanent basis and it could not be done due to several factors including changes in policies due to the change of government. These employees were recruited on project basis and were paid from the profits of those projects. It was also discussed that two concrete paving machines and a curb machine worth 6 million which were purchased at a cost of Rs 158 million in 2012 were still lying idle. The two concrete paving machines were used for only 420 hours from 2012 to November 2022 and the curb machine remained idle from 2012 until now. Thus, the officials pointed out that around 2011, road concreting was done on a large-scale and because of this, these machines were purchased in 2012. But after the purchase of these machines, the concrete paving of the roads gradually decreased and therefore the usefulness of these machines decreased. Therefore, they stated that given the present context, one of the two machines is sufficient for them.

Imran urged President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the relevant authorities to consider setting up a new National College of Education in Trincomalee District. This will facilitate a large number of Sinhala and Tamil medium students who will enter the teaching profession in the future, MP Imran said. MP Imran said this during a discussion with educationists and teachers in Kinniya on Sunday (4). “The main reason why Trincomalee District is seen as an educationally backward district is the shortage of teachers. If this issue is to be resolved, another college of education must be set up in the Trincomalee District as soon as possible. Sinhala medium schools in Morawala, Gomarankadawala, and Padavi Sripura will benefit immensely once this proposal is implemented,” MP Imran said. Trincomalee Town and Gravets Divisional Secretary have offered a 15-acre stretch in Trincomalee Sardharura area to set up the proposed College of Education. The subject Minister must take necessary action to set up this college as soon as possible. Taking this matter into consideration, new education zones must be established for Kuchchaveli and Mullipothana, Imran said. Muslim schools in Thambalagamuwa Divisional Secretariat Division have been affiliated with Kinniya Zonal Education Office while affiliating the Tamil and Sinhala schools with Trincomalee and Kantale zonal offices. Mullipothana Education Zone must be established in the manner of facilitating these schools. Once this zone is established, 30 schools including 16 Muslim schools, six Sinhala schools, and eight Tamil schools in the region will benefit, MP Imran added. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

Don’t connect with people who haven’t worked in the fisheries industry just to make money, hinted the MP. He said, “Instead of working with people who have no connection at all to the fishing trade, we should provide technical and commercial assistance to our fishermen who have a long history with the sea and the industry.” While addressing the group discussion regarding agriculture, fisheries, and irrigation sectors held yesterday (6), the MP further noted that self-sustenance of the country depends on not betraying the people who have been protecting the resources of the country for generations and helped build the economy for a long time, he added. “I want to tell the President of this country that such a short-term popular project will only give short-term income.” In this way, seafood needs of the local people can be met and the fishermen can get export profits. Please do not mortgage our marine resources in order for someone to profit entirely, lamented the MP. According to the MP, fishermen are concerned that the Ministry of Fisheries and institutions such as the National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA), which are supposed to work with them, are working against them. Fifty years ago, local traders in Jaffna caught, processed, and traded natural sea cucumbers without harming the marine environment or fishermen. However, they are in a trade of catching baby sea cucumbers, setting up farms, and artificially breeding them. If this practice is allowed to continue, it has the potential to deplete the natural resources available to fishermen, he said. He also added that fishermen of Ilavankudah, in Kiranji area have been protesting continuously for 70 days. The Jaffna District Seafood Co-operative Societies Federation is fighting to remove the 50-acre sea cucumber farm set up in Parutthithivu near Analaithivu Island. “But cases have been filed against those who are protesting and they are falsifying the cases against the fishermen who are fighting for their livelihood rights and taking revenge is the highest level of politics that is continuing to this date,” he added. He said the Government should probe the sea cucumber issue. “Our people do not eat sea cucumber, but catching the fish they eat poses significant challenges, such as Indian trawlers invading our sea and destroying their livelihood, and now the sea cucumber business is eating into the profits of Northern fishermen,” he added. He added that the fishermen had been duped once again. Because of the dollars generated by sea cucumber exports, people are being forced to import even the fish they eat and the fishermen are polarised over this, he said. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Don’t connect with people who haven’t worked in the fisheries industry just to make money, hinted the MP. He said, “Instead of working with people who have no connection at all to the fishing trade, we should provide technical and commercial assistance to our fishermen who have a long history with the sea and the industry.” While addressing the group discussion regarding agriculture, fisheries, and irrigation sectors held yesterday (6), the MP further noted that self-sustenance of the country depends on not betraying the people who have been protecting the resources of the country for generations and helped build the economy for a long time, he added. “I want to tell the President of this country that such a short-term popular project will only give short-term income.” In this way, seafood needs of the local people can be met and the fishermen can get export profits. Please do not mortgage our marine resources in order for someone to profit entirely, lamented the MP. According to the MP, fishermen are concerned that the Ministry of Fisheries and institutions such as the National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA), which are supposed to work with them, are working against them. Fifty years ago, local traders in Jaffna caught, processed, and traded natural sea cucumbers without harming the marine environment or fishermen. However, they are in a trade of catching baby sea cucumbers, setting up farms, and artificially breeding them. If this practice is allowed to continue, it has the potential to deplete the natural resources available to fishermen, he said. He also added that fishermen of Ilavankudah, in Kiranji area have been protesting continuously for 70 days. The Jaffna District Seafood Co-operative Societies Federation is fighting to remove the 50-acre sea cucumber farm set up in Parutthithivu near Analaithivu Island. “But cases have been filed against those who are protesting and they are falsifying the cases against the fishermen who are fighting for their livelihood rights and taking revenge is the highest level of politics that is continuing to this date,” he added. He said the Government should probe the sea cucumber issue. “Our people do not eat sea cucumber, but catching the fish they eat poses significant challenges, such as Indian trawlers invading our sea and destroying their livelihood, and now the sea cucumber business is eating into the profits of Northern fishermen,” he added. He added that the fishermen had been duped once again. Because of the dollars generated by sea cucumber exports, people are being forced to import even the fish they eat and the fishermen are polarised over this, he said. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Minister said the report presented to Cabinet only outlines the losses incurred by the CEB over the past years and the financial assistance offered by the Treasury to help the CEB. Wijesekera emphasised that he has proposed electricity tariff hikes under two stages next year to ensure uninterrupted power supply. “We requested the CEB to provide a continuous power supply in 2023 and the CEB pointed out that there might be a drought next year. They said there might be reduction in rain and that would lead to the reduction in hydropower generation,” he said. Therefore, CEB calculated that Rs 59.60 will be required for the generation of one power unit and over 17,000 GW in total is required for next year, the Minister said.

The Chief Magistrate gave his approval, following a request made to him by Keselwatta Police, who sought to transfer the probe to the CID. OIC of the Keselwatta Police, Chief Inspector Bamunusinghe, stated that they had commenced initial inquiries into the incident following lodged by the Registrar of the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court. The OIC stated that as per the complaint, 48.5 sovereigns of gold items, weighing 388.43 g, which had been kept in the Court Productions Room No.4, had been taken away having submitted fake documents to Court. According to the complaint, a Constable attached to the CID had removed the gold items from the Court Productions Room, having furnished bogus documents to Court, on the pretext of submitting it to the National Gem and Jewellery Authority. These details had come to light, when perusing documents where an order had been issued by the Court, concerning gold items weighing 79 sovereigns, which had been ordered to be released to its owner, related to a lawsuit concerning the Maligawatta Police. The complaint had further mentioned that an individual posing as a CID Constable, had also removed a few other Court Productions from the Borella Police Station too on 23 November, after having produced fake documents to Court. Keselwatta Police informed Chief Magistrate Amerasinghe, that the theft had been brought to the notice of the Court Registrar, by the temporary guard of the Court Productions Room Mohammad Niyaz, after which the Registrar had lodged the complaint with the Police. They added that following initial inquiries conducted into the theft, it had come to light that the Provisions contained in Sections 402, 454 and 386 of the Penal Code, had been flouted and hence they urged the Court, to hand over the entire probe of the case to the CID.   By Hansi Nanayakkara"

In total, we’ve announced over $240 million in new assistance and additional loans for small businesses over the last year, – and we’ll keep at it. Assistance like today’s fertiliser demonstrates America’s goodwill and true commitment to the people of Sri Lanka.” Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera said Sri Lankan paddy farmers are capable of feeding the country, and we are working to ensure that they have the inputs needed to support their livelihood and strengthen the food security of the country. “We thank the US Government and the FAO for their support in ensuring that vulnerable farmers receive essential fertiliser free of charge,” he said The United States, through USAID, has provided $46 million in funding to procure essential fertiliser to increase paddy production and avert a food crisis – a portion of which arrived yesterday. This funding will also provide cash assistance to small-holder farmers who have suffered due to low yields over the last two agricultural seasons and on account of the prevailing economic crisis. USAID and its partners have mechanisms in place to monitor and evaluate their work, ensuring that assistance reaches its intended recipients and benefits the vulnerable farming households.    “We are delivering on a commitment we made to reach small-holder paddy farmers with much-needed fertiliser during the planting season to increase their yield and harvests. This is part of our support to Sri Lankans during this complex emergency to ensure they lead healthier and more productive lives,” said Änjali Kaur, USAID’s Deputy Assistant Administrator of the Asia Bureau who is currently visiting Sri Lanka. “At FAO, we believe that saving livelihoods saves lives. The 9,300 tonnes of Urea, procured through USAID, will ensure smallholder farmers take to productive agriculture practices and are able to meet their food and nutrition requirements in these extremely difficult days the country faces. We thank the US Government for its support in this endeavour and look forward to working with USAID in taking Sri Lankan agriculture forward,” stated Vimlendra Sharan, Country Director of FAO.  Today’s handing over ceremony was attended by the United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung; Sri Lanka’s Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera, USAID’s Deputy Assistant Administrator for Asia, Anjali Kaur; FAO Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Vimlendra Sharan and USAID Mission Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives, Gabriel Grau."

LakKumar Fernando and R. Gnanasekeram yesterday (5), they urged President Ranil Wickramesinghe and the government to seriously review the alleged measures taken to prevent medical practitioners from leaving the country. The duo alleged that in his speech on 29 November 2022, Minister Rambukwella had said that the Government was to request foreign diplomatic missions to refrain from issuing visas to doctors in the State service, who were attempting to leave the country for employment purposes sans approved leave. “The exodus of all categories of State health services became inevitable with the current economic crisis,” they said observing that their outfit agreed that any government employee leaving the country without approval was in violation of the Establishments Code. It needs to be dealt with accordingly by serving the particular employee with a vacation of post and recovering the bond money, if there was any. Lashing out, Drs Fernando and Gnanasekeram alleged that the Health Minister’s statement implied that the government was purportedly targeting only medical specialists leaving aside many other health professionals, which “violated the fundamental right to equality provided by Article 12 of the Constitution of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.”  His statement also violated article 14(1) (h) and 14(1) (i) of the Constitution which guaranteed freedom of movement and freedom of returning to Sri Lanka to all citizens, they accused. They urged the Health Minister to streamline and attend to any foreign leave and resignation approval processes without undue delay, rather than humiliating and harassing the medical specialists.  “We noted that the Minister also stated that among other steps to discourage medical staff leaving the country without authorisation, the airport will also be informed not to allow them to leave the country, if they do not have approved leave. It is deeply shocking that the government was attempting to defame medical practitioners like “terrorists and criminals at airports and foreign missions.” The duo lashed out.  They accused the Minister of also having   said that the licences (registrations) given to doctors by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) would be cancelled. The duo said that it amounted to an arbitrary usurpation of the authority of the SLMC which looked after patient welfare with equitable medical governance. The Minister also warned at the time that doctors who leave the country without approved leave would be blacklisted. The AMS consider these overwhelming reactions as atrocious and devastating acts against the reputation of Sri Lankan medical practitioners in the international arena and seriously breached their professional dignity and the fundamental rights, the AMS President and Secretary added.  (DJ)"

During an inspection visit of the area, those who sold kidneys told Ceylon Today that brokers approach young people from poverty stricken families in secret, promising to pay Rs 300,000 – Rs 500,000 for a kidney. The people who live in estates tend to sell kidneys owing to poverty. Although they were promised money and medical care for the rest of their lives, after selling the kidneys, they were being ghosted. The brokers who get colossal sums of money only give a very small amount to the people and then ghost them, the victims said. One person told Ceylon Today that he sold his kidney as his family did not have a proper place to live. “The broker told me that I can sell kidney. We did not have a proper place to live. We did not even have a toilet. So I agreed to the deal. But my wife was against that. The broker promisedRs 500,000 and then we signed an agreement. After the surgery he gave money after taking me home following the surgery. “Sometimes I think I should not have sold the kidney. But now my family have a proper place to live. I cannot do any work because I get exhausted easily. I cannot walk for long and I cannot even wash clothes,” he said. Another person said he was not provided medical care as promised after the surgery. “My house was mortgaged and my wife got burnt in a fire. That was when a broker came and asked me whether I liked to sell a kidney for Rs 500,000. But I only received Rs 400,000.  Although I was taken to Colombo by a vehicle, they did not even provide transport to come home after the surgery. They only dropped me at the Pettah bus stand. The surgical wound was infected after a few days.” Ceylon Today learns that two persons who sold kidneys like this have already died. About 100 persons in the area have sold kidneys and health conditions of majority of them have deteriorated. When queried from Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sri Chandragupta as to whether the ministry is aware of a kidney racket in Ukuwela, he said he is not aware of that. Chandaraguptha said, there isn’t sufficient evidence on the alleged kidney racket reported in Colombo and if there is evidence the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) has the necessary powers to take actions against it. The DGHS has been already informed to look into the matter, he said. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has appointed a seven-member committee to probe the alleged kidney racket at Western Infirmary Hospital in Borella. DGHS Dr. Asela Gunawardena said, the committee was appointed following instructions from Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella. Kidney transplant surgeries at the said hospital have been suspended until the investigation is concluded, Dr. Gunawardena said. BY K.K. Ariyadasa and Vineetha M. Gamage Popular"

Addressing the ‘Nidhahas Aragalaya – Mathin Thora Deshayak,’ the NATA’s advocacy programme for Sri Lankan media personnel (Media Awards Ceremony) aimed at appreciating their contribution towards tobacco and alcohol prevention in the country, its Chairman Dr. Samadhi Rajapaksa claimed that the tobacco industry is behind the campaign to legalise cannabis. “There is a 6 per cent reduction in smoking tobacco consumption in Sri Lanka in 2022, if this continues in every country their industry will collapse.  Canada is the country which majorly started with nine factories to manufacture cannabis, but now they are facing a huge loss where all these factories have been closed. Even Lebanon is facing the same situation. If someone is trying to say that there is a huge market for cannabis because of its medical use that’s false. Worldwide research on cannabis-based medications have produced unexpected results.  There’s only one medicine which was used for epilepsy patients, yet in a very minimal quantity. Even if we collect the cannabis found illegally, we have a surplus,” he added. Rajapaksa further claimed that even when it comes to indigenous medicines, they have scientific evidence that cannabis wasn’t used in large quantities. “Indigenous doctors say they use oil or king coconut water to get rid of the poisonous aspect of cannabis even when using the slightest amount of it for certain medicines. We argue with scientifically proven facts, unlike some people who act on assumptions,” he said.

He said innovative solutions are required to overcome these future challenges. “Although we have more knowledge than other countries, because we lack a process to put that knowledge into practice, other countries take advantage of our human resources. The loss of focus of those in charge of the country’s economy has had a significant impact on that human resource. We must urgently recall Sri Lankan human resources, who are dispersed worldwide and equipped with knowledge, in order to pursue the fourth industrial revolution, which we are missing, and bridge the gap that is far away. This should help to shape the country’s future. To that end, the attention and support of this country’s economists should be focused on knowledge and technology,” he said.

He also alleged that a worker named ‘Siva Kumar,’ a father of three, had been subjected to electric shocks during work hours, suffered third-degree burns, and is in critical condition at the Kandy Hospital. Workers are perturbed over this incident. Thondaman further alleged workers are not allowed to unionise to talk about their rights and not allowed to subscribe to a Union of their choice. He said the employer must recognise their rights as per the TU Ordinance. “Due to management irregularities and the refusal by the company to discuss matters pertaining to the well-being of workers, I initiated TU action against them,” Thondaman said. “The company belonging to the richest person in the country, has not only stopped work for the workers during this crisis, but has filed cases against estate workers and their children in Hatton,  Norwood, and Maskeliya Police stations for engaging in TU action,” he alleged.  Thondaman told the Police that they cannot interfere in TU action, and he, as the CWC General Secretary had ordered this action. “While the President had encouraged abandoned lands to be given for cultivation to people who are at risk of food insecurity, the management had forcibly destroyed cultivated lands belonging to unemployed youth in the estate with the help of the Police,” he further alleged. The management had sought the help of the CID special branch to intimidate the workers into ending the TU action by threatening them with six months imprisonment, according to Thondaman. “The plantation managers believe in an authoritarian form of management. While the company paints a pretty picture on the outside to show ‘ethical’ plucking, nothing could be further from the truth. The company controls Talawakelle, Kelani Valley, and Horana Plantations. While the owner entered Parliament in a supposed bid to save the country, it’ll be nice if the public could see the state of the people in his plantations,” claimed Thondaman. Workers who have worked for over 180 days haven’t been registered, he pointed out. Setting high norms at 20 kg and violating the Wages Board Ordinance by paying people only 500 if a kilo is plucked less. If a worker works for 8 hours, he/she must be paid Rs 1,000 as wage, he added. To clarify, if a worker plucks 21 kg, 3 kg is deducted per weigh in for various irrational reasons, thereby reducing the worker’s output to 18 kg. Moreover, the infamous Outgrower system of management proposed by them has never proven to benefit the estate worker. In fact, they are further subjugated into untold obligations and uncertainties. Workers are at risk of getting paid less for green leaves plucked and the management will remove the plots given to the workers at their discretion, he said. The living standards are in a pathetic state, not because of politicians and unions, but because the management believes that not even a toilet should be built in the line rooms. “If what I claim is false, I’d be more than happy to take anyone into the plantations managed by them and expose them for what they truly are,” Thondaman stressed.

He said they are waiting for the Ceylon Electricity Board to forward the request to increase the electricity tariff, after which they will provide their solution. Addressing the media yesterday (1), Ratnayake said increasing the electricity tariff should be done methodically rather than haphazardly. “If this does not happen methodically, the electricity prices will be increased at random, just like the price of fuel, and people will find out when they wake up. We disagree because it cannot be done in this manner.” That is why we are requesting permission to import naphtha and furnace oil, as well as coal. “Everything in the global market has decreased,” he said. In addition, he noted that they previously advised that if the electricity board has the ability to import furnace oil and naphtha like coal, the Rs. 400 billion cost can be reduced by another Rs. 200 billion,” he said.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

When the case came up before Colombo District Judge Poornima Gamage, the Consul General of Hungary Rohana Nanayakkara filed his Answer through his Attorney-at-Law G. G.

In his Answer it has been stated that the Office of the Consul General of Hungary in Sri Lanka is situated at the premises bearing Assessment No. 288/12/L, Sri Jayawardenapura Mawatha, Fifth Lane, Royal Gardens, Rajagiriya and the said property is owned by Ceylon Carriers Pvt.

Issuing a special statement in this regard, yesterday (1) Ranjith Vithanage, President of NMCRP said that it has been proposed to increase the electricity bill on the first of January 2023 and again in June 2023 in the background of the electricity bill being revised in August 2022. Vithanage points out that if the Electricity Board wants to make an amendment to the electricity bill, the relevant proposal should first be submitted to the Public Utilities Commission ofSri Lanka (PUCSL) then the necessary calculations should be made and the public opinion should be sought and the electricity bill amended. He says that this proposal has been submitted to the Cabinet in violation of the provisions of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009, Section 30. He states that it is unfair and illegal to impose the loss on the consumer due to the careless control and fraud of the electricity board. Vithanage said it is ridiculous to increase the electricity bill while the government has announced that it expects a large economic growth rate in the year 2023. He further said the electricity consumer expects the Minister to get electricity at a reasonable rate and requested the government to withdraw the proposal to increase the electricity rates presented to the Cabinet.

Ltd. (2nd Defendant) and another, alleging that the Defendants in this case on or about 20 September 2022 made an attempt illegally and wrongfully to construct a roller gate obstructing the residents entering into the Royal Gardens Housing Complex and obtained an ex-parte enjoining order restraining the Defendants from disturbing and/ or interfering with the Plaintiff’s right to access over the right of way to a certain allotment of land and/or constructing a roller gate obstructing the same right of way situated at Royal Gardens, Rajagiriya. When the case came up before Colombo District Judge Poornima Gamage, the Consul General of Hungary Rohana Nanayakkara filed his Answer through his Attorney-at-Law G. G. Arulpragasam claiming one billion rupees in damages. In his Answer it has been stated that the Office of the Consul General of Hungary in Sri Lanka is situated at the premises bearing Assessment No. 288/12/L, Sri Jayawardenapura Mawatha, Fifth Lane, Royal Gardens, Rajagiriya and the said property is owned by Ceylon Carriers Pvt. Ltd. (2nd Defendant) and the Consul General of Hungary is the tenant of the said premises. Rohana Nanayakkara is the Honorary Consul General of Hungary in Sri Lanka and has been appointed as such by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Hungary and the said appointment had been subsequently approved by the President of Sri Lanka in 1993. It has been further stated that Rohana Nanayakkara has been recognised for all the charitable and international achievements obtained by him as the Honorary Consul of Hungary in Sri Lanka since 1993. In his Answer Rohana Nanayakkara, the Consul General of Hungary, has further stated that this action was instituted by Captain Anil Jayasinghe representing the interest of a purported unincorporated Association by the name of ‘Royal Gardens Resident’s Association’ and Captain Anil Jayasinghe has failed to comply with Section 16 of the Civil Procedure Code and thereby the said cause of action cannot stand in law and should be dismissed in limine. Rohana Nanayakkara, the Consul General of Hungary has further claimed in his Answer that the Office of the Honorary Consul of Hungary is disrupted by Captain Anil Jayasinghe and the Royal Gardens Resident’s Association by a rear gate installed across certain allotments of land which directly corners the Office of the Consul General towards one entrance and exit. Moreover, he has stated that the association to which the Captain Anil Jayasinghe is the secretary has never given him keys to the rear gate and since the Office of the Honorary Consul General is left with only one entrance and exit, it has renovated the gate towards the entrance of its allotment of land for the benefit of all residents of the Royal Gardens. It is the position of Rohana Nanayakkara, the Consul General of Hungary that Captain Anil Jayasinghe has maliciously instituted this action to disrupt and disengage the official work of the Office of the Consul General of Hungary and to cause as much damage and humiliation to the said office. In response to the action filed by Captain Anil Jayasinghe,. Rohana Nanayakkara, the Consul General of Hungary, has set out a Claim in Reconvention on the basis that Captain Anil Jayasinghe has instituted the instant action by suppression and misrepresentation of fact, with malicious intent to harm the reputation of Rohana Nanayakkara, the Consul General of Hungary, and without a valid cause of action against him.

The figure was above the “often-quoted 10 to 15 per cent figures,” the study said, adding a “significant portion” of the country’s debt to China had been recorded under lending to State-Owned Enterprises rather than Central Government. Crisis-hit Sri Lanka is in the midst of a debt restructuring after years of economic mismanagement combined with the Covid-19 pandemic saw the country plunge into the worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948 and tip into default. Export-Import Bank of China (Exim Bank) and China Development Bank are the two largest Chinese lenders, accounting for USD 4.3 billion and USD 3 billion respectively, according to the data collected by CARI at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. China is Sri Lanka’s largest bilateral creditor and, with India and Japan, part of official creditor talks to restructure the country’s debt. “China will have to play a major role in Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring process,” CARI researchers Umesh Moramudali and Thilina Panduwawala wrote in the report. The island nation kicked off talks with bilateral creditors in September after securing a Staff Level Agreement of USD 2.9 billion with the International Monetary Fund. But financing will not flow until the fund’s board approves the deal, a step that requires financial assurances from bilateral lenders. The latest talks initially expected earlier this month were postponed, casting doubt over how fast the debt rework can progress. The island nation’s total external debt is USD 37.6 billion, according to the report. Adding central bank foreign currency debt, including a USD 1.6 billion currency swap with China, public external debt rises to USD 40.6 billion, of which 22 per cent is from Chinese creditors. CARI’s total debt numbers differ from the USD 46.6 billion tally published by the Government in September as it excludes local hard-currency debt and loans to some State-owned enterprises. The CARI study also identified six different loans to the deep water port in Hambantota from Exim Bank between 2007 and 2013 for around USD 1.3 billion. The loan agreements have clauses that “submit the loans to Chinese governing law and arbitration before the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission.” (Reuters)"

Speaking to the media at the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB), Consultant Dermatologist Anti Leprosy Campaign, Dr. Indira Kahawita yesterday (30) said out of the total leprosy cases detected this year, 14 per cent were children below 14 years. Sri Lanka presently has the highest number of children who have been diagnosed with leprosy while the rest of the world has only 4.8 per cent children diagnosed with leprosy. Fielding questions, Dr. Kahawita said statistics should be brought down to ‘zero’ if the slow-growing Mycobacterial disease was to be controlled in the country. Leprosy was controlled in the island in 1995. However, the slowed down progress of the detection rate within the past two years led to an increase of the number of undiagnosed cases this year. Only 10 per cent of the newly detected cases were children in 2020 and 2021, she said.  “If Sri Lanka was to keep with the guidelines for leprosy eradication given by the World Health Organization (WHO) and bring the disease under control once more, the number of child cases should be zeroed,” Dr. Kahawita explained, adding that this would be a challenge to the ALC, as it could not give a set time period during which this could be achieved. However, if the spread is to be controlled, the detection and awareness process should be boosted, Dr. Kahawita added. Director of the ALC, Dr. Prasad Ranaweera said, from January till date the Campaign had had been able to detect 1,200 new cases – 459 cases during the first seven months of this year and another 750 within the last three months due to its extensive awareness campaigns. He said in 2020 a total 1,200 cases had been diagnosed while last year 1,016 cases had been diagnosed with the disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

It is absolutely the wrong picture.

GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL. GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot.’ The ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and to lower the cost of energy imports which are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee, as Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy. Transactions between CBSL and GoSL are foreign reserves-neutral. By Paneetha Ameresekere"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts.

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

Accordingly, foreign missions in Colombo have been requested not to grant visas to doctors if they do not have permission from the Health Ministry to go overseas and Immigration Officers at the airport have been instructed to check whether doctors who travel overseas have applied for leave. President Ranil Wickremesinghe said a solution is needed to address the exodus of doctors and engineers. “The Government spends Rs 6 million on each medical student.  This much of money is being spent with the intention of getting their services for the country, but instead they migrate. This has become a serious issue. We have to find a solution, as this has been ongoing for many years,” the President said. “In that case, we have provided far greater aid to those countries than the aid these countries provide us with,” he added. Meanwhile, Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella, who said around 300 doctors have left the country since January this year, warned there is a possibility of the Sri Lankan health sector collapsing as a result. Rambukwella in response to a question of Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, said the ministry gives permission to doctors to work overseas only for five years. Doctors who travel overseas without permission will be blacklisted and their licences issued by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) will be revoked, so that they will not be able to practice medicine abroad.

The Minister observed it was up to the University Grants Commission (UGC) to decide the precise number of times that the students should be allowed to sit for examinations. Premajayantha added that due to actions of certain students who tend to spend years in the university system without sitting for examinations, the opportunity for new enrolments has been seriously curtailed. Hence, the Minister remarked that the onus was on students to sit for their requisite examinations on time and then serve the country via their chosen streams rather than wasting their time by joining trade unions.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Indian CEO Forum stepping in to assist and partner with the Colombo Rowing Club for this event is a clear example of how the neighbors encourage and support each other. “The Indian CEO Forum along with two other member companies — Lanka IOC and Power Tech Cement — have come forward to sponsor this exclusive event and make it a success. This is a great boost for rowing in Sri Lanka, especially at a time the country is trying its level best to regain glory in all aspects,” said President of the Rowing Club, Dimuth Gunawardena. “I am extremely thankful to Mr T.S. Prakash and Mr Kishore Reddy along with Mr Nagaraj who made this happen,” Gunawardena added. T.S. Prakash, president of the ICF said, “We are really happy that we associated with this event and member companies are extremely happy that such a partnership was established.” Kishore Reddy, the Vice President and Chairman membership of the ICF as well as the President of the Sri Lanka India Society said, “The Madras-Colombo Regatta has immense potential to be a permanent feature of the sporting calendar considering the history of the event and the traditions associated with it. We will work together with the Colombo Rowing Club to take this to the next level”. “We are glad to be the sponsors of the event and were not really aware of an event with such history before Mr. Kishore Reddy mentioned it,” said Manoj Gupta, the Managing Director of the Lanka IOC. “We look forward to supporting the Colombo Rowing Club for the next event as well,” said Gupta. Gaurav Mehta, the Managing Director of DHT cement and Power Tech Cement who were also the sponsors of the event mentioned, “We are happy that the newest brand of cement in Sri Lanka (Power Tech) has partnered with the oldest Regatta in the world. The event exceeded my expectation and we are proud that we are part of this and contributed to the success of the event”. Sagala Ratnayake, the guest of honour and also a past Oarsman who had rowed many times at the venue said, he is happy to see the partnership between the ICF and the Rowing Club. The first-ever Madras-Colombo Rowing Regatta was held way back in 1898 and is considered the oldest sporting encounter held between India and Sri Lanka. This time, the rivalry resumed after a break of three years due to the pandemic. Traditionally, the Madras Boat Club and the Colombo Rowing Club host the Regatta alternatively and this year it was the Colombo Rowing Club’s turn to host the Indian team. “We are extremely thankful to the Colombo Rowing Club for hosting us and for their great hospitality,” said President of the Madras Boat Club, Subramanium. “We will also try our best to match this hospitality, if not exceed when we host this event next year,” he added. The main event of the Regatta is the Men’s boat race, which is considered to be the second oldest boat race in the world, second only to the famous Oxford-Cambridge boat race. The events were for men and women over a distance of 1,000 metres. The winners of the Men’s event were Colombo and were awarded the prestigious Deepam Trophy while the Adyar Trophy was awarded to the Madras team who were the Women’s champions. The overall champions of the 81st Madras Colombo Regatta was COLOMBO."

He said, the Norochcholai Power Plant provides between 40% and 50% of the National Electricity requirement to the national power grid. He noted that the Ceylon Coal Company prepares the quantity of coal required for this purpose in approximately 38 shipments every season, when coal is required.

According to the statement, the initial payments have already been made. Sumanasekara said, while purchasing coal was difficult this time, unloading of 35 shipments have begun. He claimed that because the previous three tenders called to obtain long-term credit facilities did not meet the requirements of the objectives expected, the Cabinet of Ministers approved 12 new shipments (720000MT) from uncalled proposals. “The deadline for submitting proposals is 1 December. All suppliers who have written and agreed with Lanka Coal Company, all suppliers who have received bid documents for subsequent tenders, all suppliers who have submitted unsolicited proposals, and any suppliers who are willing to participate are invited to join,” he said.

The ‘Freedom Convoy’ demonstrations against public health measures including vaccine mandates shut down Ottawa and blocked some border crossings for weeks in January and February. Trudeau portrayed the move to use emergency powers as unavoidable, saying it was not possible to negotiate with the protesters. “It wasn’t that they just wanted to be heard. They wanted to be obeyed,” Trudeau told the independent public commission looking into the Government’s use of the powers. I am absolutely, absolutely serene and confident that I made the right choice in agreeing with the invocation.” It was a rare appearance by a sitting Prime Minister at a public inquiry meant to shed light on the process that handed authorities extraordinary powers and determine whether decisions were made transparently with clear accountability. The final report is due to be presented in Canada’s Parliament by 20 February. Trudeau cited the threat of serious violence and local Police not having a credible plan to restore order as reasons that prompted him to invoke the Emergencies Act, which has not been used in its current form since it was created in the 1980s. Civil liberties advocates argued Police could have cleared the blockades using existing powers. Lawyers for the convoy organisers and others said Trudeau had not read a plan prepared by Ottawa Police and pointed to one border blockade being cleared and criminal charges laid at another without the use of emergency powers. Trudeau acknowledged that “not all tools had been used” by Police and said that was the problem. He said he would not have invoked emergency powers if anyone had convinced him the situation could have been resolved without them. “We kept hearing there was a plan…. (but it) was not even in the most generous of characterisations a plan,” Trudeau said. The act gave the Government temporary powers, including the ability to impose restrictions on public assembly and to mobilize federal support for local and provincial Police. It allowed financial institutions to temporarily freeze the bank accounts of people believed to be supporting the convoy and allowed the Government to order towing services to clear blockades. Earlier this week, Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada had faced “a dangerous moment” amid the protests, which shut down a vital trade corridor between the United States and Canada. Trudeau also said he had tried to reassure US President Joe Biden at the time that Canada was “going to continue to be a reliable partner” amid disruptions caused by border blockades. A lawyer for convoy organisers said the Emergencies Act could have been avoided had a “de-escalation agreement” with protesters been followed. She asked Trudeau: “When did you and your government start to become so afraid of your own citizens?” “I am not and we are not,” Trudeau replied. The impact of the protests reverberated in Canada and abroad long after the border blockades and Ottawa protests were cleared in February, with copycat protests featuring trailers and trucks following in the United States and France.

Also, it has been informed by the State Business Circular No. 04/2022 dated 8 August 2022 that expenses should not be incurred in connection with the festival activities,” he said. “In accordance with the President’s instructions, the President’s Secretary has issued instructions via Circular No. PS/5B/Circular/10/2022 dated 15 August 2022. Furthermore, the State Business Circular No. 04/2022 dated 8 August 2022 has advised that no expenses should be incurred in connection with the festival activities,” he said. Siriwardena stressed in addition, the Cabinet decision No. 22/VIV(032) dated 13 June 2022 regarding the seeking of Government funds by Government agencies for various events also allows Government agencies to organise events related to their scope as well as other events within the limited financial space."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/11/28/price-of-big-onions-to-drop/,Price of big onions to drop,Author not found,0,2022-11-27T20:49:00+00:00,"The Food Policy Committee has recommended reducing the Special Commodity Tax (SCL) rate. Accordingly, increasing the ability to buy big onions in the market will help to reduce the price of big onions. The Policy Committee met on 24 November. The national requirement for big onions is about 300,000 MT per annum which is mainly fulfilled by imports (86 per cent). Thus, the self-sufficiency ratio amounts to 14 per cent. The retail prices of imported big onions varied between Rs 290 – Rs 390 and the price of local big onions varied between Rs 340 – Rs 400 per kg as of the third week of November. The average CIF of imported big onions was Rs 95.3 per kg in the third week of November and it has only shown a relatively modest increase since mid-August 2022. The Government increased the applicable SCL on imported big onions from Rs 10 per kg to Rs 50 per kg from 22 September 2022 onwards. Subsequently, the imports of big onions started to fall drastically. Imports fell from 27,889 MT in August to only 13,496 MT in November (till week 3). This drop in availability pushed up the price of imported big onions from about Rs 175 per kilogramme in August to Rs 328 per kilogramme in week 3 of November. Nevertheless, a sharp drop in price is evident from 22 November to Rs 250 per kilogramme, however, prices still remain high compared to the period leading up to the SCL increase. It is important to note that the CIF of imported big onions has only increased slightly since August. Hence, the sudden hike in prices can be attributed to the increase in the SCL rate in September. From the month of August, the import of large onions will be reduced by 1,000 kg. The price (CIF value) has increased only marginally, and the reason for this sudden price increase may be the increase in the rate of Special Commodity Duty (SCL) in September."

The Committee also discussed the regulations under the Casino Business (Regulation) Act No. 17 of 2010, where the members of the Committee were of the opinion that it would be best to consider the approval after making it more effective for the development of the country. The committee also drew attention to the existing problems due to the absence of a casino regulatory authority. Dr. Harsha de Silva said no casino licence is granted without a casino regulatory body in any country. Thus, the officials said there is no provision to operate the casino apart from the tax paid to the Inland Revenue Department and as a preliminary step they have taken measures to issue these licences. There was a long discussion at the committee meeting regarding a number of issues related to the fact that there is no clear understanding of whether these casino businesses are paying the relevant taxes, how much tax has been collected by the Government or not, and there is no proper regulation regarding the existing casino businesses apart from the 4 registered casino businesses. Accordingly, the Committee on Public Finance decided to conduct a comparative study in this regard and reconsider the matter. (AK)"

He said this is what happens to a country when the only objective is to preserve one’s own power. He said such persons need to stop the business of making their own opinion victorious, or making decisions for the sake of the time, and using people to form an opinion in the country and added that living with them is too difficult. “It is the bounden duty of everyone to extend their solid support to the Government led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe if the burning economic crisis is to be resolved and the life of crisis-hit people is to be fixed. I took every action to modernise the school education system when I was the Education Minister during the Good Governance Government led by the United National Front (UNF),” Kariyawasam said. Speaking further, he said they had prepared a 13-year education and a vocational education system consisting of 27 subjects and set of standards to produce qualified persons for the local and international job market. “Vocational education was introduced to students who failed in the G.C.E. O/L and G.C.E. A/L. Various vocational training courses were introduced including hotel management, agriculture, and sports during the Good Governance regime and some of them are still functional, but poor attention is paid towards them,” Kariyawasam said. If the programmes recommended during the Good Governance regime were implemented, a large number of skilled workers would have been able to go overseas and bring more foreign exchange to Sri Lanka and they could have been transformed into stakeholders to resolve the prevailing economic crisis in the country, according to Kariyawasam.  “It is not like sending workers to the Middle East.

The announcement comes after Kim inspected a Nov. 18 test of the Hwasong-17, North Korea’s largest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and pledged to counter what he called U.S. nuclear threats. North Korea’s “ultimate goal is to possess the world’s most powerful strategic force, the absolute force unprecedented in the century,” Kim said in the order promoting the officers, adding that building up the country’s nuclear capabilities would reliably protect the dignity and sovereignty of the state and the people. He described the Hwasong-17 as the “world’s strongest strategic weapon” and said it demonstrated North Korea’s resolve and ability to eventually build the world’s strongest army. North Korean scientists have made a “wonderful leap forward in the development of the technology of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles,” and were expected to expand and strengthen the country’s nuclear deterrent capabilities at an extraordinarily rapid pace, Kim was also quoted as saying. Kim was pictured in photos posing with scientists, engineers and military officials involved in the test. According to state media, those workers pledged to defend the “absolute authority” of the party and Kim, and vowed that “our missiles will fly vigorously only in the direction indicated” by Kim. Capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, the launch of the Hwasong-17 prompted the United States to call for a United Nations Security Council presidential statement to hold North Korea accountable for its missile tests, which are banned by Security Council resolutions.

Sampanthan has emphasised that all Tamil political parties, who intend to participate in a series of discussions with the Government next month, aimed at resolving the ethnic issue, should grant their consent solely to a federal solution. Ceylon Today learns, the ITAK Leader had aired these views during a round of talks with the representatives of political parties in the TNA, at his official residence in Colombo, on 23 November. During this discussion, Sampanthan had stressed that the move made by the President to commence an urgent dialogue with the Tamil political parties towards the resolution of the vexed North-East issue should be welcomed by all political parties in the country.

Addressing the media, Nuttall said although attention had been paid to the situation, they are handicapped as there are certain limitations imposed by the Government on new recruitments. “This is because there is a high demand for the pilots at the moment from many airlines companies in the world. We held a board meeting regarding the matter as well as with the Ministry of Aviation,” he said. He said the company is willing to extend its operations if the capacity could be expanded. We have not been receiving any financial assistance from the Government since last March, he said. BY Bingun Menaka Gamage"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/11/25/president-talks-tough/,President talks tough,Author not found,0,2022-11-24T20:50:00+00:00,"President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasised that he will never allow violence and anarchy to prevail under the guise of human rights, adding that if any party engages in such an attempt, the security forces will be used to suppress it completely. Under such circumstances, the President emphasised that everyone from the soldier in the lowest rank of the Army to the rank of Field Marshal is obligated to fulfil their responsibility.   President Ranil Wickremesinghe said this delivering a special statement in Parliament yesterday (24). He accused certain factions of trying to constrain the Police under the guise of human rights. “Perhaps the Police have violated human rights. If some have done so, we are ready to take action against them if cases are filed and they are found guilty. Human rights cases are filed against the Police to stop them from taking action against those who create emergencies and riots. This is done not because of human rights, but to stop the Police from taking action against them. So, I asked the Attorney General to look into this. If they do that, the law should be implemented. This game cannot be allowed to continue forever.”  “When talking about the Army, some people said that the expenditure of the Army has increased. The allocations for the military cannot be reduced in 24 hours. The 25,000 employees cannot be put on the road at once. We are making a plan now. It should be done accordingly. The Army had to bear more expenses this time. We cannot stop it. Although the number of troops has decreased, promotions have increased. Such facts have also affected this. “The other thing is that now we have deployed the Army for food security programmes. Also, we get a lot of income from military farms and I have told them to use the Army as much as necessary for the transportation of those goods. We need to look at the future of the Army. We are working according to the Security 2030 report for that. We must plan our defences. “It is impossible to say that there is no threat in the world. These conditions are changing. Not the 1971 threat, the ‘80s, or the Easter Sunday incident. These threats happen in different ways. We must remember that. We must look at global conditions. We need to focus on the Indian Ocean. Our naval forces should be increased by 2030. The Army may decrease. “The Air Force may have more fighter jets. Drone technology is needed. By 2040, this situation will increase even more. We want to see how this will continue. We need to reduce our defence expenditure to maintain 3%-4%. “We have enough money to bring our economic growth rate to 8%. This situation was created in Singapore with this 8% economic growth for many years. We need to think anew. Also, those who leave the Army should have the opportunity to contribute to the work of this society. “Today, professionals are leaving this country. That gap can be filled by training our armed forces personnel and sending them to those places. That is why we have reduced the retirement age of military service from 22 to 18 years. Others have no problem. We have to plan these anew. We have to think anew. “I wish we could manufacture a new warship in Sri Lanka. We have that power. Only the money has to be found. We have also paid attention to the Police. We are getting a report called ‘Public Security Report’ to find out how to improve the Police in the next 10 years. I informed the Minister about it. Now the Police Ordinance has reached the stage where it has to be sent to the museum. We are now working on preparing a new Ordinance. There are many problems like drug trafficking and human trafficking today. We have to move forward in solving all these issues. I would like to remind the Minister of Education that not a single university student is in custody. Wasantha Mudalige was a university student for 8-9 years. This is very important. I left university at 21. Although Mudalige is 31 years old, he is still a university student. A student can only be given one extra year. After that, they should have to leave the university. I want to say something. I also want to protect human rights. Anarchy and violence cannot be allowed to encroach on human rights. Human rights cannot be used to create violence and anarchy. Those who cause violence in the name of human rights cannot be protected.”"

This was when the Fundamental Rights (FR) Petitions filed against the Presidential pardon granted to Silva, who was sentenced to death in 2016 over the murder of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra, was taken up before Supreme Court Justices Murdu Fernando and Yasantha Kodagoda. The two-Judge Bench approved the request made by the Petitioners to amend the caption of the Petition to include Rajapaksa in his personal capacity, as he is in no longer the President. Thereby, notice was ordered to be issued to Rajapaksa, to his private residence and to any other address in which he is accessible. Eraj de Silva with Daminda Wijayaratne and S Janagan instructed by Dimuthu Kuruppuarachchi, President’s Counsel M. A. Sumanthiran with Suren Fernando and Khyati Wickremanayake appeared on behalf the Petitioners. Previously, the Supreme Court issued an Interim Order suspending the operation of the Presidential pardon granted to Silva while an order impounding Silva’s passport was also made while the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was directed to implement the interim order. While Silva was sentenced to death in 2016 for the murder of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra in 2011, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa granted a special Presidential pardon to him in 2021.

The President claimed Gunaratnam has citizenship in Australia as well as in Sri Lanka. Jayagoda, addressing the media on the President’s allegations, claimed that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s statements in Parliament on Wednesday (23) and yesterday (24) were a declaration of war against all citizens. “Wickremesinghe perfectly knows comrade Gunaratnam is not a citizen of Australia. Gunaratnam had to leave the country given the circumstances in that era. When he returned to the country to engage in politics, the then Government arrested him. Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister of that Government. Now he is alleging that we are responsible for the violence on 9 May. This is completely false. If we had any connection to those incidents, he would not take it sitting down like this,” Jayagoda stressed. He said Ranil Wickremesinghe is breaking the law and the Constitution while saying he is protecting the Constitution. He said it is a joke that President is informing the people to obtain a permit to protest as the people are protesting against the Government. He said this war is between the people of the country and the clan which is filled with fraudsters, murderers, robber and the power hungry. The innocent people fought against the corrupt parties. The ‘Aragalaya’ was a fantastic uprising of the people, he said. While noting that the fight must be completed, as an incomplete fight is a failure, Jayagoda emphasised the FSP will protect the Aragalaya from all forces. He claimed the President is scared and that is why he is roaming around making arbitrary statements. Jayagoda requested the people to not be scared of these claims and to be strong.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

They noted that if they are removed from the Party and are formally informed, they will take legal action. They also stressed that they would never leave the Party even if they were removed from portfolios or membership. MPs Shantha Bandara, Chamara Sampath, Duminda Dissanayake, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Mahinda Amaraweera, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Jagath Pushpakumara, and Suren Raghawan were among the ministers who addressed the media briefing to express their concerns. De Silva also said they were working for the betterment of the country and that they could not be selfish or jealous in order to assist the country in overcoming this crisis. He said they will never join other parties and will always support the SLFP. He claimed that history has shown that there are members who have betrayed the SLFP. Addressing the media, Dissanayake said if mistakes were made in the past, he was also a part of them, but now, more than the party’s decision, they should consider the public. He noted that they have been SLFP members for generations and that no one can remove their membership based on a letter. He noted that their home is the SLFP, and that despite many attempts to persuade them to join other parties, they do not want to be a part of any other space. He also stressed that in order to address the issues that have arisen within the party, the leadership should be handed over to someone else, with SLFP Chairman Maithripala Sirisena acting as a patron. After they were kicked out of the UNP, no one went to the party’s headquarters in Sirikotha, according to Sampath. BY Savani Sheashadhi"

The high-risk groups (HRG) include pregnant women, children below two years, elderly persons, and those with chronic diseases.

In addition to that, he also receives a pension for his previous 29 years of service at the Central Bank. Dr. Weerasinghe was responding to a question posed to him at the Central Bank’s press conference yesterday. “I want to categorically state that I am not entitled to any retirement benefits as a consequence of my earlier two year secondment to the International Monetary Fund as the Alternate Executive Director to the IMF’s headquarters in Washington,” the Governor said. “Some politicians have implied that I am entitled to IMF retirement benefits, but that is not true.” He stated that Ajith Nivard Cabraal was appointed Central Bank Governor for the second time and elevated the post to a Cabinet rank, and that his salary was increased to Rs 400,000 per month. He claimed that Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the previous Governor, was paid only Rs 150,000. Dr. Weerasinghe also said that during Cabraal’s second term as governor, the Central Bank used tax money to pay for a private staff service. As a result, from October 2021 to April 2022, Cabraal had a separate private secretary, a private press secretary, and benefited from the ministerial security. Dr. Weerasinghe thinks that a person who works for the government should have to work for at least 10 years before getting a pension. He said that even though people who have been governor for a few months are eligible for retirement benefits, he does not plan to take a pension for his current job as Governor of the Central Bank. Reports say that former governors of the Central Bank, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy and Sunil Mendis, turned down their pensions. Professor W.D. Lakshman was governor for only a few months. He is now retired and enjoying the retirement benefits of that job. By Ishara Gamage"

SLBFE confirmed that the Cabinet has approved the repatriation of 77 women stranded in Oman and another 77 stranded in Dubai, as a result of human trafficking linked to overstaying on visit and tourist visas. Deputy General Manager of the SLBFE, Senarath Yapa, said there are SLBFE registered workers and undocumented (not with the SLBFE) workers  among those who had travelled to the those two countries.  He said out of the 77 in Oman, 12 were registered with the SLBFE, however, the entire group will be brought back to Sri Lanka and it has been approved. He added that while 77 were to be repatriated from Oman another four stranded so called domestic workers in Oman have surrendered to the welfare camp run by the Sri Lankan Mission. He added at that beginning of the month of November 2022, the issue of single visit visa and tourist visa for domestic workers were completely stopped and on 11 of November, the SLBFE stopped all employment agencies from issuing visit or tourist visa for domestic workers. It has been the tradition that the Middle Eastern countries accept visit and tourist visa and allow it to be transferred to employment visa, but this is now being highly exploited with some racketeers getting the visit visa and then not finding jobs for those arrive on visit visa and later engage them to cross the borders and enter into prostitution for survival. According to reliable sources, Sri Lankan women are forced into sexual slavery for amounts as much as Rs 2.5 million. Yapa said already three local officials have been arrested in connection with this exploitation racket and one of the SLBFE employees in Oman will be brought back for engaging in these nefarious activities.

The plaintiff has alleged that during his tenure as the Central Bank Governor, from 2006 to 2015, Cabraal had paid a sum of USD 6.5 million to a Pakistani-American political donor Imaad Zuberi with obtaining approval from the Cabinet of Ministers and is thereby responsible for criminal breach of trust and criminal abuse of funds.

Wickremasinghe, Deputy Director General of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL), Colombo has sent the following clarification: “The above-mentioned article published in the Ceylon Today newspaper on 31 October 2022 contained inaccurate information regarding the concerned matter of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, which is the apex tertiary care hospital delivering patient care services to patients referred from many regions of the island. Therefore, I would like to provide you the accurate information about the relevant matter. I kindly hope that your office will arrange the necessary to publish the correct information described in this letter in your newspaper. The information “X-rays cannot be performed on patients arriving at the Hospital” is incorrect. The Accident and Emergency Unit is equipped to perform all necessary X-rays and is currently providing services as usual. In fact all necessary X-rays were carried out then and there. The X-Ray tests performed in the accident and emergency unit are forwarded to the relevant clinical departments through a computer system (PACS- Picture Archiving and Communication System) using digital technology. The X-Ray records are stored and examined with the help of this computer system without the use of paper (paperless) or the use of printed images (filmless). This computer system needs regular maintenance and upgrading. Therefore, during such maintenance work on the computer system, it had to be turned off for a short period. During this period necessary arrangements are made to prevent disruption of patient care services. The necessary facilities are provided to the medical officers to examine the X-Rays through other alternative methods. Since the accident and emergency unit operates 24 hours a day, essential maintenance and updates of the system are usually performed this way. We would like to mention that the required X- Ray tests for the patients arriving at the accident and emergency unit can be performed without any interruption. The CT machine installed at the accident and emergency unit is about 12 years old and is currently not functioning. This is because the manufacturer has discontinued production of the spare parts required to repair this machine. Therefore, the local agent and the Biomedical Engineering Unit of the Ministry of Health have reported that this CT machine cannot be repaired and commissioned again. Furthermore, the operating lifetime of this CT machine has been exceeded and during its lifetime the machine has been utilized to the maximum extent. The Ministry of Health has been requested to provide a new CT machine for the accident and emergency unit and we have come to know that the necessary work is underway to procure a new one. We would like to mention that arrangements are made to carry out required CT tests for patients attending the Accident and Emergency Unit using other CT machines in the hospital. I hope that the above information is adequate to convey accurate facts to the public. Furthermore, I would like to mention that we are ready to provide the correct information that can be provided upon your request regarding matters related to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Your support is highly appreciated."

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

A private plaint, filed by former Governor of the Southern Province, Ranjith Keerthi Tennakoon via an affidavit, was called before Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court last morning . The plaintiff has alleged that during his tenure as the Central Bank Governor, from 2006 to 2015, Cabraal had paid a sum of USD 6.5 million to a Pakistani-American political donor Imaad Zuberi with obtaining approval from the Cabinet of Ministers and is thereby responsible for criminal breach of trust and criminal abuse of funds. Tennakoon has also charged Cabraal with causing a loss of USD 500 million to the Government via sovereign bonds due on 18 January 2022, while serving as the Central Bank Governor. According to the plaintiff, the Sri Lankan Government incurred a loss of Rs 10.04 billion through the appointing of close relatives to positions and from the release of confidential information on Treasury bills and bond issues, during his tenure as the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. When the case was taken up before Additional Magistrate Kekunawala, the lawyers representing Cabraal raised preliminary objections against proceeding with the matter. Accordingly, the lawyers, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, were ordered to present written submissions at the next hearing pertaining to the preliminary objections raised by the defence. Tennakoon, via his private plaint, has charged that the actions of the former CBSL Governor had flouted Provisions contained in Sections 388, 392 and 386 of the Penal Code as well as Provisions contained in Section 56 (1) of the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance No. 7 of 1937.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/11/25/nhsl-dy-director-clarifies/,NHSL Dy Director clarifies,Author not found,0,2022-11-24T20:30:00+00:00,"With reference to the article, ‘X-rays, CT scans halted at National Hospital due to machine malfunctions’, published in Ceylon Today on 31 October 2022, Dr. W.K. Wickremasinghe, Deputy Director General of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL), Colombo has sent the following clarification: “The above-mentioned article published in the Ceylon Today newspaper on 31 October 2022 contained inaccurate information regarding the concerned matter of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, which is the apex tertiary care hospital delivering patient care services to patients referred from many regions of the island. Therefore, I would like to provide you the accurate information about the relevant matter. I kindly hope that your office will arrange the necessary to publish the correct information described in this letter in your newspaper. The information “X-rays cannot be performed on patients arriving at the Hospital” is incorrect. The Accident and Emergency Unit is equipped to perform all necessary X-rays and is currently providing services as usual. In fact all necessary X-rays were carried out then and there. The X-Ray tests performed in the accident and emergency unit are forwarded to the relevant clinical departments through a computer system (PACS- Picture Archiving and Communication System) using digital technology. The X-Ray records are stored and examined with the help of this computer system without the use of paper (paperless) or the use of printed images (filmless). This computer system needs regular maintenance and upgrading. Therefore, during such maintenance work on the computer system, it had to be turned off for a short period. During this period necessary arrangements are made to prevent disruption of patient care services. The necessary facilities are provided to the medical officers to examine the X-Rays through other alternative methods. Since the accident and emergency unit operates 24 hours a day, essential maintenance and updates of the system are usually performed this way. We would like to mention that the required X- Ray tests for the patients arriving at the accident and emergency unit can be performed without any interruption. The CT machine installed at the accident and emergency unit is about 12 years old and is currently not functioning. This is because the manufacturer has discontinued production of the spare parts required to repair this machine. Therefore, the local agent and the Biomedical Engineering Unit of the Ministry of Health have reported that this CT machine cannot be repaired and commissioned again. Furthermore, the operating lifetime of this CT machine has been exceeded and during its lifetime the machine has been utilized to the maximum extent. The Ministry of Health has been requested to provide a new CT machine for the accident and emergency unit and we have come to know that the necessary work is underway to procure a new one. We would like to mention that arrangements are made to carry out required CT tests for patients attending the Accident and Emergency Unit using other CT machines in the hospital. I hope that the above information is adequate to convey accurate facts to the public. Furthermore, I would like to mention that we are ready to provide the correct information that can be provided upon your request regarding matters related to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Your support is highly appreciated."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/11/25/ali-sabry-reaffirms-sls-commitment-to-maritime-sustainability/,Ali Sabry reaffirms SL’s commitment to maritime sustainability,Author not found,0,2022-11-24T20:30:00+00:00,"Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, addressing the Council of Ministers’ meeting of Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) in Bangladesh yesterday (24), apprised member states with regard to Sri Lanka’s efforts in sustainable and efficacious usage of maritime resources and immense ocean pollution challenges as well as projects and programmes implemented to safeguard the coastal belt and the Indian Ocean and that Sri Lanka remains committed to a safe, secure Indian Ocean and sustainable use of its maritime resources. He underlined maintaining a pollution-free and cleaner Indian Ocean following the MV X-Press Pearl calamity last year and emphasised the necessity for countries to work in a concerted manner in addressing ocean pollution, especially during maritime disasters. “Our efforts in addressing massive ocean pollution challenges stem as a result of accidents such as the X-Press Pearl Disaster, which unfortunately, disrupted the region on an unprecedented scale. The X-Press Pearl incident is the worst maritime disaster that Sri Lanka has confronted in modern times. The vessel was carrying a total of nearly 1,500 containers that included cargo with hazardous substances, in addition to about 325 metric tonnes of fuel on board.” He added that the disaster is now considered as the largest ship disaster involving plastic pellets, hazardous and noxious materials, in the world. The geographic implications of the incident remain unknown given its developing nature. A substantial proportion of the plastic pellet pollution will remain mobilised in the ocean for decades to come. Modelling studies suggest that the pellets will make landfall across Indian Ocean coastlines. We have implemented a significant number of projects and programmes to ensure that our ocean remains less polluted and cleaner following this incident and we have been working with many other countries and international agencies, which deal and address ocean pollution to lessen the negative impact of this disaster. The Minister underscored the significance and necessity of actively engaging with the countries of IORA and that the IORA is to mutually advance economic and commercial interests of Sri Lanka as well as to maintain peace and stability in the Indian Ocean. He further stressed that Sri Lanka’s commitment to the matters that concern the Indian Ocean region remain as one of the key cornerstones of the economic and foreign policy of Sri Lanka. Recalling the historical background on trade and commerce as well as connectivity in the Indian Ocean region, the Minister highlighted that Sri Lanka is strategically positioned at the centre of one of the busiest sea lanes in the world. He also added that Sri Lanka’s traditional and ancient links with the countries of the Indian Ocean Rim Association go back many centuries and empirical evidence reveals that Sri Lanka’s geographical centrality markedly facilitated and aided maritime commerce and trade over the centuries. The Minister said, Sri Lanka has demonstrated manifestly significant openness to trade and commerce and, today, Sri Lanka is well positioned to be one of the major trading hubs of the Indian Ocean. Given the progression as an Indian Ocean hub, Sri Lanka has emerged as one of the most pivotal shipping lanes, as two-thirds of the petroleum products and half of the container shipments of the world criss-cross close to the Southern Coast of the island. Highlighting Sri Lanka’s interests in the IORA and the region, as well as Sri Lanka’s active role in the organisation as the current Vice Chair of IORA, the Minister said Sri Lanka will be the next Chair of the IORA from 2023 to 2025 with a firm conviction to further expand and elevate the scope and breadth of the organisation to be more relevant and more pertinent to the rapidly emerging importance of the Indian Ocean in the present geopolitical and geoeconomic scenario."

The University of Colombo Alumni Partnership Programme is a continuing initiative of the Alumni Association of the University of Colombo, which represents all Alumni of the University of Colombo, to work closely with leading private and public sector organisations to provide opportunities for enhanced corporate sector involvement and support in the UoC’s activities. Formed in 1982, the Alumni Association of the University of Colombo is an apex body of the alumni of various faculties of the University, forming a link between its membership and the University. Members of the Association comprise all Alumni who have passed out of the University of Colombo. Today, the Association continues its role of fostering close ties between the student body, University and its alumni. The Alumni Association of the University of Colombo views its role as ‘connectors’ and thought leaders very seriously and to this end, not only conducts various programs and initiatives targeting the development and welfare of undergraduates and its members but also conducts public forums to create awareness and discussion in matters of public importance. Pradeep Uluwaduge, Chief Human Resource Officer of the LOLC Group said “As the largest conglomerate in Sri Lanka, we always treasure our strong rapport with the premier University in the country, the University of Colombo. In spite of the present economic and social stress, a close link between higher educational institutions and the industry is of paramount importance. I firmly believe our Corporate partnership with the UoC Alumni can play a pivotal role in new dimensions to bridge gaps in our traditional education system.” Rajeev Amarasuriya, UoC Alumni President said, “it was comforting to note that the Corporate Sector has not shelved their Corporate Social Responsibilities during these trying times for everyone. The LOLC Group has supported the activities of the Association now for several years, and we appreciate the support we receive, not only financially but technically as well.” Amarasuriya went on to state that the next significant activity of the Association was holding the 17th Annual Sujata Jayawardena Memorial Oration on the topic ‘Economic Crisis: Where are we, and where do we go from here?’ which will be delivered by Former Central Bank Governor Deshamanaya Indrajit Coomaraswamy on 29th November at the BMICH."

There will be no more ‘Aragalaya’ to topple the Government. I will deploy the military and declare a State of Emergency to handle such attempts. There is no place for ‘Dinh Diems’ in this country,” the President stressed. Wickremesinghe, participating in the Committee Stage Debate on Budget 2023 said he will not dissolve the House until stability returns to the country. The President also said he will appoint a Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) to probe the “forces” who created unrest in the country and which media institutions incited people to burn down houses. “We have gone to Court in regard to the violence on 9 May. One MP was killed on the street. Another MP who first said ‘Gota Go Home’ was brutally assaulted. Houses of MPs were burnt down. Some of them did not even go to Temple Trees on that day. This violence is unacceptable. On 9 July, the former President was chased away. After that, so-called ‘Aragalayites’ captured the President’s House and Presidential Secretariat. Look at the damage they have done to those buildings. I have a full report of damage caused to those buildings,” he said. Speaking further, Wickremesinghe accused Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Leader Kumar Gunaratnam of being behind the attempt to capture Parliament on 13 July, and trying to create chaos and violence islandwide “After that, they demanded that I resign. Why should I resign? Majority of Parliament was there. If an All-Party Government was set up then I could have resigned. When I said I will not resign from the post, my house was set alight. Then, on 13 July, there was an attempt to capture Parliament. They were to capture the Supreme Court next. They captured the Prime Minister’s Office. That was how they tried to set up a puppet government,” he alleged. How can the FSP leader, who is a dual citizen of Sri Lanka and Australia, say that Basil Rajapaksa should be barred from Parliament? he queried. He requested the Opposition not to be deceived by “vicious forces” that try to unleash chaos in the country. “Those who unleashed violence are not the common people. In the end, they accused me of being a dictator. They told foreign media that there is not dictator in the world like me. I was the one who brought 17th, 19th and 21st Amendments to the Constitution and now I have become a dictator like Hitler. Even Al Jazeera said Ranil is a dictator and asked me to be a democratic leader like the Qatari Emir. I cannot be like that,” he said. The President said he is not against legal protests. “I request the people to engage in protests, marches, and meetings in a legal manner. It is okay to scream that I am a dictator, I do not mind. But if you are trying to engage in such things without a licence and blocking the roads, that would not be permitted,” he asserted. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena: “MP Chamara Sampath, now your turn to speak.” Dassanayake: “I am not an MP, but a ‘Minister’ now thanks to the President. President Ranil Wickremesinghe gave me a ministerial portfolio. Don’t you know that? So, don’t call me an MP. You should work according to the traditions of Parliament.” The Speaker, who was laughing at Dassanayake’s sudden outburst said, “Okay, okay. I am sorry ‘Minister.’ It is your turn to speak now!” Meanwhile, State Minister Dassanayake said he would resign from his portfolio, if he fails to collect USD 500 million from the gem industry next year. He stressed that although gems worth over USD 1 billion have been exported, payments for the exported gems have not been received yet. Dassanayake was responding to Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa when the latter raised concerns on the gem industry. Premadasa said, gem businessmen as well as those engaged in the mining industry face severe difficulties due to the absence of an online system for gem exports. “The gem industry is a sector that makes a very special contribution to the economy of this country. In the last year (2021), an income of USD 276 million was earned through the exportation of gems, diamonds and jewellery in Sri Lanka. However, more money can be earned through this industry,” Premadasa said. In response, Dassanayake said he will never allow the industry to collapse and that he effort to earn USD 500 million from the industry within next year (2023). He added that income received from the gem industry is only USD 170 million for 2022 and he would resign from his ministerial post if he fails to earn the promised amount of USD 500 million.

This was discussed at the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms under the chairmanship of Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and President’s Counsel Sarath Jayamanne. The Minister said, all allegations of bribery and corruption in the country are being levelled at parliamentarians due to the failure to create a formal institutional structure and provide the necessary powers to prevent bribery, corruption, and fraud. President’s Counsel Sarath Jayamanne said, the proposed Bribery or Corruption Investigation Commission will be accountable to Parliament and that the Commission will submit its progress report to Parliament every three months. The Bill also proposes to appoint persons with over 20 years of experience in the fields of law, forensic audit, accounting, engineering, international relations and diplomatic service, and public administration as commissioners of the commission, he said. Commissioners are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council and also the allocation of money for this commission should be done directly through Parliament, Sarath Jayamanne added. In addition, the draft has proposed to establish a separate board of directors to receive asset liability statements and deal with related issues. According to the Bill, it was stated that the relevant minister has the ability to make regulations regarding obtaining asset and liability statements of individuals in areas where corruption and bribery occur more, excluding executive officers of the public sector, Jayamanne said. He said, as important government departments are connected with this office through the Internet, inquiries about assets and liabilities can be made easily. It was discussed that it includes provisions to prevent bribery and corruption in the private sector, sports sector, and is not only limited to the public sector. The Committee also emphasised the need to give severe punishment to those found guilty in the investigation of bribery scams. The minister said he is expected to discuss the proposed Bill in a more democratic manner and make amendments. He also briefed the committee on “The Recovery of Possession of the Premises given on Lease (Special Provisions) Bill” to be passed in Parliament. He pointed out that the main objective of this enactment is to reduce the laws delay in any ordinary rent and ejectment action in regular procedure and to grant relief to the lessor in a very short period. This Bill introduces a swift and efficient process and an ejectment of overholding lessees who are in occupation of premises in relation to duly executed notarial lease agreements. Further, the Order published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2301/33 dated 12 October 2022 enacted by the Minister of Justice under the Mutual Cooperation in Criminal Matters Act No. 25 of 2022 was also approved.

Speaking to the media at the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB), Consultant Community Physician (CCP), Dr. Janaka Weragoda said yesterday (23) that this year to date a total of 429 new HIV positive cases had been detected in the community while last year there had been 411 cases. “There has been a slight increase in numbers,” he said, adding… …that to-date only about 83 per cent of HIV cases had been detected from society.  In view of World AIDS Day, which will be marked on 1 December 2022, Dr. Weragoda said, from the cases that had been detected, there had been an increase in the number of men testing positive for HIV. When last year there had been five men testing positive for the virus, only one woman had tested positive for the virus. But by November 2022, the number had spiked to 1:7, which showed that when seven men tested positive for HIV, only one woman was HIV positive. “Testing should be increased, so as to ensure that patients are detected at an early stage. There should also be prevention and control programmes to control the disease,” he said. Consultant Venereologist, National STD/AIDS Control Programme, Dr. Nimali Jayasuriya said, UNAIDS had released a new set of targets. It aimed “for 95 per cent of people living with HIV to know their HIV situation, for 95 per cent of all people diagnosed with HIV infection to receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and for 95 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy to have viral suppression by 2030.” She said, the virus could be controlled if patients were detected early. In Sri Lanka, 90 per cent of the time HIV is contracted due to unprotected sex. The high risk groups include men who have sex with men, transgender women, commercial sex workers, drug addicts, beach boys, and prisoners. Dr. Jayasuriya said, in addition to the early clinical method of testing, other testing methods such as the testing conducted on risk-prone persons in the field with the Rapid Test and the Self-test were also available.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

In regard to the office of the Attorney General, the MP said the AG who appears on behalf of the Government, defends the Government even when the Right to Information Commission orders the Central Bank to divulge certain information. “Now these are public funds, these are monies of the people of this country.” The MP says there is absolutely no transparency; evidently, large-scale corruption and fraud and all that is covered up by the Government, by the Central Bank, by the EPF Department, and by the Attorney General. He pointed out that the Government pays lip service, but every action of the Government demonstrates the opposite and said Anura Kumara Dissanayake cited the case of a Minister who asked an Ambassador for a bribe, which was reported. Following that, he was suspended from Cabinet, and he got a committee of his choice appointed which exonerated him, but now he is back in Cabinet. To add insult to injury, that very Minister has been appointed as the President’s nominee on the Constitutional Council, a Constitutional Council which is supposed to appoint independent commissions – handpicked, handpicked because there is no one who is up to that mark, in Cabinet. “Now who has the brass to go and ask an Ambassador for a bribe? I suppose the other ministers are a little less corrupt. So you have to pick the most corrupt, to appoint to the Constitutional Council. You have a convicted extortionist as a Chief Government Whip. A convicted extortionist, so how do we then tell either the IMF or anyone else that we are dealing with corruption? The Government has really no intention of doing any of that sort, the President has no intention.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

It could be various gangs, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), or foreign aid; receiving funds from them is strictly prohibited,” he said. Dr. Rajapakshe said regardless of victory or defeat, the candidate must provide an affidavit of account summaries of election funds three weeks after the election. He stressed that if false facts were mentioned in the affidavit, he has the authority to consider it an offence and impose a relevant punishment. “In addition, under this Act, the Magistrate’s Court has the authority to prosecute and punish for giving false affidavits under the Penal Code,” he added.

The initiative is a volunteer-run, public-private partnership under the aegis of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, and allows hospitals and treatment centres from across Sri Lanka to register their requirements for lifesaving medicines and medical supplies that may be in short supply, due to the country’s ongoing economic and foreign exchange crises. ‘Elixir’ also provides a single streamlined interface for donors who would like to support Sri Lanka at this time. By having all requirements and donations coming in via a unified and seamless platform, ‘Elixir’ can then match requirements and donations for efficient use of funds and time, while also reducing the total turnaround time for assistance and increasing transparency. Additionally, by having a large number of institutions registering their requirements, this allows the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society and its network of global volunteers to consider bulk order placement where possible to obtain the best possible prices, delivering maximum cost efficiency to all stakeholders. Designed and operated by the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, together with its global network of volunteers and professionals, and in partnership with the Sri Lanka Medical Supplies Division of the Ministry of Health, the Elixir Platform is a huge collaborative undertaking to help Sri Lanka overcome the shortage of lifesaving medicines due to the present economic crisis. Discussing the initiative, Dr. Mahesh Gunasekara, Director General of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society said, “First, we must express our sincere gratitude to all the donors, including individuals, charities, corporations and governments, who have come to Sri Lanka’s aid at this time of need. With the large amount of donations, we found that it was becoming challenging to track and fulfil medical needs across the system and prioritise based on urgency. Other challenges including oversupply due to duplicative efforts, high costs due to not utilising economies of scale, internal competition for donations and other issues have arisen, along with a lack of transparency. Thus, ‘Elixir’ is our answer to these problems, and will facilitate transparency and accountability throughout the entire supply chain for the benefit of all stakeholders. In fact, the Elixir platform will be audited on a monthly basis by KPMG. On behalf of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, I take this opportunity to thank all volunteers and partners in this endeavour. Elixir is truly a landmark achievement and we look forward to supporting Sri Lanka as it overcomes its present challenges.”"

Dr. Perera, when contacted yesterday (22), said although the number of patients with Covid-19 has reduced, an increase is observed in the number of patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The main cause of the infection could be a virus, but all young patients cannot be given antibiotics, although some parents ask for antibiotics for their children. Identifying the symptoms, he said young patients who sought treatment had fever, runny nose or a blocked nose, cough, poor appetite, vomiting, and at times diarrhoea. In most cases, treatment was given for symptoms that children developed, he said. Dr. Perera explained that Paracetamol was prescribed for fever while parents should only use lukewarm water to sponge the sick child and refrain from using iced or tap water to do so.     The Consultant Paediatrician urged parents to refrain from sending their children to school or to day care centres should they develop upper respiratory tract infections. Further, he said it was best that children and even adults with such infections wear a mask as well as maintain hand hygiene by washing hands with soap. Also, when sneezing, it is always best to use the elbow to cover one’s nose and mouth. Those who contract lower respiratory tract infections may suffer from wheezing and even pneumonia if timely treatment is not sought. They may also develop complications with secondary bacterial infections which could worsen the condition of children below two years, pregnant women, the elderly, and those who are immunocompromised.

Exchange of offenders between SL and Mauritius Cabinet approved the resolution submitted by the Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to enter into the agreement between Sri Lanka and the Republic of Mauritius to exchange offenders between the two countries. In terms of the provisions of the Transfer of Offenders Act No. 5 of 1995, there is the opportunity for any foreigner proven guilty by a court of law in Sri Lanka and is prisoned to be under the imprisonment for him/her by being in his/her country where he/she is a citizen. Furthermore, the Act contains provisions for sending any Sri Lankan who has been under imprisonment in another country to Sri Lanka and be under the same imprisonment within Sri Lanka until the penalty is fully covered. In order to act in such a way, there should be an agreement entered into between Sri Lanka and the other country. Committee on Petroleum Products Section 5 (1) of the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Act No. 33 of 2002 comprises provisions that licences can be issued by the subject minister for import, export, sale, supply and distribution of petroleum to any individual or a company on the recommendations of the ‘Energy Supply Committee’ appointed as per the provisions of Section 2 of Energy Supply (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 2 of 2002. However, due to imposition of the Energy Supply (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 2 of 2002 for two years, the Energy Supply Committee appointed under the provisions of that Act has been abolished. In terms of the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 27 of 2022, provisions have been furnished to appoint a “Committee Appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers” instead of the “Energy Supply Committee.” Therefore, Cabinet approved the proposal furnished by the Minister of Electricity and Power to appoint the said Committee. Revision of National Archives Law No. 48 of 1973 According to Cabinet decision on 5 December 2012, the Legal Draftsman has been directed to prepare the Bill to amend the National Archives Law No. 48 of 1973. The Legal Draftsman has informed that the policy approval of the present Cabinet should be obtained for the Bill prepared accordingly. In addition to paper documents, audio-visual documents, film documents, and digital documents are widely available for preservation. Therefore, the need to further amend the Act to meet international standards and national needs has been identified. Cabinet approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs to appoint a committee consisting of experts in document management, document preservation and digital document management to identify appropriate amendments and to take necessary steps to further amend the Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman by including appropriate provisions. Import and Export Regulations Cabinet approved the proposal presented by the President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to submit the Import Control Regulation for Payment Terms No. 19 of 2022 and Import and Export (Control) Regulations No. 20 of 2022 issued under the Import and Export (Control) Act No. 1 of 1969 to Parliament for approval. Proposed Banking (Special Provisions) Act The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has identified that strengthening the Bank Resolution Framework, under the Crisis Management Framework of Financial Institutions Regulated by the CBSL, as an urgent and priority task. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have also pointed out the importance of strengthening the resolution framework to strengthen financial sector safety nets. It is difficult to enact a new complete banking law in a short period. Therefore, the proposed Banking (Special Provisions) Act will be drawn up as a supplement to the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, introducing provisions for resolution of licensed banks, deposit insurance and winding up/liquidation of licensed banks. The CBSL has prepared an initial Bill and Cabinet approved the proposal presented by the President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to advise the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill based on the initial Bill above."

However, he said large-scale raids are now taking place in order to arrest the perpetrators and eradicate the use of drugs, which is destroying society.

He said, World Fisheries Day is important to Sri Lanka for many reasons. The sea is an invaluable resource for people of an island nation.

This is in order to provide the necessary guidance required for the conservation of the environmentally-sensitive areas, as well as sustainable utilisation by ensuring management access at all levels along with obtaining the participation of all sectors such as the community, private sector, State sector and experts for planning land utilisation and management in those areas identifying the environmentally-sensitive areas islandwide. The Cabinet Paper was submitted by the Minister of Environment. Numerous issues have emerged such as degradation of ecosystems, soil erosion, drying of hydro-catchment areas/ water sources as well as human-wildlife conflicts due to various human activities such as informal land use, agricultural habits as well as the irregular disposal of waste and non-sustainable utilisation of national resources. As a result of this, the foundation of the biodiversity and ecosystems has been threatened. This may lead to a vicious circle of ecosystems degradation in the long run. Therefore, the purpose and the expectation of the establishment of National Policy on Environmentally-Sensitive Areas is to ensure a healthy, secure and conserved environment and an economy through establishment of environmentally-sensitive areas aimed at an environment where socio-economic well-being and liveability of everyone is ensured.

Rasamanickam said, he has brought this to the attention of officials, as the livelihood of farmers was at stake. He was speaking during an inspection tour of the area on Sunday (20). “Illegal sand mining is taking place in the areas which come under the purview of The Department of Forest Conservation. It has created suspicion among residents. Who is behind this sand mafia? There are two Ministers from the Batticaloa District and one is in charge of environmental affairs,” Rasamanickam said. “A large stretch of land used for cultivation has been taken over by The Department of Forest Conservation, claiming to be Government land, but natural resources are being exploited and illegal sand mining is taking place,” Rasamanickam added.  Rasamanickam said, ordinary citizens were arrested and fined Rs 20,000 for entering the forest. The illegally mined sand is stored on land belonging to The Department of Forest Conservation, Rasamanickam said. Rasamanickam queried whether The Department of Forest Conservation is behind this sand mafia, alleging that this may be why regional and district development committee meetings aren’t held. “Two Ministers representing the Batticaloa District must be responsible for illegal sand mining.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The incident occurred while the agency’s owner was in Dubai. Sharmila wrote in the complaint that she has been working for a salary of Rs 30,000 as an accountant for three months at the foreign recruitment agency at Maligakanda that also serves as a travel and tours agency. According to her, the agency where she worked had sent a woman to Dubai on a tourist visa for domestic work and she has been ill with blood cancer and had wanted to return to Sri Lanka.   The ailing woman’s family had paid Rs 150,000 on 22 September to the agency but the agency did not repatriate the girl, hence the family had gone to the SLBFE against the agency owner. The domestic worker had left on 6 August 2022 but she was diagnosed with blood cancer and wanted to return. The accountant alleged that the agency had asked for Rs 800,000 from the family to repatriate her from Dubai. On 2 November 2022 the officials from the SLBFE bureau had visited the agency over the matter and warned the staff in absence of the agency owner. The accountant had informed the owner of the agency and his sister about the visit of the SLBFE officials but they had told the accountant that they have “taken care of the issue and not to worry and continue to work. They had reassured her that everything has been done by a bureau officer and told her to work without fear. However on 14 November around five officers from the SLBFE, including a woman officer, had walked forcefully into the agency and removed some documents and forced the woman accountant to go with them. She said one of the officers had threatened her saying that he will smash her face and to shut up when she asked why are they taking her to the Police. The accountant was locked up in a room at the SLBFE from 3 pm until 8 pm   and handed over to the Thalangama Police where she was remanded until next day morning.  On the morning of 15 November the SLBFE officials took her to their office and made her stay until 3 pm and then produced her at the Maligakanda Police (her case number is B 33226). The owner of the agency, Mohamed Ifthikar and his sister Ifthikar Pathima have been questioning the accountant as to what she had told the SLBFE and the Police and never came to forward to represent her over the incident, she told Ceylon Today.  Instead of giving any information on how to resolve the issue they had verbally abused her over the phone. Following the ordeal, the accountant from Batticaloa, on 16 November complained to the HRCSL to take action against the SLBFE and the owner of the agency over unlawful arrest. It is dubious how the SLBFE was informed over the sick woman, who went on a visit visa to Dubai. It is alleged that the SLBFE at the Bandaranaike International Airport charged the SLBFE fee from workers whether they go on job visa or visit visa. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The CID told the Court that their probe had revealed that the suspect had sent six female migrant workers to Oman to be used as sex workers. They informed Magistrate Perera that further investigations are currently being conducted to ascertain details with regard to places used as residences by the suspect as well as to ascertain her identity. Hence, the CID urged the Court to issue an order for the incarceration of the suspect. A group of Lawyers, headed by Niroshan Siriwardena appeared on behalf of the suspect. He told the Court that his client had been employed at a firm in Oman, as its translator for a period of 21 years and stressed that while she had gone to work in 2019, she had fallen sick prompting her to return home the following year. The Counsel added that it had come to their attention that when his client had been planning to leave for Oman, the Court had ordered to impound her passport. Attorney Siriwardene mentioned that the suspect is only the translator of her firm and observed that his client had not committed any offence. He then remarked that the suspect, via her lawyers, had surrendered to the CID through her own volition and that afterwards she had been arrested by the CID and produced in Court. The lawyers requested the Court to enlarge their client on bail. The Court then released the suspect on bail and fixed further hearing of the case to 1 December. By Hansi Nanayakkara"

Amaraweera thereby instructed to blacklist the said company for their failure to follow protocols and to not make ant payment to that company. ‘’The organic fertiliser required for paddy cultivation is now supplied by manufacturers through Farmers’ Service Centres with no Government intervention and the Secretariat will test three organic fertiliser samples of each product and if it is found that such fertiliser is of inferior quality, the company will be blacklisted and the government has decided not to pay the related amount regardless of how much they have sold,’’ he said. ‘’All necessary measures will be taken to ensure that there is no substandard fertiliser in the market as this could affect the quality of the harvest,’’ Amaraweera said adding that further investigations will be conducted to track down such acts and such companies will be similarly blacklisted.

Meanwhile, Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin told Ceylon Today that the relevant decision was not influenced by any teachers’ Union, but was done according to the right of the Teachers as per the Circular 5/2022 related to dress codes of employees in public administration. He added according to the Circular 5/2022 related to public administration no one can deny their rights. Stalin stated that yet the majority of teachers wear the saree and if they are comfortable with it they can continue to do so, yet the ones who want to wear other comfortable attire have the lawful right to do.

Only about 1,400 of the best performing students of the Advanced Level Commerce stream would be privileged enough to enter the Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce of University of Sri Jayewardenepura, which is one of the leading and well recognised Management faculties in the South Asian region. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 most of them were restricted to the virtual environment. “We believe that X-Universe would serve as an ideal platform for them to cover up all the excitement they have been missing all this time. The objective of X-Universe is to develop skills such as leadership, team building and confidence of first year undergraduates and to provide them with a platform to create stronger bonds while conveying the vibe of undergraduates to the community.

It added, ‘nine groups will participate and each will have 15 members. ‘Fly pool’ is a game associated with a swimming pool and would pave the opening to the event. It would be followed up by various adventurous, fun, and brainstorming games. Next in line is ‘Star Kitchen’, a vibrant cooking game. It is not just a cooking game, but a whole cooking experience where they would be provided with the chance to prepare delicious meals for their team members. To spice up the competition we decided to include a Carrom tournament. We didn’t miss to provide a platform to all the intelligent souls out there to test their cognitive abilities. “We have got them covered with ‘Tele Brain’, a general knowledge competition. Another very special segment is ‘Galaxy Walk’ which adds a whole new level of diversification to this event. Here is the chance to all the active and adventurous souls to test their physical strength. “Finally, to sum up this amazing event we have ‘Tone Comet’, a Talent show! We invite all the aesthetic souls out there to perform and bring out their inner superstars. X- Universe is one of newest and unique initiatives from the second years of the Marketing Management Department gifted to the first years and with no doubt this would be a major addition to all of our reel of university memories. There is a lot happening behind the screen to make this event a success and all their efforts are highly appreciated. As a prestigious department we are not only focusing on academics but also on co-curricular activities as we believe in producing all-round graduates to the country. This is not only an opportunity for the participants to showcase their skills but also for the organisers too, to come out of their comfort zones while discovering their hidden talents and to gain corporate exposure which would definitely help them to succeed in the corporate world.

By investing in collection centres, which enable direct collection from the farmer and the introduction of refrigerated trucks and improved logistics, the Cargills agri value chain has established itself as one of the most successful in the country. Some of its key achievements include minimising post-harvest loss of fruit and vegetables and eliminating middlemen from the supply chain which ensure a lower price to consumers while ensuring higher prices for farmers. In addition to purchasing milk and agri produce at a guaranteed price, Cargills has improved the productivity, quality and sustainability of farmers’ production, thereby enhancing rural livelihoods and transforming traditional farmers to Agri-Entrepreneurs. In 2008, Cargills established a farmer welfare fund ‘Sarubima’ in Thanamalwila, by contributing 50 cents for every kilogramme of produce purchased from farmers to launch an educational scholarship programme for farmers’ children who excel in Grade 5, Ordinary Level and University Entrance exams. This contribution has continued to date. Furthermore, a part of the fund was allocated for community development projects including, providing access to safe drinking water and building children’s playgrounds in rural schools to name a few. This year, the Cargills’ Sarubima fund will be awarding 774 scholarships worth Rs 25 million to farmer children who have excelled in studies. The awardees include 194 students at Grade 5, 375 at Advanced Level, 158 at university and 47 for Vocational Training. In addition, 32 community development projects have been planned, which include health camps and eye camps for farmers, and water supply and sanitary facility projects urgently required by selected rural schools and hospitals. Since the inception of the fund, over 2,500 scholarships have been awarded to farmer children and over 100 community projects have been undertaken which include water purification projects, school libraries and upgrading sanitary facilities in rural schools. In 2014, the Sarubima Fund was extended to all Cargills vegetable, fruit, and milk collection centres, benefiting over 20,000 agri and dairy farmers across the country. In 2018, Cargills Sarubima took a step towards national agriculture development with the start of the Agriculture Modernisation Project. This project is a model for climate-smart, profitable, and environment-friendly production of a range of GAP certified fresh produce. ‘Sarubima’ is a reflection of the Cargills commitment to empowering rural agri and dairy farmers by creating sustainable markets, building up capacity and nurturing the next generation of farmers. If the soil is not rich and fertile, a good harvest cannot be reaped from that soil. Similarly, for sustainable agriculture, farmers must take care of the soil, nurture it, and conserve it for future generations– Sarubima. Pic by J. Weerasekara"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Dr. Weerasinghe said, he believes the people will understand the difficult decisions that must be made to get out of the present economic crisis. Participating in a ceremony to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Matara Rahula College, he stressed that in addition to managing the economy, he believes that if decision-makers and policy-makers selected the right person for the right job, we could have avoided the present predicament. “Countries will develop only when the right person is in the right place. It will not be successful in a society where untapped talent is unable to advance competitively based on their abilities. We are living in extremely difficult times. It is not easy to recover from the economic crisis. Difficult choices must be made. They are, however, unpopular decisions. When difficult decisions are made, some people will suffer. Decision-makers will be blamed,” he said. Further, he said no matter how many accusations are levelled, if the decisions they make are correct, they are doing the right thing. “Even if there are difficulties in the short term, I hope that people will understand. Even if it is difficult, it’s the right thing. It is hoped that by doing so, we will recover as soon as possible and, somehow, return the country to normalcy, giving everyone a better future,” he said. By Thameenah Razeek"

What will happen though is that our country’s future of 4.3 million students and 0.2 million pre-school children is in jeopardy. Some schoolchildren’s books, stationery, and educational equipment have increased by 500 per cent. So, how could parents get their children to school?

He also said nowadays children could not afford to bring lunch and walk home instead of taking the bus. “When the people are suffering, cultivating marijuana has become the Government’s main discourse today.

Mahathir, 97, who served as Malaysia’s prime minister for more than two decades in two stints, failed to retain his parliamentary seat in the Langkawi island constituency, coming in fourth in a five-cornered fight. The seat was won by Mohd Suhaimi Abdullah, a candidate from the Perikatan alliance, which is led by another former prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin. It was Mahathir’s first election loss since 1969. Mahathir leads a coalition that has vowed to take down the incumbent Barisan Nasional government over corruption allegations. But his alliance is not considered a key contender, with Barisan facing two other major coalitions – Muhyiddin’s bloc and another led by Mahathir’s long-time rival Anwar Ibrahim. Mahathir told Reuters in an interview this month he would retire from politics if he lost. “I don’t see myself being active in politics until I’m 100-years-old,” he said. “The most important thing is to transfer my experience to the younger leaders of the party.” (Reuters)"

Secretary Samarasinghe said the gazette was handed over to Department of Government Printing with the signature of Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera. Amaraweera decided to lift the Glyphosate ban after receiving numerous inquiries from various sectors, including farmers’ representatives, agricultural experts, and agronomists. Glyphosate was banned in Sri Lanka for the first time in 2015 without the implementation of any alternative weed control measures, according to a ministry statement, and it was later banned in tea and rubber cultivation in 2018. “However, some individuals illegally imported substandard Glyphosate by sea and sold it at high prices islandwide. As a result, further Glyphosate ban enforcement is pointless. Furthermore, harvests were reduced because there was no alternative method for weed control in the agricultural sector. Thus, efforts were made to lift the Glyphosate ban, which had been in place since 2015,” he said."

He emphasised that the prices of imported textbooks, notebooks, pencils, erasers, and paper materials used to make notebooks have not been revised as a result of the Cess Tax revision, which came into effect on 15 November. According to the State Minister, the Cess Tax is imposed based on the import value when substitutes for imported items are produced locally. The Cess Tax on imported ballpoint pens, shoes, and bags has been adjusted to reflect the present USD exchange rate. Thus, the prices of these imported items are likely to rise.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Secretary of the GMOA, Dr. Haritha Aluthge noted yesterday (16) that it was more important to be able to practically-implement proposals rather than announcing policies and proposals that cannot be executed. He said that over Rs 321 billion had been allocated to the State health sector through this year’s Budget, so it is essentials the funds are used to solve issues the health service is currently facing – a priority being given to resolving the acute shortage of medicines. “It is the responsibility of the authorities to use the funds efficiently and effectively by fixing the inefficiency and complications, facing the procurement process and eliminating fraud and corruption in the pharmaceutical sector. He noted that the proposal to set up a new medical faculty under Uva Wellassa University in addition to the existing State medical faculties is a positive suggestion. “Thereby it was proposed that the Provincial General Hospital, Badulla as well as General Hospital Polonnaruwa should be upgrade to Teaching Hospitals to raise the quality of healthcare in this country”. The proposal to re-implement ‘paid wards’ in State hospitals have raised questions among the public as even at the moment the concept has been implemented; adhering to certain limitations at National Hospital, Colombo. However, it is highly doubtful as to whether efforts are underway to undermine Sri Lanka’s free health service by this specific proposal as paid wards are being expanded even in base hospitals. Dr. Aluthge observed. Speculations are rife as to whether this is a furtive attempt to privatise the free healthcare system, he said. Dr. Aluthge said the GMOA is of the view that the current economic crisis and food crisis have increased the level of malnutrition among vulnerable population groups. “The Budget for 2023 has identified this situation and in an attempt to address it, an allocation of Rs 500 million was portioned out to further strengthen existing nutritional supplement programmes. However, it would be most effective if those programmes were implemented targeting vulnerable population groups and areas they live in”. BY Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

The Petitioner also sought an interim order directing the respondents to take immediate steps to effect payment of the Petitioner’s salary and entitlements until the hearing and final determination of the application. Thereby, when the case was taken up before Justices Priyantha Jayawardena, Mahinda Samayawardana, and S.

However, due to the failure to comply with the interim order, a Motion was filed stating that the respondents, including the IGP had failed to comply with the interim order and have thereby committed Contempt of Court. Accordingly, the Court issued notice on the IGP and four others to appear in Court yesterday (16) to show cause for the failure to follow the interim order. Additional Solicitor General Nerin Pulle and Additional Solicitor General Chethiya Gunasekera appearing on behalf of the IGP and four others apologised to Court and said the failure was unintentional and that steps will be taken to provide the requisite relief to Mendis.

Russia secured second position with a total of 20.66 million kgs, though, a nine per cent decrease YoY for January-October 2022. UAE sits in third place with a total of 18.32 million kgs followed by Türkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan, and Libya, respectively during the period January-October 2022, it said.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts.

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer.

He said this while addressing a post-Budget conference held at the Central Bank Auditorium yesterday (15). He said some people make different statements regarding the suspension of the country’s external debt servicing, but the external creditors were ready for it long before Sri Lanka officially announced the debt standstill on 12 April. He pointed out that when Sri Lanka temporarily suspended its external debt servicing last April, the country’s total foreign reserves fell to USD 20 million and the country’s credit rating was also in a dire situation. He pointed out that at that time, the Government had no option but to suspend debt servicing on a temporary basis until the country’s total debt was restructured and debt sustainability was restored. For this reason, the Central Bank Governor, said Budget proposals and other economic reform proposals should be implemented to start earning critical foreign exchange to build Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability and ensure that it does not return to crisis. President Ranil Wickremesinghe said in his Budget speech on Monday that the Sri Lankan economy can be turned around by the end of 2023 by following the Budget policies with a long-term vision that is not limited to the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Sri Lanka signed a staff-level agreement with the IMF in early September, but must secure sufficient financial assurance from bilateral creditors, including China and India, to secure disbursements. “The next critical step is to get financial assurance and the IMF programme and additional financial support, so that Sri Lanka can finally get back on a growth path,” Weerasinghe said. He reiterated the need to reform loss-making public enterprises in Sri Lanka. Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana said at the same event that stabilising the economy remains a challenge and that the private sector should play its role in assisting the Government to recover from the crisis. He said, the Government will appoint a presidential committee to monitor and ensure timely implementation of the Budget proposals. Siriwardana also said, Sri Lanka should make a case for cost-based consolidation, not just to rationalise public spending, but also to reduce the size of government and increase taxes. “Increasing income and reducing expenditure should go hand in hand,” Siriwardana said. “On the other hand, there is no point in generating revenue if there is no control on the expenditure side.” He said, a freeze on State sector hiring was ordered in April and strict expenditure control was demanded from State line ministries. “This is the time to act responsibly,” Siriwardana said. We are watching closely and we are seeing results.” However, he said, public services had to be maintained in the short term and taxes had to be raised. He said, the present conditions are painful for businesses as well as the public in general. Siriwardana said, Sri Lanka now has a public sector of 1.4 million people and a presidential commission will review the public sector. Siriwardena also said, the Ministry of Finance is trying to control expenditure and stop money printing. “We need to stop Central Bank financing,” he said. “We should stop printing money and contribute to reducing inflation from the Ministry of Finance.” The Central Bank Governor also said Sri Lanka should stop relying on credit assistance for its funding needs and implement measures to bring in foreign exchange. Addressing chronic fiscal and current account deficits, raising more revenue, and keeping sovereign debt at a reasonable level will all be critical, he said. “The economy cannot be reformed overnight. It is a painful process. The next challenge is to implement the Budget proposals according to a timeline,” the CBSL Governor said. By Ishara Gamage"

He said maintaining one of the world’s largest public sectors is one of the primary causes of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis. Speaking to the media yesterday, he said, the Government, which has been lecturing Parliament about its existence for several months, has created 11 new Government institutions in Budget 2023. “These 11 institutions are not members of non-permanent committees, presidential commissions, presidential task forces, or new institutions formed by the merger of existing institutions.” As a result, the Presidential Commission for Public Sector Reform, the Agency for External Trade, the New Department for Cinnamon Industry Development, the National Development Committee, the Board of Graduate Status Certification and Accreditation, the Uva Wellassa University Faculty of Medicine, the Historical Research Institute, the Institute of State Revenue Management, the Data Protection Authority, the Microfinance Regulatory Authority, and the University on Climate Change have all been established,” he said. He added that when establishing new institutions, new directors, director generals, and support staff should be appointed, and other facilities should be provided. He stressed that, in light of the massive financial crisis, the Government should collaborate with existing institutions. “For example, the University Grants Commission could delegate the functions that the Board of Graduate Status Certification and Accreditation is expected to perform. The work that the Microfinance Regulatory Authority is expected to do can be delegated to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Creating new institutions without doing the work of existing institutions will exacerbate the present crisis,” he said. By Thameenah Razeek"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

GoSL’s face value (FV) MP debt decreased by 0.67 per cent (Rs 21,956 million) to Rs 3,242,285.13 million (Rs 3.2423 trillion) on Monday led by swaps between the GoSL and Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), thereby marginally defraying demand-pull inflationary pressure. GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs 3 trillion for a record consecutive 89 market days to Monday due to a sustained lack of revenue. Market liquidity increased by Rs 73,048 million (USD 200.96 million), led by the settlement of the above mentioned swaps on Monday. Conversions are based on the value of the administered and benchmark official ‘spot’ fixed at Rs 363.50 to the US dollar on Thursday (10 November). Swaps between GoSL and CBSL are foreign reserves-neutral. Market was short for a record 290 market days to Monday, though this shortfall fell by 10.12 per cent (Rs 51,092 million) to Rs 453,655 million, nevertheless causing sustained rate pressure. Meanwhile, GoSL’s highest to the 294th highest FVMP debt has been recorded in the 294 consecutive market days to Monday.  CBSL, which administers daily open market operations (OMO), lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL. GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot.’ The ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and lower the cost of ‘essential’ imports, while ‘essential’ imports are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee, as Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy.  By Paneetha Ameresekere"

He also revealed the plans to appoint Presidential Commissions to review the public service and Tax policy. The presidential commission will review the public service which was consuming most taxes. The Presidential commission on tax will also make recommendations on a revenue authority. The government will also restructure SriLankan Airlines, Sri Lanka Telecom, Sri Lanka Insurance and Waters Edge through a State enterprise reform unit. The proceeds will be used to strengthen foreign reserves, he said. President Wickremesinghe said that the Board of Investment (BOI) and Export Development Board (EDB) would be merged. The Employees Trust Fund (ETF) law would be reformed. The Information Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) would be dissolved. Soldiers who had served for over 18 years would also be given the opportunity to retire on a voluntary basis, he said. The government plans to reform labour laws for an export-oriented economy, the President said. “Labour laws have to be reformed for an export-oriented economy. There are also independent contractors.” The Government would bring a comprehensive law to regulate labour, he said. The President said, that the long-term development of the country (2023-2048) should be based on correct decisions and not popular decisions. “To ensure a better future for the youth of our country, let’s create a new economy tailored to meet the expectations of the youth through a new approach that goes beyond traditional protests, struggles, and strikes, the President said. President Ranil Wickremesinghe assured that the commencement of a new journey, ensuring the lifestyles that the society is familiar with, will not fall to a lower level again. Instead of a lifestyle tailored to per capita income, an economy tailored to the lifestyles of the youth. A new economic foundation should be prepared to match the new trends of the world, he said President Wickremesinghe said, socio-economic transformation should be done taking into account global phenomena, paying special attention to climate change. The President said, the necessary legislative amendments and new Bills for economic transformation would be presented to Parliament soon. It is expected to achieve a high economic growth rate of 7%-8% through the social market economy based on reforms and modernisation.  Excerpts from his speech: “A glimmer of hope on emerging from the economic abyss is currently visible as a result of the strenuous and difficult actions we have adopted during the past few months. After the era of waiting in queues for days and protesting in various occupied places, our sufferings have been eased to some extent and we have reached an era where our peace of mind is much settled. “Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund are currently in progress. We are in dialogue with India and China on debt restructuring. We are confident that these discussions will lead to positive outcomes. “Inflation could be controlled to some extent due to the actions taken in the recent past. Similarly, the rupee is strengthening. We expect to sustain these developments. I am confident that by moving along the same path, we will be able to stabilise the economy within the next year. “But we cannot be satisfied with that. We must start a new journey. “Presenting the Interim Budget proposals last August, I mentioned that the purpose of the interim budget proposals is to lay the basic foundation for transforming the economic pattern that has existed so far in our country. I mentioned there, that the process of building a new economy suitable for the modern world would be started through the budget proposals 2023. “Seventy-five years after independence, can we be satisfied with the status quo? Where did we go wrong? How did we go wrong? “Let’s look back. Let’s take off the colored political glasses. Why did we get it wrong? Where did we go wrong? Did we get things wrong? Or did we got things wrong? Today, our country has several main revenue generating sectors. One is the plantation economy. Next is Free Trade Zones. Garment industry, Tourism and foreign employment. Looking at those, after independence, we have been able to create only a few avenues for the country to earn foreign income. Beyond that, why have we not yet been able to create large-scale foreign income generating sectors? This is something we should think about carefully. “Over the past period, have we been excited and happy for things that will work for the future, or for things that can be seen on the surface for the moment? People were happy when successful private businesses were nationalised. People were happy when free rice was given. Governments that took such “Because of this, we were satisfied with installing an electric lamp on the street. But we did not think deeply about increasing the electricity generation. “Is the long-term development of a country based on popular decisions? Or the right decisions? In many cases, popular decisions were taken instead of correct decisions in our country. Even today many people try to make popular decisions. “What was the result of this popular ruling tradition? To build a relief economy and a relief mentality across the country. People are used to getting concessions. Governments do not work to create opportunities for people to develop. Only to provide relief. “Reminiscing the nineteen fifties, Lee Kuan Yew once mentioned the following. “In Singapore I followed the hard, but right path. Sri Lanka’s Bandaranaike followed the popular path.” “There is no future for the country by continuing on this popular path. There is no prosperity for the country by giving concessions while being in debt to others. So, let’s get out of this situation now. Let’s change our thinking patterns. “So, let’s think anew. Let’s create innovative approaches to move the country forward. Through this budget, we are trying to lay the new foundation of the Sri Lankan economy that can create that force. “Here, I would like to outline some of the main points that we will focus our attention on. Due to the economic crisis we faced in the recent times, the whole country faced many difficulties… couldn’t put the food on the plate for the day. Jobs were in jeopardy. Income was lost. Businesses collapsed. It has not yet been possible to completely get rid of all those difficulties. People faced such difficulties with the hopes of rebuilding the country in their hearts. All of us made those commitments and are still making commitments with the aim of reviving the country. The benefits of the new economy we are building must be equitably shared among all those who are committed to the country. Equal opportunities should be created for all. It is not an economic system that makes only a small group of society rich, but an economic system that elevates the entire society. “When Sri Lanka was a low-income economy, the basic necessities of life enjoyed by the people were minimal. But been elevated to a middle-income economy, standard of living also naturally rose. This is a normal situation. It is the same even at home. As the household income level rises, the standard of living rises. “In preparing the new economic base, we should focus on the lifestyles that the society is familiar with. A new journey must be started so that these lifestyles do not fall to a lower level again. “Especially today’s youth who deal with the world on a technological basis expect their lifestyles to rise day by day. Therefore, it is necessary to create a way of life that stimulates lifestyles that rise day by day through the new economic base. “Therefore, means of livelihood that we should be creating is not that suits the current level of per capita income, a way to raise per capita income to match the lifestyles that young people aspire to. “In this system we focus on taking care of poor and vulnerable groups. It is necessary to examine whether all sections of the society are receiving equitable benefits through health services and free education that is currently provided as well as other welfare programs. And these services should be made more efficient. Maximum benefits should be obtained from the resources spent for this purpose. “If we forget that we are facing a huge economic crisis, we won’t have a way forward. It is by realising the current situation, we need to prepare the way forward. Therefore, in the midst of this crisis, it is important to pay special attention to how our welfare programmes could be implemented more effectively. Parallel to this, entrepreneurs in the private sector should be promoted. Private entrepreneurs in our country continued to grow from the mid-19th century to the mid-1950s. But with the nationalisation of their businesses, private entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka almost completely collapsed. As a result of the open economy introduced in 1977, there were again private entrepreneurs, but they were not adequately provided with the necessary facilities. “Many people in the country did not look at entrepreneurs with a good attitude. Entrepreneurs who contribute to the country’s economy were considered villains. In most of the tele dramas produced in Sri Lanka, the village shopkeeper (‘Mudalali’) was portrayed as an evil character. From the small entrepreneur in the village to the large-scale entrepreneurs, everyone was treated as exploiters. “We must change this situation. Private entrepreneurs should be encouraged. New entrepreneurs should be created. All the necessary facilities should be provided to them. A policy environment should be created to make their work more effective. “While encouraging private sector entrepreneurs, we should focus on regulating economic activities, investing in infrastructure, correcting market failures and maintaining law and order. “I would like to define the new economy that we are going to build as a social market economy, or an “open economic system of social protection”. “In this new economy, we focus on three main things: “An export oriented competitive economy, an environmentally friendly green and blue economy and a digital economy. “Creating such a new economic foundation is a challenging task. Such a new economy cannot be created merely by making changes in the tax system. New sources of revenue should be found. New areas should be identified. Massive economic reforms and restructuring should be carried out. “We hope to base two unique points here; the first – economic reforms and reorganisation and the second – economic modernisation. “Re-examination of the country’s resource base as well as the reorganisation of them is also important here. Education, health, agriculture and marine resources, industry, trade and investment, defence, foreign relations, etc., must all be modernised. We should carry out this socio-economic transformation taking into account the global phenomena. In particular, a special attention should be paid to climate change. “We will soon present the new legislations and legal amendments to the Parliament that are necessary for economic transformation. It is essential to establish a common social agreement for economic management as well as between various parties involved in the industrial and social relations system. Legislature, executive, judiciary, professional groups, mass media, religious groups and various social organisations should be involved for this. This common unity is extremely important to maintain long-term social harmony and to move towards without rapid economic growth without collisions. We expect to achieve following goals, initially through the social market economy or social-security-open-economy that we are creating. – High economic growth of 7 to 8 percent. – Increasing international trade as a percentage of GDP by more than 100 percent – Annual growth of USD 3 billion from new exports from 2023 to 2032 – Foreign direct investment of more than US$ 3 billion in the next 10 years – Creating an internationally competitive workforce with high skills in the next ten years “In order to achieve these goals, we need to create a competitive and high-performance modern economy. A modern, export-oriented, competitive economy led by the private sector…a private sector-led, export-oriented, competitive modern economy. We are starting our journey for that in 2023 with this budget. By the year 2048, which marks 100 years of independence, the background for the new approach and new work order to make Sri Lanka a developed country will be prepared by these budget proposals. “But these budget proposals are different from traditional budget proposals. We are often used to get reductions in prices of goods, salary increases concessions etc. through budget proposals. We would like to see budget proposals that appear to be relief on the surface even if it means indebtedness to the world. We lost our way because of taking that popular route. Now we can no longer go down wrong paths and despair. “If we build the future through the foundation we create through this budget, we will be able to enjoy a comfortable economic environment by the end of 2023. The benefits of that economy will flow to throughout the country. “The economic reforms we are bringing are not limited to the reforms agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund. The economic reforms proposed by the International Monetary Fund are limited to economic stabilisation only. We are doing these reforms and reorganisations to build a new economy. It is a need of the country. Something that the country needed for a long time, a role that many Governments have opted to ignore with popularity in mind. We will play that role for the country.”"

Addressing the gathering during a ceremony held to hand over the houses at St. Antony’s housing project in Bollatha, Ganemulla, Cardinal Ranjith said, Buddhism speaks about the ‘Ditta dhamma wedaniya karmaya’, therefore those responsible for the 2019 Easter attacks would suffer the repercussions of their doings. “You are wrong if you think that the law could be twisted in your favour, act like heroes in the future and wash your hands off. He accused the Attorney General’s Department of being devoid of their sense of smell sight or hearing and therefore doing nothing to execute the recommendations of the Easter Attack Presidential Commission Report. “Although the former President pledged to ensure a free and transparent investigation he called me and asked as to how he could carry out all that had been recommended in the Report once he received it. “Now a herd of deaf elephants have entered the scene and it is quite apparent that there is no point in playing the violin to them,” he lamented.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

He urged Government officials to guide anyone who is interested.       “The Land Reform Commission should take immediate steps to cultivate the uncultivated lands currently held by the Mahaweli Authority and estate companies. The time has come for everyone to come together to end hunger in the country. No cultivable Government land should be left uncultivated. Officials cannot object or disturb cultivation in those lands. These lands are the inheritances of the people,” he said. Speaking at a Ratnapura District meeting on food security and nutrition held at the District Secretariat, he said after the collapse of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1815, the imperialists took possession of prosperous lands in many areas in the upcountry including the Ratnapura District. “Most of the lands that are now under the Government and estate companies are the inheritances that were stolen from those people. The people are asking to cultivate the heritage that was taken away from them to appease the hunger of the country today. This earth can make us self-sufficient with food. We should create an environment to instil confidence in agriculture for new youth entrepreneurs through that. Officials should always provide all support for that. We have to overcome enormous economic challenges that have arisen,” he said. Speaking further he also said Food safety is prioritised in many areas of programmes implemented by the Government. He said the Government has re-established the programme of providing fertiliser, seeds and other materials through the Government’s intervention. “Increasing the amount of cultivated land compared to last season, diverting uncultivated lands to cultivation, returning uncultivated lands for cultivation should be the ultimate goal achieved. We consider this opportunity as one of the main opportunities that the whole country can use for short-term and long-term programmes to win foreign exchange for the country. No need to wait for industries to come. Agriculture can be converted into an industry by producing crops that have a high demand. Until our goal is achieved, we must implement the cultivation of crops for food as well as for exports. We have been able to transform the most difficult time in respect of the economy into change,” he concluded."

Furthermore, train operations are hampered due to derailments in the Dematagoda, Maligawatta, Colombo, Kolonnawa and Orugudawatta railway yards, according to SLSMU General Secretary Kasun Chamara. He said there were 38 derailments in those yards in 2020, 48  in 2021, and 31 so far in 2022. He noted that at the moment, the Railway Department is finding it impossible to obtain railway tracks. “The former General Manager of Railways cancelled the tender that was submitted at the time the relevant parts were to be obtained. However, the tender has been called again by the Minister of Transport and the intervention of the current General Manager of Railways and it is expected that Sri Lanka will receive the goods by March. However, due to the dilapidation of the railway lines, the relevant authorities have taken steps to impose various speed limits on all lines, such as 10 kmph, 20 kmph, and 40 kmph, at certain points, where derailing has occured” he said. Furthermore, he stressed that due to the imposition of these speed limits, train delays occur on a regular basis and this situation has harmed the operation of the coastal railway in particular. “We also believe that this situation arose as a result of the arrival of engines unfit for use on Sri Lanka’s railway lines. So far 296 railway gate wreckages have been reported In the 2020, there were 284 in 2021 and 274 in 2022. Furthermore, the number of accidents caused by vehicle collisions with trains at crossings has been reported to be 58  in 2020 and 2021, with 42 this year,” he said. BY Thameenah Razeek"

He urged Government officials to guide anyone who is interested.       “The Land Reform Commission should take immediate steps to cultivate the uncultivated lands currently held by the Mahaweli Authority and estate companies. The time has come for everyone to come together to end hunger in the country. No cultivable Government land should be left uncultivated. Officials cannot object or disturb cultivation in those lands. These lands are the inheritances of the people,” he said. Speaking at a Ratnapura District meeting on food security and nutrition held at the District Secretariat, he said after the collapse of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1815, the imperialists took possession of prosperous lands in many areas in the upcountry including the Ratnapura District. “Most of the lands that are now under the Government and estate companies are the inheritances that were stolen from those people. The people are asking to cultivate the heritage that was taken away from them to appease the hunger of the country today. This earth can make us self-sufficient with food. We should create an environment to instil confidence in agriculture for new youth entrepreneurs through that. Officials should always provide all support for that. We have to overcome enormous economic challenges that have arisen,” he said. Speaking further he also said Food safety is prioritised in many areas of programmes implemented by the Government. He said the Government has re-established the programme of providing fertiliser, seeds and other materials through the Government’s intervention. “Increasing the amount of cultivated land compared to last season, diverting uncultivated lands to cultivation, returning uncultivated lands for cultivation should be the ultimate goal achieved. We consider this opportunity as one of the main opportunities that the whole country can use for short-term and long-term programmes to win foreign exchange for the country. No need to wait for industries to come. Agriculture can be converted into an industry by producing crops that have a high demand. Until our goal is achieved, we must implement the cultivation of crops for food as well as for exports. We have been able to transform the most difficult time in respect of the economy into change,” he concluded."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Acknowledging that there may be questions raised as to why the Government is focusing so much on the armed forces, and why the Government is looking at Defence 2030, he said that if not, the country will not have a future. “None of us want the armed forces to go to war or to fight anywhere. That is not what we have to do to defend the country. But we are living in a different world from what we were born into. When we were born, there was no tussle for the Indian Ocean. At one stage, no one wanted it. Today it is not so. If we are to survive, the skills, the security skills, Strategic Studies, all that has to be utilised,” he added. The President said, the country cannot have an export-oriented industry unless it has the freedom of navigation. “If goods cannot be moved around, and the freedom of navigation is interrupted, what will happen,” he queried?  “In 2021, we saw what happened when people could not move out of our country and goods could not be transported either by land or sea,” he said. The President highlighted the significance of preparing the armed forces to face future threats while addressing the General Convocation of the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU). He said, the security and strategic skills of the armed forces should be utilised, if the country wants to survive. President Wickremesinghe said, the country’s future depends on its ability to get goods across under situations where the environment we are in will not be one controlled by us. “The actions of other people will impact us in Sri Lanka so we have to use political skills, our diplomatic skills and our military skills to ensure that our right of navigation, the right to come into Sri Lanka and go by sea and by air is not interrupted in any way. So, all these three skills are necessary.  That is why if you are building a country you must also look at the future,” he said. The President commended the KDU for having attained their mark in the civilian streams, where he noted that many prefer to enter the KDU rather than a normal university. To carry that forward, the President said that he had instructed the Ministry of Finance and the Secretary of Defence to look at starting another campus of the KDU mainly for civil subjects, in Kurunegala. He explained that the reason for selecting Kurunegala was because that was the constituency that was represented by Sir John Kotelawala in 1931. Hence, he said that it is appropriate that the people of Kurunegala should get the benefit and the Treasury had already been instructed to set aside monies to upgrade the hospital in Kurunegala to a teaching hospital as well. This, he noted will make Wayamba one of the two Districts in Sri Lanka where there is more than one teaching hospital which is good for the people. “But more than the civilian studies, we also have to look at the future, the future of our country, the future of our security and what role the university is going to play there. I have noted that the KDU has increased their endeavours to ensure that middle-level officers and senior-level officers also receive postgraduate education, either through this institution or the National Defence College (NDC) where many other one-star officers and two-star officers also benefit from it. That is necessary. We should go further. One of the objectives of the Defence University is to ensure that the top leadership and the middle leadership are all educated and their level of leadership is increased so that you have one of the best Military Leaderships in the region,” he said. The President stressed that this is a task that has to be fulfilled."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

It shows PM does not command the confidence of the ruling party, the Opposition leader of the opposition and the Speaker of both parties,” he opined.  In his special statement to Parliament, he said there is one issue and that is the appointment of civil members to the Constitutional Council, adding that they are nominated by the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader and attested by the Speaker. “As MP Lakshman Kiriella spoke on the 17th Amendment to the Constitution, I would like to say that the 17th Amendment, 19th and the 21st Amendments were passed by both the Government side and the Opposition. We have to set up the Constitutional Council. There is seemingly one issue which is not an issue about the appointment of Civil members to the Constitutional Council,” he said. He asked how Parliament could oppose them and if they did, the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader would have no support of the Government side and the Opposition side and the Speaker would not have the support of the entire Parliament. “It is a scenario in which all three should resign. It was the same practice with the 19th Amendment. It’s a procedural event. So, let us have their names. I told the Prime Minister too. Let’s talk it over with the Speaker and get three names. If the Tamil parties nominate, after identifying those who are not members of the SJB, we could solve the issue of the civil nominees. Last time we made appointments from the Tamils as well as Women. This time we could make representation from Muslims and if there are no such candidates, we can allow a female again. After that, all the commissions could be appointed soon and could continue smoothly. Therefore, I request all to assist in this endeavour,” he said. Meanwhile, he also said the IMF Managing Director promised to assist Sri Lanka. He said there is nothing to worry about it and therefore, the discussion with China and India is only needed. “China asked us to commence talks after their party convention. Now talks have commenced. I request both countries to finalise it by the end of December. I thank the Chief Opposition Whip for stating that they would boycott the debate, if they do not know about these matters. So the Government side and the Opposition could pass it,” he said."

He said Sri Lankans have gone through problematic stages regarding food security and thanked the countries that helped. “We won’t have a major issue with food security during next year, hopefully. But Africa is pretty bad, 20 to 30 million people will be affected. There will be a large number of deaths in the Horn of Africa. There is no aid or assistance. It was not discussed. Now, in addition some of them can’t grow food and others can’t get fertiliser to grow food, they haven’t the money, so we have to help them. Secondly, they are affected, especially by the fact that most are in debt. So, in my view, we should give those countries that are having serious problems with food scarcity, the same terms that the IMF gave to Ukraine. Ukraine was fighting a war with Russia. These people are fighting a war for survival,” he said. He said therefore, they should ask the West to give the same support that was given to Ukraine. President Wickremesinghe said to avoid impacts of climate change in the next 20-30 years, South Asian countries should go to COP28 and lock horns with the G20 on the 1.5 °C target by 2050. In a special statement to Parliament yesterday (10), he said according to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in the next 20-30 years the situation will become more serious. “We listened to the Pakistani Prime Minister and we studied the situation where the melting of the Himalayas affected Pakistan. But not only that, Nepal says it is going to affect them, it is going to affect India where the Ganges runs, and it is going to affect Bangladesh because the Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers both flow through Bangladesh. It is going to affect Myanmar because the Irrawaddy River and the San Win rivers flow through Myanmar. It is going to affect the Maldives, which will go underwater and it is going to affect us because part of our Western Coast will go underwater. Even places like Kanyakumari on the tip of South India will go underwater. That is the threat that all of us are facing. But there is no major response on this by world powers,” he said. Further, he said they have to be ready to discuss it with like-minded countries. He said both the Sri Lankan Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Environment can do that. “But those countries are waiting and Sri Lanka has to join them. We must, as far as possible, support it, and on some occasions take the lead on this issue.”"

This will be the framework of the Budget and it will also reflect the economic targets set by the IMF,” he said. Responding to a question, raised by the Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella, on whether the programme which the government had agreed with the IMF would be presented to the House before the Budget, the President said it will be presented after the next round of discussions are completed.  “It won’t be too long as we have to get into tri-party agreements with debtors,” he said. The basis of the discussions with the debtors is to see whether the debt would be written off or whether Sri Lanka would be given more time to settle them, he added. The President requested the Speaker, Prime Minister and the Leader of Opposition to expedite the appointment of a Constitutional Council. “The Prime Minister, Speaker and the Leader of Opposition will have to agree on the names of three civil members who will represent the Constitutional Council. This is just a matter of three names and will not be time consuming. It will be possible to appoint Independent Commissions after the Constitutional Council is finalised and formed,” he said. Also, he said he would meet the MPs representing North and the East soon to discuss the issues pertaining to them. He assured that the legislations pertaining to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Counter Terrorism Bill and the Anti-Corruption Bill will be presented to the House in February next year."

The publication titled ‘Recent Economic Developments: Highlights of 2022 and Prospects for 2023’ further said this highlights significantly worsening nutrition outcomes as official statistics were already signalling issues pertaining to malnutrition, especially stunting, wasting, and underweight in children below the age of five, as early as 2016. In addition to nutritional status, the present economic crisis is also likely to have worsened other disparities that were already prevalent even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, such as access to health and education infrastructure and the asset base of households, CBSL warned. Although more recent national statistics on poverty remain unavailable, there had been a level shift in the district poverty lines over the years, the shift observed between March 2022 and June 2022 is significant with the escalation in prices of all food commodities during this period, CBSL said. For instance, when considering recent poverty line data, in August 2022, the national poverty line stood at Rs 13,460, registering a significant year to date (YTD) increase of 70.1 per cent compared to 2021. Meanwhile, the district poverty line of Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Kegalle and Nuwara Eliya exceeded Rs 14,000 in August 2022, reflecting the disproportionate impact of inflation on cost of living in urban areas, in comparison to Rs 13,004 and Rs 12,870 as observed in rural districts such as Kilinochchi and Moneragala, respectively, CBSL further said. “Well-targeted interventions of sufficient quantity and quality are of utmost importance to help preserve and improve the productive capacity of households over the medium run,” it added. Meanwhile, the share of the population living below the poverty line in 2019 stood at 14.3 per cent, the CBSL publication further said. CBSL further said three years ago in 2019, 3.04 million individuals were living below the poverty line. This was on the eve of the Covid-19 pandemic and the present economic crisis, it said. Prior to the above crises, year 2019 data also highlights the presence of significant disparities across the sectors as well, with poverty levels in the estate sector remaining high at 33.8 per cent in comparison to 15.0 per cent in the rural sector and 6.0 per cent in the urban sector, it warned. The ‘Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2019’ (HIES) 2019, apart from the above findings, also revealed that approximately one in six Sri Lankans was multidimensionally poor and experience deprivations across 42 per cent of selected weighted indicators, it said. The national multidimensional poverty headcount ratios in 2019 were also relatively high at 16.6 per cent in rural areas and 51.3 per cent in estate areas. The people in the estate sector experienced the highest level of deprivation. Among the districts, the lowest incidences of multidimensional poverty were in Colombo (3.5 per cent) and Gampaha (5.1 per cent), whereas the highest was in Nuwara Eliya (44.2 per cent). These poverty statistics from 2019 highlight the vulnerability of a significant share of the population to poverty even before the Covid-19 pandemic. (PA)"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

According to the report, the woman had gone to a Panadura private hospital on 8 November for an ECG test, due to chest pain and the doctor of the same hospital’s Outpatient Department (OPD) informed her that she does not have any medical condition.

According to the complaint, the leads (wires) of the ECG machine attached to the patient’s body were attached to the wrong places during an ECG test, and the test was performed. When one of the sons complained to the hospital, the head nurse called the health worker who took the ECG and confirmed that the ECG was taken incorrectly, when inquiring about how the machine was operated.

When asked whether the Government would postpone the election, he said, the proposal made by the committee should be passed through a parliamentary bill. “If the Bill is passed before the election, the election will be postponed. So claiming that the elections will be postponed because of delimitation committee is incorrect. It takes about a month to bring such a Bill to Parliament and have it passed. Domestic and international pressure is exerted on the Government in this case. Because Sri Lanka is now living under the grace of foreign countries, we must listen to what they have to say,” he explained. In addition, he noted the number one condition of foreign aid is not debt restructuring or state apparatus restructuring, which means holding elections immediately and establishing democracy. “As a result, the Government will only be able to postpone elections for two months. We remind the Government that holding elections at the appropriate time is better,” he said. When asked if a group of the opposition is saying they will join the Government, Gammanpila noted that rumours of switching sides usually start in November when the budget is close.

Premadasa further said, despite the present situation, the Government is attempting to get MPs from different political parties to cross over and no one from the SJB will join the “autocratic government.” “The Government is full of political envy and hypocrisy and is unable to rebuild this country.

He said when more teachers graduated the less training they received. Speaking to the media yesterday (9), Gammanpila raised these facts in the context of three children being harassed by teachers, Principal of a primary school and police officers, for allegedly stealing a teacher’s purse. He stated that incidents like this occur all over the country and that there is a need to find answers as to why these incidents are more common today than in the past. “In the early days, Principals did not go to the police to lodge complaints about students. School issues were resolved within the school. Back then, Principals even solved issues students faced at home. Why is it that what was done then, is no longer being practised today? You cannot become a Science or Mathematics teacher, simply because you have a Degree in these disciplines. Education is a distinct subject. It is possible to become a teacher after studying subjects such as child psychology, teaching methods, communication and group management. Before being sent to a school as a teacher, despite being a graduate, he or she was sent to Mirigama, Giragama, or Katukurunda Teacher Training College and underwent training for two or three years before being sent to the classroom,” he said. Further, he pointed out that earlier as the number of teachers increased, so did training. He emphasised that if someone already had a Degree and passes the competitive examination, he or she was sent to a school for a few weeks of training. “She would not have gone to the police if the Principal involved in the abuse case had been trained in the proper manner. Earlier Principals, determined whether or not a child had stolen the purse based on their expressions and responses,” he said. BY Thameenah Razeek"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

It was disclosed that there were several institutions in the private sector that are allowed to import seed and that the Act does not include a system to control seed prices being imported by these institutions. The members of the committee pointed out that it was a serious situation and it was the domestic vegetable farmer that faced the music as a result and that this was a mafia. Therefore, they said, a system should be put in place to control the situation and enable the domestic vegetable farmer to buy vegetable seed at an affordable price.

In response, officials present elaborated that government departments including the Department of Agriculture was working to produce more local vegetable seed at a subsidised price, but pointed out that certain seeds required different climatic conditions and such seed was imported. Therefore, few private institutions have been allowed to import such seeds. Officials said, hybrid seeds were produced using technology as it could not be produced otherwise. Officials also pointed out that it takes about 10 years to carry out research to produce certain seeds.  COPA Chairman called for a report on obstacles to seed production.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Sri Lankan Catholic Church hoped that in light of what our leaders are doing to those who are struggling to achieve a true sense of democracy and justice for the victims of the Easter Attacks even at the risk of being persecuted, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) took due notice of this and steps to get those responsible to follow internationally accepted norms and procedures to ensure a sense of freedom and justice in this country,” Cardinal Ranjith said in a special statement. He accused the Government for its abusive and unjustified use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, to arrest civil society leaders and those engaged in peaceful resistance to such policies. He also accused the Government of suppressing freedom of speech, expression, and holding peaceful protests. “We cannot accept in any way the unjust arrest and detention of the Convenors of the Inter University Bhikku Federation and Inter University Students’ Federation, Ven. Galwewa Siridhamma Thera and Wasantha Mudalige, The duo had been kept in detention for over 75 days in an unjust manner sans clear accusations and are now reported to be in ill health,” he said. The Colombo Archdiocese also slammed the Government for wasting Rs 90 million on appointing a Presidential Commission to investigate the Easter Attacks in 2021 and storing the findings in the Parliamentary Library. Spokesman for the Colombo Archdiocese, Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando, reading out the statement of Cardinal Ranjith, further added that public funds wasted on preparing a report on Easter Sunday Attacks in 2019 would have been better spent on penning a book. Speaking to the media at the Colombo Archbishop’s House, he said, the Government should have spent the Rs 90 million on hiring a journalist or author to write an investigative book on the 21 April 2019, Easter Attacks and making it available in all libraries, rather than appointing a Presidential Commission to investigate the attacks and then letting its report rot in the Parliamentary Library. “The Presidential Commission performed its task and submitted a report which had enough evidence to act on,” he said, accusing the Government and the Attorney General’s Department of wilfully avoiding acting on the Commission’s report. He alleged that it only appears to be yet another act of corruption and fraud which drove the country towards its present bankrupt situation. “There are certain confidential facts which have been marked as ‘X’ in the commission report indicating that they should not be publicised. But that does not mean that the findings in the remaining five volumes should not be publicised as well. The Attorney General has shown that his establishment is not independent by his failure to implement recommendations given by the Presidential Commission. He should reveal to the public as to why he is unable to implement those recommendations,” Fr. Fernando stressed. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

He added that the Finance Minister is trying to issue casino licences and this is not done in any other country where there is good governance. “There was a law which said that one has to pay 100 dollars to enter a casino. No one who runs a casino took 100 dollars. They didn’t even pay income tax. In the end, the people were taxed and also all those taxes were increased. The problem is not in setting up casinos.

Moving a motion for debate during the adjournment of the House, Dissanayake said the Government should hold Local Authorities Elections by 20 March 2023. “What we have today is not a government of people’s mandate. If you really care about the people’s mandate, the Government should hold elections. We hope the National Elections Commission will hold elections on time without being trapped by various snares set by the Government to postpone elections. We also tell former Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya that all know that the Government is trying to delay the elections by raising an issue of delimitation and ask him not to be complicit in this crime of depriving people of their franchise,” Dissanayake said. He said, the statistics made available to the public by government agencies, international organisations, as well as the media showed a very dangerous situation. As per the latest UNICEF report, 5.7 million people including 2.3 million children need immediate humanitarian assistance. He said, history shows that governments that choose suppression as their mode of governance had been consigned to the dustbin by people. “We demand the Government to tell the world for what reason they are detaining Inter University Students’ Federation Convenor Wasantha Mudalige and Inter University Bhikkhu Federation Convenor Ven. Galewela Siridhamma Thera.” “This suppression by the Government against people will further isolate us in the international community. There is massive social unrest owing to poverty and the Government’s inability to solve the unemployment crisis. In the face of uprisings, people’s anger, and protests, the Government continues to appoint ministers and make use of suppression to hold onto power and keep on stealing. Our country being held by this makeshift government is akin to a ship held by a group of Somali pirates,” Dissanayake said. By Gagani Weerakoon and Aloka Kasturiarachchi"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The distressed boat was spotted on 7 October between Vietnam and Philippine waters, according to Foreign Ministry Public Diplomacy Division Director General Sithara Khan, and those rescued were sheltered in a place called Bung Tan in Vietnam. She added that the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Colombo sought assistance from Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines to rescue them. Khan went on to say that they are still trying to figure out who the migrants are and whether they are all from Sri Lanka. She also stated that the Sri Lanka Consular General will be on the ground in Bung Tan to gather information and report to the Sri Lankan Mission in Hanoi. However, Ceylon Today was able to gather voice recordings sent across where one of the boat people is heard speaking in Tamil saying that there were 317 people on board and that they were sailing as refugees to Canada, but the boat began to sink as rough sea water began to flood their large vessel. They are suspected to be persons from the Northern and Eastern provinces who are facing untold hardships due to the economic crisis. According to the man, there were approximately 50 women and children as well as, many elderly people on board the vessel. “We are refugees and we want to get to Canada, and please spread the word around,” the man said in the recording. When the boat began to sink, the distress signal attracted the attention of a Japanese ship that was nearby in the middle of the sea. “We don’t want the news to reach Sri Lanka.” Our families will be very concerned about us. They’ll be scared,” the man pleaded, adding that they’re all from Sri Lanka. He also stated that they know no one in Canada and that they can sail on a Myanmar flagged vessel.

He has decided to halt human settlement and cultivation of elephant corridors, which is the primary source of conflict between wild elephants and humans, and to prepare all elephant corridors so that wild elephants can travel safely next year. He said the Department of Wildlife Conservation emphasises that Sri Lanka presently has 16 elephant corridors, all of which are threatened by human activity. “These issues have affected elephants attacking villages and people as a result of illegal settlement of people in elephant corridors, the construction of houses and various business places, and the use of them for cultivation. As a result, I directed the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Conservation to begin the process of reopening all elephant corridors to wild elephant movement in the first month of next year,” he said. In addition, he said, as part of the first phase, it is proposed to free three elephant corridors where human-elephant conflicts are raging, and the Government will take steps to evict people who are illegally residing in or near the elephant corridors, provide them with suitable lands for cultivation and settlement, and compensate them. “By freeing the elephant corridors, we can find a solution to human-elephant conflicts. In addition, a number of other joint programmes have been proposed. Other programmes, such as preventing cattle releases into sanctuaries and wildlife parks, removing unauthorised cattle sheds in parks, building electric fences, and implementing an integrated work order, will begin early next year,” he said. Further, he said, human-elephant conflicts have increased due to the neglect of wild elephant habitats during the construction of large reservoirs, as well as the failure to implement decisions proposed to protect wild elephants there. The minister also said, they are working to find solutions to all of these problems."

At COP28, it is of utmost importance that we compile a medium-term plan to ensure global food security,” he said. The President also emphasised the need to work closely with the multilaterals, sources of funding and the need to formulate a sustainable debt relief plan immediately, to ensure global food security. The President further stated that it is essential to finalise this plan by February 2023 and it should be implemented by the end of the first quarter of 2023, if not the damage caused to the political and social structures of countries will be irreparable. He also highlighted the urgent need of compiling a medium-term plan to ensure global food security at COP28. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks while participating at the Round Table discussion on ‘Food Security’ at the on-going COP-27 Conference on Climate Change, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. “There are nearly one billion people who are suffering from hunger today, and according to the IMF, over 300 million people’s livelihoods are in danger. Countries affected fall into two categories, 1. Countries where food is no longer available. These countries either have no means to buy food due to rising costs or are unable to produce their own food. 2. Countries which traditionally had an adequate food supply but now find these sources of food out of reach due to rising costs. There was a time when Sri Lanka had no fertiliser and was unable to produce our own food. However, the successful food security programme is a combined mechanism for food security and the recently accessible fertiliser stocks that was made possible thanks to the international community. Nevertheless, there is a sizeable group who do not have the economic resources to access food. All must ensure that food is made available to countries that fall within these two categories. Secondly, they require financial assistance to provide food for their populations.” Common to both categories is the rising levels of debt servicing. The increasing cost of debt has meant that it is more difficult for the developing countries to ensure affordable food for the total population. The IMF estimates that the food and fertiliser price shock, coupled with the rising costs of debt servicing, will add USD 9 billion to the food import bills of the 48 worst affected countries. This means that a resolution to the debt crisis is needed to tackle both these categories. “Currently we are seeing that there is no overall plan to address this situation and no focal point. The UN together with COP and the FAO, the World Food Programme, the World Bank, and the IMF, must form that focal point. I urge the Secretary-General of the UN and Egypt, as the head of the COP27, to call a meeting of the Ministers of Agriculture of all countries to assess the food requirements of 2023 and 2024 and submit a report on the food position. Working together with the multilaterals, sources of funding and a sustainable debt relief plan must be formulated. It is essential that this plan is finalised by February 2023 and taken up for implementation by the end of the first quarter of 2023.”"

Jayamaha clarified. Dr. Jayamaha when contacted said yesterday (7) clarifying statements issued by certain parties with vested interests said the vaccine is still being developed against the zoonosis viral infection.  He noted that the smallpox vaccine is 30 per cent to 70 per cent effective in preventing monkeypox. However with smallpox being globally eradicated in 1979 the vaccine is still being produced in minor quantities by a very few labs. He noted that although smallpox is similar to chickenpox, the two diseases are from different virus families. Of the seven suspected cases tested by the MRI for monkeypox, three had been diagnosed with chickenpox. “What needs to be noted by the public however, is that while the MRI has a consultant virologist, the World Health Organisation (WHO) approved required reagents and staff to perform real time PCR testing to detect monekypox. The Consultant Virologist urged the public to assist the health services by seeking immediate medical attention – especially if they had arrived from aboard with fever, skin rash in the buttocks, genital area and the body.

But it was only declared a public health emergency in July 2022. He said that fever, headache, swelling of the lymph glands, skin lesions, blisters or wounds and muscle pain are symptoms for monkeypox.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/11/08/lab-grown-red-blood-cells-to-be-transfused-for-first-time/,Lab-grown red blood cells to be transfused for first time,Author not found,0,2022-11-07T20:30:00+00:00,"Manufactured red blood cells were grown from stem cells from donors. The red blood cells were then transfused into volunteers in the RESTORE randomised controlled clinical trial. This is the first time in the world that red blood cells that have been grown in a laboratory have been given to another person as part of a trial into blood transfusion. If proved safe and effective, manufactured blood cells could in time revolutionise treatments for people with blood disorders such as sickle cell and rare blood types. It can be difficult to find enough well-matched donated blood for some people with these disorders. Chief Investigator Professor Cedric Ghevaert, Professor in Transfusion Medicine and Consultant Haematologist at the University of Cambridge and NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “We hope our lab grown red blood cells will last longer than those that come from blood donors. If our trial, the first such in the world, is successful, it will mean that patients who currently require regular long-term blood transfusions will need fewer transfusions in future, helping transform their care.” The RESTORE trial is a joint research initiative by NHS Blood and Transplant and the University of Bristol, working with the University of Cambridge, Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, NIHR Cambridge Clinical Research Facility and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. It is part-funded by a National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) grant. Professor Ashley Toye, Professor of Cell Biology at the University of Bristol and Director of the NIHR Blood and Transplant Unit in red cell products, said: “This challenging and exciting trial is a huge stepping stone for manufacturing blood from stem cells. This is the first-time lab grown blood from an allogeneic donor has been transfused and we are excited to see how well the cells perform at the end of the clinical trial.” The trial is studying the lifespan of the lab grown cells compared with infusions of standard red blood cells from the same donor. The lab-grown blood cells are all fresh, so the trial team expect them to perform better than a similar transfusion of standard donated red cells, which contains cells of varying ages. Additionally, if manufactured cells last longer in the body, patients who regularly need blood may not need transfusions as often. That would reduce iron overload from frequent blood transfusions, which can lead to serious complications. The trial is the first step towards making lab grown red blood cells available as a future clinical product. For the foreseeable future, manufactured cells could only be used for a very small number of patients with very complex transfusions needs. NHSBT continues to rely on the generosity of donors. Co-Chief Investigator Dr Rebecca Cardigan, Head of Component Development NHS Blood and Transplant and Affiliated Lecturer at the University of Cambridge, said: “It’s really fantastic that we are now able to grow enough red cells to medical grade to allow this trial to commence. We are really looking forward to seeing the results and whether they perform better than standard red cells.” Two people have so far been transfused with the lab grown red cells. They were closely monitored and no untoward side effects were reported. They are well and healthy. The identities of participants infused so far are not currently being released, to help keep the trial ‘blinded’. The amount of lab grown cells being infused varies but is around 5-10mls – about one to two teaspoons. Donors were recruited from NHSBT’s blood donor base. They donated blood to the trial and stem cells were separated out from their blood. These stem cells were then grown to produce red blood cells in a laboratory at NHS Blood and Transplant’s Advanced Therapies Unit in Bristol. The recipients of the blood were recruited from healthy members of the NIHR BioResource. A minimum of 10 participants will receive two mini transfusions at least four months apart, one of standard donated red cells and one of lab grown red cells, to find out if the young red blood cells made in the laboratory last longer than cells made in the body. Further trials are needed before clinical use, but this research marks a significant step in using lab grown red blood cells to improve treatment for patients with rare blood types or people with complex transfusion needs. John James OBE, Chief Executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: “This research offers real hope for those difficult to transfuse sickle cell patients who have developed antibodies against most donor blood types. However, we should remember that the NHS still needs 250 blood donations every day to treat people with sickle cell and the figure is rising. The need for normal blood donations to provide the vast majority of blood transfusions will remain. We strongly encourage people with African and Caribbean heritage to keep registering as blood donors and start giving blood regularly.” Dr. Farrukh Shah, Medical Director of Transfusion for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “Patients who need regular or intermittent blood transfusions may result develop antibodies against minor blood groups which makes it harder to find donor blood which can be transfused without the risk of a potentially life-threatening reaction. This world leading research lays the groundwork for the manufacture of red blood cells that can safely be used to transfuse people with disorders like sickle cell.  The need for normal blood donations to provide the vast majority of blood will remain. But the potential for this work to benefit hard to transfuse patients is very significant.” (University of Cambridge)"

The report titled ‘Strengthening Active Labour Market Policies to Drive an Inclusive Recovery in Asia’,  further said, “It is to be noted that this number is likely to be higher when considering those who have permanently migrated amid these circumstances. Another facet of this issue that is yet to be fully investigated and/or explored is the exodus of workers, especially skilled workers, since the beginning of 2022 in the wake of the current economic crisis. As the majority, if not the entirety, of these workers would have benefited from the ‘free education and health’ system, such migration is an irreparable loss to the economy in terms of the high levels of investment made which the economy has not reaped. While this exodus is triggered by the loss of macroeconomic stability, this trend of departures can cause a vicious cycle of worsening instability as continued outward migration will result in the continuous dwindling of skill availability and the economy’s potential, leading to further deterioration of macroeconomic stability, which can trigger another round of accelerated labour exits and so on. Further, as Sri Lanka’s labour market provides little leeway for attracting foreign talent from elsewhere, this outward labour migration will likely hinder the recovery process in the near term and the subsequent progress of the economy into a middle-income one in the medium run. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, followed by an unprecedented economic crisis since early 2022 has further exacerbated many of these existing fragilities and is likely to have created a segment of new poor, due to the significant share of informal sector and low occupational category workers, while suffering from potential learning poverty in the medium term because of issues relating to access to quality education amid the challenges of COVID-19 and the economic crisis. ” It further said,“As the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) sets off on a path of fiscal consolidation, this might be an opportune moment for it to revisit the effectiveness of the provisioning of free universal education and healthcare and to identify means of ensuring that the benefits of such investments accrue to the economy.  Accordingly, to address the several multi-faceted issues prevailing in the Sri Lankan labour market, a concerted effort by all stakeholders, ranging from the GoSL to education sector policymakers, private and public sector education providers and practitioners, and even employers, is needed for Sri Lanka to continue to reap the benefits of the expensive investments that have been made thus far and thereby the existing human capital base of the country. Urgent and focused policy measures are imperative to safeguard this key resource of the economy which will be pivotal to the country’s recovery process in the near-to medium run and thereby the prevention of any scarring of the human capital base.” ADBI is the ADB’s think tank.

A proposal was also made to the Government to discuss issues which we face. After a week or two, there were discussions in this regard but later faded into oblivion,” he said. He said there were representatives to talk about the race they belong to as well as those who represent various religions. “However, people like us, the country’s original owners, have no one to talk about our problems. Currently, the Ministry of Culture looks into our issues but this Ministry does not solely handle our issues but has to deal with other issues as well,” he said. By Thameenah Razeek"

The insect was being carefully studied and the CRI believes that using this insect to control the spread of the white fly insect will be possible in the near future. The Chairman also said, CRI officers from the Govijana Sewa were visiting coconut plantations to advise on how to reduce the spread of the white fly insect. According to reports, the new insect, which was found in the Kegalle area, is mostly found in the Wet Zone. Meanwhile, White Fly infestation occurs in the Kegalle, Kurunegala, Kalutara, Colombo, Kandy, Ratnapura, and Gampaha Districts. It has even caused damage in several areas of the Puttalam District. “Because this insect lays its eggs in the under surface of the coconut leaf, the secretions it produces spread throughout the coconut leaf and severely impair photosynthesis. This has a negative impact on coconut production. Other plants in coconut lands, where the insect is common are also severely impacted by the insect,” he said. Fruits such as bananas, guavas, pomegranates, and flowers have faced the brunt of the infestation. The CRI requested some people to cut down coconut trees where there was severe infestation to prevent further crop damage. Villagers were seeking advice from relevant agricultural service centres, he said. The Chairman said, the CRI could be contacted on 1928 or WhatsApp number 070-4001928 in the event advice was needed.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The harassment in Maricopa County included menacing emails and social media posts, threats to circulate personal information online and photographing employees arriving at work, according to nearly 1,600 pages of documents obtained by Reuters through a public records request for security records and correspondence related to threats and harassments against election workers. Between July 11 and Aug. 22, the county election office documented at least 140 threats and other hostile communications, the records show. “You will all be executed,” said one. “Wire around their limbs and tied & dragged by a car,” wrote another. The documents reveal the consequences of election conspiracy theories as voters nominated candidates in August to compete in the midterms. Many of the threats in Maricopa County, which helped propel President Joe Biden to victory over Trump in 2020, cited debunked claims around fake ballots, rigged voting machines and corrupt election officials. Other jurisdictions nationwide have seen threats and harassment this year by the former president’s supporters and prominent Republican figures who question the legitimacy of the 2020 election, according to interviews with Republican and Democratic election officials in 10 states. The threats come at a time of growing concern over the risk of political violence, highlighted by the Oct. 28 attack on Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband by a man who embraced right-wing conspiracy theories. In Maricopa, a county of 4.5 million people that includes Phoenix, the harassment unnerved some election workers, according to previously unreported incidents documented in the emails and interviews with county officials. A number of temporary workers quit after being accosted outside the main ballot-counting center following the Aug. 2 primary, Stephen Richer, the county recorder who helps oversee Maricopa’s elections, said in an interview. One temporary employee broke down in tears after a stranger photographed her, according to an email from Richer to county officials. The unidentified worker left work early and never returned.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The insect was being carefully studied and the CRI believes that using this insect to control the spread of the white fly insect will be possible in the near future. The Chairman also said, CRI officers from the Govijana Sewa were visiting coconut plantations to advise on how to reduce the spread of the white fly insect. According to reports, the new insect, which was found in the Kegalle area, is mostly found in the Wet Zone. Meanwhile, White Fly infestation occurs in the Kegalle, Kurunegala, Kalutara, Colombo, Kandy, Ratnapura, and Gampaha Districts. It has even caused damage in several areas of the Puttalam District. “Because this insect lays its eggs in the under surface of the coconut leaf, the secretions it produces spread throughout the coconut leaf and severely impair photosynthesis. This has a negative impact on coconut production. Other plants in coconut lands, where the insect is common are also severely impacted by the insect,” he said. Fruits such as bananas, guavas, pomegranates, and flowers have faced the brunt of the infestation. The CRI requested some people to cut down coconut trees where there was severe infestation to prevent further crop damage. Villagers were seeking advice from relevant agricultural service centres, he said. The Chairman said, the CRI could be contacted on 1928 or WhatsApp number 070-4001928 in the event advice was needed.

The 70-year-old was wounded when a man opened fire on his convoy as he was leading a protest march to Islamabad to demand a snap election. He had been pushed out of the premiership amid public frustration at high inflation, rising deficits and endemic corruption Khan had promised to stamp out. Khan was driven from office by what an aide at the time called a judicial coup by the Supreme Court, which overturned his decision to dissolve Parliament and ordered lawmakers to return to the lower chamber. Defections from his ruling coalition meant he lost the “no confidence” vote that followed. That put him among a long list of elected Pakistani Prime Ministers who have failed to see out their full terms – none has done so since independence in 1947. In 2018, the cricket legend who led Pakistan to its only World Cup win in 1992, had rallied the country behind his vision of a corruption-free, prosperous nation respected abroad. But the firebrand nationalist’s fame and charisma were not enough. Ironically for a politician once criticised for being under the thumb of the powerful military establishment, his ouster came amid signs of worsening relations between him and army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa. The military, which has an outsized role in Pakistan having ruled the country for nearly half of its history and won control over some of its biggest economic institutions, has said it remains neutral towards politics.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/11/04/the-underworld-is-much-in-creative-writing/,THE UNDERWORLD IS MUCH IN CREATIVE WRITING,Author not found,0,2022-11-03T20:30:00+00:00,"Hell has three gates: lust, anger and greed.   – Bhagavad Gita Why have I selected to write about the underworld or hell this Saturday? A scary, weird, ghastly subject that causes goosebumps on one’s skin? Because the best book of fiction in the English using and speaking ‘wide world’ is about underworld characters, and worse, those who have been done in and given seven days to find out who did them in. Yes, I have  Shehan Karunatilaka’s   Booker Prize winning  novel The Seven Moons of Maali Alameida in mind. His protagonist wakes up and discovers; he had been murdered and is now – in the first scene – in the underworld with other ‘dead folk’, politically killed persons like Dr Rajini Thiranagama killed in Jaffna by the LTTE in 1989; who registers ‘new dead’ in the underworld. Maali is hinted as thinly veiled Richard de Soyza – reporter, dissident and homosexual. I am wading through the book. I said wading, as opposed to devouring with great interest as the underworld is not my cuppa tea and certainly not dead roaming around looking for their assailants. But it is a great book and highly praised by all the eminent judges and critics. I’ll move from Shehan’s novel to the backdrop of his story. I cannot write about his novel as I am still at the beginning of it. The Underworld The underworld is also known as the netherworld or hell. It is a supernatural world of the dead in very many religions and myths and is thought to be below the world of the living. It has been believed in by every civilisation. Customs and traditions were present, like certain rites had to be performed for the dead to enter the underworld; persons of status were specially dressed to retain their high class ‘down below’. Another concept that persisted was that the dead had to be guided or led or taken over an obstacle, usually a waterway, to reach his/her destination. Thus, the crossing of the Styx in Greek mythology, a river with five tributaries. The Underworld was divided into Tartarus – reserved for worst offenders; the Elysian Fields – for the most excellent persons; the Fields of Mourning – those hurt by love, and Asphodel Meadows  for ordinary persons. It is stated that the descent to the Underworld ‘is the single most important myth of Modernist authors.’ Thus, Shehan is not only a Modernist but also following a certain style or rite of passage, if I may term it thus. Much about the underworld was written by Homer in his Odyssey and Virgil in Aeneid. The former is an epic in which the story of Odysseus, King of Ithaca, sets out to return home after winning the Trojan war and is led out of his way to face adventure after adventure and comes through a hero. Homer was Greek of course and wrote his epic in the 7 century BC.  Aeneid is also an epic poem by the Roman, Virgil, in 24 to 10 BC that details the flight of Aeneas, a Trojan, after the defeat of Troy; he ends up in Italy and is the ancestor of the Romans. Both Buddhism and Christianity have ‘Hell’.  We call it Apaya.  The Christians believe in Heaven where the God is, and all good people go there to enjoy eternal life; the truly evil are pulled down to ‘Hell’. Buddhists have several ‘Heavens’.  Where ‘Hell’ is, is a puzzle since underground is the centre of the Earth, all molten fire. Heavens are believed to be planets that the Buddha envisaged. Personally, these concepts are too difficult for me to fathom. My belief is that Hell and Heaven are on this earth, as circumstances or your past Karma that decree your birth and life. Best left aside and concentrate on following the Dhamma to lead silvath lives.  The Buddha himself said that speculation and worrying about unfathomable topics is a waste of time and energy.   Khalil Gibran noted that Hell is not in torture; Hell is an empty heart. Thus, be kind, good, generous and have plenty of metta and ‘Hell’ will be of no consideration, unless of course, you are a modernist novelist! Kumari"

Addressing the media, Nugegoda Nalandaramaya Chief Incumbent Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thera said Sri Lanka is a country with a 2,600-year-old Buddhist culture and identity. “Buddhist monks, military personnel, Police, school teachers and students have unique uniforms. As required by the CTU Secretary and non-Government organisations (NGOs), they cannot change the uniforms of teachers or students in the country. “If that happens, there is bound to be a great disaster,” Ven. Palitha Thera said. Ven. Palitha Thera noted that even in the Old Testament of the Bible, it is clearly said that women’s clothes should be used for women and men’s clothes for men and that should not be changed, and it is an insult to God. “Therefore, ignoring this custom could be very disastrous to this country and its culture,” he said. Hence, I do not believe Education Minister Susil Premajayantha would allow changing the uniforms of the teachers and students as per the wishes of external sources, Ven. Palitha said. He added, the minister would not take any actions to ruin the culture and identity of the country. Meanwhile, Chief Incumbent of Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte Sri Naga Viharaya in, Rajakeeya Panditha Wathurawila Siri Sujatha Thera also noted that since it is the nature of children to be attracted to the visible things teachers should be careful with their attire. “Since, it is the nature of children to be attracted to the visible things as well as to follow the role models they meet, in the school system, children will naturally follow the class teacher or teacher who is the closest figure to the child. So, teachers as guides should display a very careful behaviour in their role as teachers,” Siri Sujata Thera stated. Siri Sujata Thera stated, “Stalin should remember that this is a Sinhala Buddhist country and we cannot look up to western cultures and try to influence people to follow them. He said if lady teachers are allowed to come to school in comfortable and suitable clothes, the children will not be able to see the exemplary teacher character in the teachers who come to school dressed in different styles. Meanwhile, Sabaragamuwa University Chancellor, Ven. Prof. Kumburugamuwe Vajira Thera noted that teaching service is a unique service beyond the professional level. Vajira Thera said that in the culture of Sri Lanka, which has a long history nourished by Buddhism, teachers are worshiped as gods, and teachers cannot be told to come to school wearing whatever clothes they want, just as monks cannot be told to wear whatever clothes they want. Vajira Thera commenting on previous trade union action on salary anomalies said that the opportunistic trade unions make these god-like teachers walk on the streets and make them look like vagrants. The monks noted that the circular issued in this regard by the Public Administration Ministry on 27 September, does not apply to teachers at all. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

The Prime Minister said this during the 77th Anniversary meeting of the All Ceylon Harbour and Dock Workers’ Union in Colombo on Tuesday (1). The Prime Minister further said, the Harbour and Dock Workers’ Union has made an invaluable contribution to the labour regulations, judicial regulations, and parliamentary regulations on behalf of the working people. “The battles that started in 1946 led to a unique revolution. With everyone’s support, everything started to change due to the actions taken by other fraternal trade unions. This kind of history is not being written for trade unions today. It is not properly established. These rights were won through difficult periods. The eight-hour working day, overtime allowances, pensions, health insurance, and facilities at the workplaces were won through battles,” he said. Speaking further, he said today a union marking its 77th Anniversary is a very rare occurrence. He said it is because they stood for justice and fairness. “This association is alive and well because it did not stand for favouritism. We have faced a very difficult period recently. The port functioned even during the pandemic. Our brothers continued the service with great care on behalf of our country. The Government has done its best to revive the economy. The country’s biggest hurdles will be overcome within the next few months. For that, all citizens should unite,” he said. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The association’s chairman Lionel Herath said that tea manufacturers are penalised by the authorities for everything, regardless of their direct involvement. The chairman further stated that the association’s general meeting held on Monday (31 October) highlighted that the agriculture industry has been exempted from tax for decades, despite the fact that the new tax policy includes agriculture industries, which also needs to be explored by government authorities, because of various setbacks in the tea industry due to many reasons in the past. He also pointed out that since October 2022, tea prices have been declining, and warned that expenditure on production costs could exceed sales averages for producers, resulting in a massive trading loss. He also highlighted a myriad of challenges including the very high and increased electricity bills, high cost of fuel, firewood, packing materials, fertiliser etc. “We hope tea prices will prevail to offset the high cost of production until the country’s economic situation reaches normalcy.” He also pointed out that the main raw material for tea production is quality green leaf but unfortunately, due to many reasons such as high cost, lack of fertiliser in the past, there is a severe shortage of green leaf which has caused a drastic decline in leaf quality resulting in a higher percentage of low-price grades. “Legislation clearly defines the green leaf and all parties concerned should adhere to the Tea Control Act and Tea Board Act. But regrettably, when speaking about green leaf quality, the authorities always pass the ball to the tea factory owners. But we feel that green leaf quality should be monitored at the grower’s farm gate and any corrective action should be taken at the farm level,” he said. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Yet, we want to reassure our external partners that this topic is being looked at with an open mind, and by reference to the principle of fair and equitable treatment of all creditors.”  The foreseen fiscal adjustment should allow the country to bring the primary surplus at 2.3 per cent by 2025 from a primary deficit of 5.7 per cent in 2021, which corresponds to an eight percentage point fiscal consolidation effort in four years, the Ministry document/report also said. “As per the original Budget submitted to Parliament on 12 November 2021, the primary deficit for 2022 was estimated at 2.8 per cent of GDP. But now it’s estimated to shoot up to four per cent,” the Finance Ministry said. The target for next year 2023 is a primary deficit of 0.7 per cent, it added.

The Kebithigollewa Police OIC and four Police officers had gone to Rambakapuwewa to investigate a death following a wild elephant attack on 31 October. At the time of their arrival, at least 150 people had blockaded the road with burning tyres and were harassing passing motorists. However, when the Police approached the crowd to investigate the situation, a group had attacked the Police OIC and a Sergeant who tried to block the attackers.

However, while he was being taken to Anuradhapura hospital his health had turned critical and he was admitted to the Madawachchiya Hospital where he was pronounced dead on admission. The deceased was Angampodige Sunil, a 54-year-old father of two from Wariyapola. The individual who was attacked by a wild elephant was a 48-year-old named Baddaralage Gunasinghe, a resident of Rambakepuwewa. Gunasinghe had taken a bus from Kebithigollewa town to his house but had gotten off at the Rambakepuwewa junction and was walking a short distance to his village when a wild elephant attacked and killed him at around 7.20p.m. on 31 October. After the death of the villager, the locals had blocked the Kabithigollewa-Padawiya main road at Rambakepuwewa and started a protest against the Wildlife Department and the KabithigollewaPolice.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The NCE said, Sri Lankan consumers are sinking, with over 50 per cent of households unable to afford essential food items. The quality of life of an average Sri Lankan is fast declining. According to a latest report released by the University of Peradeniya, 42 per cent of Sri Lankan households or 9.6 million people are in poverty. In a statement, the NCE pointed out that considering the fact that any Government should be given a considerable period of time to bring back a fraught economy to normalcy, ruling parties must come up with immediate solutions to address the most perilous issues at hand. “The time is right to implement robust economic drives, including implement mass agriculture to ensure food safety, control corruption, establish political stability, and importantly to sign Free Trade Agreements with countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and China and penetrate on the existing FTAs with India and Pakistan for improved bilateral relations and harness support from neighbouring countries. As IMF has very clearly pointed out, we have to focus on stringent implementation of clear policies and work tirelessly with one vision to bring Sri Lanka back to its glory,” he said. The NCE urged the President and the Cabinet to provide solutions immediately which is the need of the hour, regardless of who is in power. “The NCE is committed to support the authorities to engender change in rebuilding our economy through exports,” they said. Also, the NCE made a special appeal to the Government to take prompt action in reconciling all affected areas of the country. The IMF has detailed measures to help Sri Lanka restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability whilst safeguarding financial stability. In this context, eradicating corruption by political, state, and other parties are also mandatory to unlock Sri Lanka’s growth potential. Also, establishing stronger and strategic relations with other countries will definitely support Sri Lanka in its path to recovery, they said."

SEDR is a four-year access to justice project implemented by the British Council, in partnership with The Asia Foundation (TAF), and funded by the European Union (EU). The EUR 7 million project is part of the EU’s over arching STRIDE (Strengthening Transformation, Reconciliation and Inclusive Democratic Engagement) Programme in Sri Lanka. SEDR’s Result Area 4 includes an activity to support the administrative functions of mediation boards through the provision of IT equipment. This is with the objective of supporting newly appointed Development Officers to collate data. Under SEDR’s Result Area 1, significant work has already been done to enhance the MBC’s website and building a mediation database to help the MBC function more seamlessly and to be able to monitor progress. The website will help with public awareness and will increase much needed access to mediation, which is more cost-efficient and sustainable when compared with litigation. Speaking at the event, Deputy Head of Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Lars Bredal said, “The EU stands with Sri Lanka in its efforts to ensure everyone has access to justice. As digitalisation plays an increasingly important role in all facets of modern society, it is relevant to the functioning of the justice system, as it allows for improved access and delivery of justice services. We hope the provision of this equipment will be instrumental in facilitating and strengthening the work of the officers of the MBC.” An ICT Needs Assessment survey of 235 MBC staff, including the new cadre of Development Officers (DOs) – Mediation – was completed in the second half of 2021, and a training needs analysis was also done by a consultant hired by SEDR. The scope and focus of the ICT equipment to be procured was made with agreement between the MBC, Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and SEDR joint committee being that the best option was the provision of 70 laptops. The British Council IT team completed the task of installing software (Windows 10) on these laptops, which also all come with SEDR-branding and carrier bags. As part of the distribution process of these laptops, SEDR will work in close liaison with the MBC and MOJ to design and present an online basic orientation training session, to ensure the 70 new users are enabled to obtain maximum benefit from both the new ICT hardware and software. SEDR will furthermore support an additional online training session for new users, specifically focussing on how best to use the new equipment as part of the MBC’s new online mediation database/platform."

The report further said that revenue measures to support fiscal consolidation and annual budget for 2023 in line with the IMF’s USD 2.9 billion assistance programme is being targeted, the introduction of formula-based price adjustments for fuel and electricity is in line, the introduction of a new Central Bank Act and amendments to the Banking Act to enhance Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) powers and measures to support prices and financial sector stability are also to be targeted. “Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) is committed to adopting a new Central Bank Act that will further strengthen the autonomy of the CBSL and to refrain from any monetary financing,” it added. “IMF is considering both liquidity and solvency indicators to assess Sri Lanka’s debt situation. These targets will be dealing with our overall debt-to-GDP trajectory and levels, our yearly gross financing needs and foreign exchange (FX) denominated debt service expressed as a percentage of GDP. The indicative targets assigned to Sri Lanka were determined by the IMF staff team in accordance with the new Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Framework for Market Access Countries. These targets cannot be publicly disclosed at this stage but will become public once the USD 2.9 billion facility is approved by the IMF Board,” the Finance Ministry further said. “We have started to share information on our IMF programme parameters and debt sustainability assessment in more details with the advisers to bondholders on a confidential basis under Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA),” it added.

The Kebithigollewa Police OIC and four Police officers had gone to Rambakapuwewa to investigate a death following a wild elephant attack on 31 October. At the time of their arrival, at least 150 people had blockaded the road with burning tyres and were harassing passing motorists. However, when the Police approached the crowd to investigate the situation, a group had attacked the Police OIC and a Sergeant who tried to block the attackers. The OIC had fired warning shots in the air to control the crowd but the Sergeant sustained critical injuries following the brutal assault. The victim was rushed to the Kebithigollewa Hospital and was transferred to the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital for further treatment. However, while he was being taken to Anuradhapura hospital his health had turned critical and he was admitted to the Madawachchiya Hospital where he was pronounced dead on admission. The deceased was Angampodige Sunil, a 54-year-old father of two from Wariyapola. The individual who was attacked by a wild elephant was a 48-year-old named Baddaralage Gunasinghe, a resident of Rambakepuwewa. Gunasinghe had taken a bus from Kebithigollewa town to his house but had gotten off at the Rambakepuwewa junction and was walking a short distance to his village when a wild elephant attacked and killed him at around 7.20p.m. on 31 October. After the death of the villager, the locals had blocked the Kabithigollewa-Padawiya main road at Rambakepuwewa and started a protest against the Wildlife Department and the KabithigollewaPolice. The protesting villagers said, “When the elephant came to the village in the morning, no one from the Police or the Wildlife Department came even though we made phone calls requesting them to drive the elephant away. And now that a person is dead, they have come to see what happened.” Following the heated situation, 15 persons were arrested in connection with the death of the sergeant. The suspects are aged 20 to 30 and are residents of Rambakepuwewa. Among the suspects is a monk who served in the Army for a time before deserting.

The NCE said, Sri Lankan consumers are sinking, with over 50 per cent of households unable to afford essential food items. The quality of life of an average Sri Lankan is fast declining. According to a latest report released by the University of Peradeniya, 42 per cent of Sri Lankan households or 9.6 million people are in poverty. In a statement, the NCE pointed out that considering the fact that any Government should be given a considerable period of time to bring back a fraught economy to normalcy, ruling parties must come up with immediate solutions to address the most perilous issues at hand. “The time is right to implement robust economic drives, including implement mass agriculture to ensure food safety, control corruption, establish political stability, and importantly to sign Free Trade Agreements with countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and China and penetrate on the existing FTAs with India and Pakistan for improved bilateral relations and harness support from neighbouring countries. As IMF has very clearly pointed out, we have to focus on stringent implementation of clear policies and work tirelessly with one vision to bring Sri Lanka back to its glory,” he said. The NCE urged the President and the Cabinet to provide solutions immediately which is the need of the hour, regardless of who is in power. “The NCE is committed to support the authorities to engender change in rebuilding our economy through exports,” they said. Also, the NCE made a special appeal to the Government to take prompt action in reconciling all affected areas of the country. The IMF has detailed measures to help Sri Lanka restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability whilst safeguarding financial stability. In this context, eradicating corruption by political, state, and other parties are also mandatory to unlock Sri Lanka’s growth potential. Also, establishing stronger and strategic relations with other countries will definitely support Sri Lanka in its path to recovery, they said."

SEDR is a four-year access to justice project implemented by the British Council, in partnership with The Asia Foundation (TAF), and funded by the European Union (EU). The EUR 7 million project is part of the EU’s over arching STRIDE (Strengthening Transformation, Reconciliation and Inclusive Democratic Engagement) Programme in Sri Lanka. SEDR’s Result Area 4 includes an activity to support the administrative functions of mediation boards through the provision of IT equipment. This is with the objective of supporting newly appointed Development Officers to collate data. Under SEDR’s Result Area 1, significant work has already been done to enhance the MBC’s website and building a mediation database to help the MBC function more seamlessly and to be able to monitor progress. The website will help with public awareness and will increase much needed access to mediation, which is more cost-efficient and sustainable when compared with litigation. Speaking at the event, Deputy Head of Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Lars Bredal said, “The EU stands with Sri Lanka in its efforts to ensure everyone has access to justice. As digitalisation plays an increasingly important role in all facets of modern society, it is relevant to the functioning of the justice system, as it allows for improved access and delivery of justice services. We hope the provision of this equipment will be instrumental in facilitating and strengthening the work of the officers of the MBC.” An ICT Needs Assessment survey of 235 MBC staff, including the new cadre of Development Officers (DOs) – Mediation – was completed in the second half of 2021, and a training needs analysis was also done by a consultant hired by SEDR. The scope and focus of the ICT equipment to be procured was made with agreement between the MBC, Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and SEDR joint committee being that the best option was the provision of 70 laptops. The British Council IT team completed the task of installing software (Windows 10) on these laptops, which also all come with SEDR-branding and carrier bags. As part of the distribution process of these laptops, SEDR will work in close liaison with the MBC and MOJ to design and present an online basic orientation training session, to ensure the 70 new users are enabled to obtain maximum benefit from both the new ICT hardware and software. SEDR will furthermore support an additional online training session for new users, specifically focussing on how best to use the new equipment as part of the MBC’s new online mediation database/platform."

Meanwhile, Cabinet approval has been received to sell 49 per cent of SriLankan Airlines’ catering and ground-handling operations, but is yet to obtain Parliamentary approval, Ceylon Today learns.

Mahalakotuwe Wimaladhamma Thera, says that he had requested the  Anunayake of the Malwathu Chapter, of the Sri Dalada Maligawa, Ven. Dimbulkumbure Sri Saranankara Wimaladhamma Thera, to urge the Mahanayaka Theras of the Malwathu, Asgiriya and Amarapura Chapters, to enact laws to prevent members of the Buddhist Clergy from contesting national elections. Ven. Wimaladhamma Thera revealed this during an event held at the Sri Sumana Sama Temple in Ukuwela recently. He stated that the Mahanayaka Theras should urgently take a firm decision to bar Buddhist Monks from contesting Presidential, Parliamentary, PC and LG Polls, or else warned it would be to the detriment of the Buddha Sasana. He added that members of Clergy from other faiths do not venture into party politics unlike Buddhist Monks and that the Buddha had never preached that the Maha Sangha could be actively involved in politics. The Thera observed that the duty of Buddhist monks 24/7 is to spread the Dhamma and to proffer sound advice to the masses to rid the society of its present day ills rather than hanker after materialistic joys.

But, I am confident that a solution can be found to the rising cost of fuel when the economy is back to normal. There are still so many outstanding issues in the fisheries sector. These issues must be resolved as soon as possible. Due to the organisational inefficiency at certain fishery harbours, the fishermen are facing a number of difficulties. I plan to resolve every one of them by visiting district by district,” the State Minister said.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

HRB is seeking full payment of the principal and interest on the July 2022 Bonds and an order barring Sri Lanka from paying other debts in the meantime. Sri Lanka is vigorously defending itself in this action. The July 2022 Bonds were issued in July 2012.” The document also said that debt owed to The Asian Clearing Union amounted to USD 1,917 million as of end June 2022, It  further said that certain amounts on Sri Lanka Development Bonds ( SLDBs) equivalent to USD 96 million, i.e., both principal and interest, were settled in  Sri Lanka rupees shortly after the implementation of  stopping foreign debt repayments as an interim debt policy, “as these limited amounts were still consistent with Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL’s) monetary objectives at that time.” It further said, “Given the current debt situation, Sri Lanka currently relies on domestic financing and a few limited external sources of financing such as some emergency credit lines from key international partners for essential imports. Given the current scarcity of external sources of financing and the necessity to ensure a swift economic recovery, the Government is doing their utmost efforts to have the envisaged USD 2.9 billion IMF programme approved as soon as possible, which in turn will enable Sri Lanka to access much needed new financings from the IMF, other international financial institutions (IFIs) and some official bilateral partners.” It also said that garment exports in particular, thus far have seen good results and are expected to sustain this performance up to 2024.

Last week, China’s National Bureau of Statistics delayed the release of GDP and other economic indicators. However, the Bureau did not give any explanation why it was postponed from the scheduled date, 18 October, the Washington Post reported. If released on the scheduled date, the release would have coincided with the much-anticipated Communist Party Congress meeting in Beijing which saw Chinese President Xi Jinping securing an unprecedented third term on the top post. The bureau on Monday (31), reported that the GDP grew 3.9 per cent between July and September of this year which is below the Chinese Government’s annual target of “around 5.5 per cent.” “China’s official economic data are political first, economic second. Last week’s delay in the release of these numbers and then the curiously upbeat GDP figures at the close of the Party Congress underscored this point yet again,” said Shehzad Qazi, managing director at China Beige Book, which collects and analyzes data on China’s economy, reported Washington Post. Following the data release, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index plunged 6 per cent to levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Composite indexes both fell by about two per cent. Xi Jinping’s tightened political control in China has posed several challenges to his leadership as the communist nation is facing a dark economic picture while economic and social inequality continue to increase. The crisis in China due to stringent lockdowns has triggered hopelessness among the country’s masses and has only added to the political challenges for Xi Jinping. Nathan Levine and Johanna Costigan, writing in Nikkei Asia further said the control in China, since the days of Mao Zedong has been maintained by what he famously described as “the gun” (the military), “the pen” (propaganda) and “the knife” (the internal security apparatus). China is one of the last places in the world still enforcing stringent zero-Covid measures. The heavy-handed approach has seen dozens of neighbourhoods across Shenzhen identified as “high-risk areas,” and placed under strict lockdown orders. In the last two years, while the rest of the world rose to the occasion and meandered its way through the global health crisis, China has clung to its futile attempt at feigning control over an impossible situation. Many people have been unemployed and underemployed, especially in service industries, due to the repeated lockdowns in different parts of the country. (ANI)"

Steps will be taken to review the plantation economy that could be affected by people leaving the plantation areas after completing their education. More and more educated persons are leaving the plantation sector,” he said. Speaking further, he said the Government has to find jobs for them as well as for Sinhalese and Muslims who resettle. The Government also has to look at the future of the groups that will continue to live in the plantation sector and how to improve the plantation economy, as they cannot be allowed to live at subsistence level. “These issues will be gradually rectified in the coming years as the Government resolves the ethnic problem in Sri Lanka. The Government will take further steps to ensure that Upcountry Tamils will have the same facilities as other people in the country as realised and worked on under late President J.R. Jayewardene’s tenure,” he said.    Wickremesinghe also requested all leaders of the Upcountry Tamils to join in this endeavour to ensure that all benefits of Sri Lankan citizenship are enjoyed by the people in the Upcountry. The consignment of medicines was officially handed over to the President by Secretary General of the Ceylon Workers’ Congress (CWC) and Parliamentarian Jeevan Thondaman in memory of the late Saumyamoorthi Thondaman who passed away 23 years ago on 30 October. The consignment of medicines was later handed over to Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella. The President also appreciated the service rendered by late Thondaman and said he was one of the most outstanding leaders of the 20th century in Sri Lanka, as through nonviolence he achieved citizenship for all the people of Indian Origin who stayed back after the Sirima-Shastri Pact. The President said he (Thondaman) got citizenship for some people who should have left under the Sirima-Shastri Pact, but decided to stay in Sri Lanka. Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, a representative from the Indian High Commission, and several members of CWC including Senthil Thondaman were present at the occasion."

Expressing his views on diplomatic relations and mutual understanding between the U.S. and Sri Lanka during the separatist war, the President also recalled with gratitude the support given by the U.S. under the leadership of George Bush in 2001 during his tenure as Prime Minister. The President also recalled the support given by the US government led by Bill Clinton to help Sri Lanka recover from the tsunami disaster in 2004 and said if not for President Joe Biden’s intervention, Sri Lanka would not have had a success of the Maha season.    President Wickremesinghe said he appreciated the support rendered by the U.S. to prepare the first monetary law and the establishment of the Central Bank which was included in the 74-year US-Sri Lanka partnership. Having experienced such a long and cordial relationship, Sri Lanka and the U.S. will work as close friends in the future as well, the President said adding that the U.S. and Sri Lanka were inseparable partners and will forge ahead to preserve peace and democracy. “When I became the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1977, it was an important era when President Ronald Reagan, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Prime Minister Nakasone gave me the support together with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.  It was a turning point that contributed to the last geopolitical changes which took place in 1989 with the collapse of the Soviet Union.  I remember in 1993 when I went to the UK it was because Vice President Al Gore wanted me to sign an agreement including Sri Lanka to the internet. Imagine what would have happened had I not gone and didn’t sign. I is a long standing friendship. I also must mention the help given by President George W. Bush when I was Prime Minister in 2001. We have not forgotten the assistance that has been rendered so far and as Prime Minister I had your assistance to restore democratic principles and uphold the rule of law and freedom of expression,” he said, Wickremesinghe said, Sri Lanka was committed and will not move away from that. “The two countries will always be together. This new building is a symbol of a new era in where the relationship will develop. When the Indian Ocean is the focus of attention, and how fast geopolitics is changing,  we will have to carry out our new relationship and work together as in the past., I have no doubt that we will respect each other and work closely to uphold peace and democracy,” he said."

He said, they were responsible to check purchasers to the home, what is in the house, and what was brought to the house recently. “Reports circulate that televisions in the President’s official residences in Kataragama and Anuradhapura had gone missing. I do not want to take ‘broken’ televisions from official residences because I do not have the financial means or the policy to do so. I am comfortable speaking in front of a crowd of 100,000 people. I challenge anyone to prosecute me if during my tenure as a Minister or President I have committed irregularities,” he said. Further, Sirisena said if someone is carrying out his job honestly, that person could go wherever he or she wants. He said working instinctively and having a love for the public should be maintained at all times. He said it was a futile exercise to go after people and finding out the reason for all the wrong things that have hapened.  “Our only concern is how we will pull the country from the disaster it is facing. Those not involved in any type of corruption should be given the reigns, if the country is to be revitalised. Public representatives who enter Parliament commit 70 per cent of the corruption during their tenure. No ordinary citizen is in favour of what Parliament is doing,” he said. Sirisena said Parliament and the common man were at logger heads. He also said if at least 100 educated MPs came to Parliament, it would not take long to revive the country. BY Thameenah Razeek"

She said while the previous rule stated that mothers could travel abroad once their children reached the age of five, this was changed to two years due to a proposal presented by some ‘moron’. “We must keep in mind that children are more valuable to the country than dollars. If the law relating to mothers who go abroad leving children under two years is not repealed, our children, mothers, and the country will surely perish.

MP Yadamini Gunawardena also highlighted the damage caused to dolphins and blue whales by explosives in the sea around Kalpitiya and Puttalam. Due to this, the marine ecosystem is severely damaged and affects the development of the fishing industry. Many tourists visit Sri Lanka to watch dolphins since they can be seen in the ocean around Sri Lanka, he said. The Prime Minister instructed discussions with the fishermen regarding the harm caused to the ocean system and the country’s economy including the agreements reached in this regard. Devananda said the report will be handed over to the Prime Minister in two months and then submitted to Cabinet.

The Minister gave these instructions following an inspection tour of the ECT. At a meeting where SLPA’s Management officials, Project Engineers, Operation Officials, trade union representatives and staff of several other sectors participated, the Minister urged that suggestions should beused productively. He said the reason for the inspection was to identify delays and the recent slowing down of construction work and resolve them. “I was made aware that delays were due to the dollar crisis in the country which has affected on time payments. I am pleased with the construction already completed and the progress achieved so far amidst these issues. We are taking measures to resolve the matter. I am confident that with such measures, the project could be completed on time. I would instruct the SLPAto expedite the process,” he said. Silva said he will consider proposals brought in by trade unions and expedite the purchase process for the three gantries that have been ordered.  The Minister said the gantries will be set up at the completed section of the terminal and will help to expand operations.  “The terminals are set up in prime locations of the Port.  It is a resource not only to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority but also to the country as a whole. We can generate immense foreign revenue with the correct utilisation of this terminal. A 570m quay bund of the ECT which commenced under the   Colombo Port Expansion Project has already been completed and currently a 440m quay facility is available to handle mega scale container vessels. The terminal has a depth of 18 to 20 metres, enabling easy operation of mega container carriers. The project is scheduled to be completed in January 2025."

The BASL said that the 21st Amendment to the Constitution does not completely restore the status quo which prevailed prior to the 20th Amendment to the Constitution and does not place adequate checks and balances on the powers of the Executive President. The BASL noted that the necessity to amend the Constitution arose as a result of the public outcry that sprang up throughout the country in response to the present economic crisis, adding that it has been perceived that the causes of the crisis included the lack of checks and balances on the powers of the Executive including the Executive Presidency. ‘’The BASL in its previous statements on the 22nd Amendment Bill highlighted the shortcomings of the Bill and of the danger that the nominations of a majority of members to the Constitutional Council will be controlled by the party or parties in the Government, resulting in it lacking independence and consequently affect the independence and integrity of the offices and institutions to which appointments will be made through the Constitutional Council,’’ the BASL observed.  Nevertheless, now that the 21st amendment is enacted into law, it is essential that the Constitutional Council, which is to be appointed there under and the Independent Commissions, which will be reconstituted thereafter, be independent, impartial and be institutions which will help restore confidence in Sri Lanka and its Institutions, they said.

The LSSP demands that the Government scrap the entire Constitution and replace it rather than amending it the whole time,” Tissa Vitarana said. Addressing the media, LSSP General Secretary MP Prof. Tissa Vitarana said he has been unfairly attacked by some media outlets for not voting in Parliament on the 22nd Amendment on 21 October. “I participated in all the debates and discussions that were held in Parliament regarding the 22nd Amendment and I even spoke to many parliamentarians, and I believed that many ruling party and opposition party parliamentarians would vote in favour of the 22nd Amendment. As a result, I attended the N.M. Perera Centre meeting that was held on the same day to discuss the  future of the building. We decided to sell half of the N.M.

The 193-member UN General Assembly on Monday voted on a motion by Albania that action on the draft resolution that would condemn Russia’s “illegal so-called referendums” and “attempted illegal annexation” of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine be taken by a recorded vote. Russia had demanded that the resolution be voted upon by secret ballot. Moscow’s demand for a secret ballot was rejected after 107 UN member states, including India, voted in favour of a recorded vote. Only 13 nations voted in favour of Russia’s call for a secret ballot while 39 abstained. Russia and China were among the countries that did not vote. After the motion to hold a recorded vote was adopted, Russia appealed against the ruling of the President of the General Assembly. A recorded vote on Russia’s appeal was held and India was among the 100 nations who voted against the challenge made by Moscow. Russia then sought reconsideration of the decision to adopt the motion submitted by Albania for a recorded vote. The General Assembly decided not to reconsider the motion after 104 nations, including India, voted against such a reconsideration, while 16 voted in favour and 34 abstained. Russia’s Permanent Representative Vassily Nebenzia said the UN membership had “become witnesses to an outrageous fraud in which the President of the General Assembly, unfortunately, played a key role.” “We were not given the floor to make a point of order (the indicator light at our seat is still on), our statement was distorted, and now UN Member States are being robbed of their right to express their opinion freely. “This is an unprecedented manipulation undermining the authority of the General Assembly and the United Nations as a whole. Of course, in such circumstances we opted to not take part in the vote,” he said. India last month had abstained while Russia vetoed a draft UN Security Council resolution tabled by the US and Albania to condemn Moscow’s “illegal referenda” and declared the annexation of four Ukrainian territories as invalid. The 15-nation UN Security Council had voted on the draft resolution on “Illegal So-Called Referenda in Ukraine,” hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin in a ceremony in the Kremlin had signed treaties to annex the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. The resolution failed to get adopted as permanent UNSC member Russia vetoed it. Of the 15-nation council, 10 nations voted for the resolution and China, Gabon, India, as well as Brazil abstained. Following Russia’s veto, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield vowed to continue to pursue accountability at the United Nations in the General Assembly, where every country has a vote. UN General Assembly President Csaba Korosi reconvened the emergency special session on Ukraine where a senior US Administration official had said the European Union, on behalf of a cross-regional drafting group of several dozen UN member states, was working on a resolution to be introduced in the assembly and considered at the emergency special session to condemn Russia’s actions as a clear violation of the UN Charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The draft resolution would repeat the demand that Russia withdraw its forces from Ukraine and from the war-torn country’s internationally recognised borders and cease its unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. The resolution would also call upon all states, international organisations, and United Nations specialised agencies not to recognise any alteration by Russia of the status of any or all of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk or Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognising any such altered status. The action in the UNGA came hours after Russia carried out strikes against multiple Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv where at least 10 people were killed and around 60 others wounded across Ukraine. In New Delhi, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the escalation of hostilities was in no one’s interest and noted that India stood ready to support all such efforts aimed at de-escalation of the situation. “India is deeply concerned at the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, including the targeting of infrastructure and deaths of civilians,” he said, urging the immediate cessation of hostilities. India has not yet condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and maintained that the crisis must be resolved through diplomacy and dialogue.

Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture Mahesh Gammanpila, stated that they had negotiated with the Chinese company to provide liquid organic fertiliser to replace the shipment contaminated with Erwinia bacteria which was rejected by the Department of Agriculture’s National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS) last year. However, the Chinese company rejected that decision. The granular organic fertiliser was not allowed to enter the country and was returned to China, which triggered controversies and a diplomatic dispute between Sri Lanka and the Chinese Embassy in Colombo. The Chinese mission stated that the NPQS final decision was a fabricated and refused to accept the returned shipment. The USD 6.9 million payment remains with the Chinese company, which even sued the NPQS in November for USD 8 million. The Chinese company demanded USD 8 million, claiming that the samples had been cleared before export and that the Sri Lankan authorities have read wrong test results.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

In a letter to the Speaker, Rajapakshe said, “During the speech, Sumanthiran said the determination of Supreme Court on the Amendment Bill was not according to the Law. He also said the Supreme Court changes its stance from time to time and therefore, it should be ‘sent home.’ This is indirectly saying that the determinations and the judgements of the Supreme Court should not be trusted and the existence of the Supreme Court was also unnecessary,” Rajapakshe said. Rajapakshe said the Select Committee should present its report to the House in three months after the first meeting. The Minister said, according to Standing Orders, without a proper proposal, one should not criticise the Courts or Judges. “This MP has tried to create a dispute between the Court and Parliament. He should not have made such a statement. Due to this, the trust of the people on the Judiciary has been damaged. Sumanthiran is a President’s Counsel and as such, he is setting a wrong precedent for society. He used MPs’ privileges as a shield. Due to such statements, people could begin to dislike all MPs, therefore, it could be considered as a violation of privileges of the other MPs,” he said. Therefore, I request the Speaker to appoint a Special Parliament Select Committee to probe the statement in question and to provide recommendations on the matter. The Justice Minister said, members and the chairpersons of the select committee should be appointed by the Speaker and the number of members should not exceed 21 as per Standing Order 101. The select committee should have the power to decide the quorum. It should also have the power to summon persons according to its opinions to obtain written and oral testimonies. The select committee should have the power to obtain service of the experts on the subject and it should have the power to present reports and continue the meetings despite prorogation or adjournment of the House, he added."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Siridhamma Thera was found to be in poor health, and on 25 October, his condition was so serious that he had to be hospitalised,” HRCSL said. They added that under Section 9(l) of the PTA, where the Minister has reason to believe or suspect that any person is connected with or concerned in any unlawful activity, the Minister may order that such person be detained for a period not exceeding three months in the first instance, in such place and subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Minister. Any such order may be extended from time to time for a period not exceeding three months at a time, provided that the aggregate period of detention does not exceed twelve months. The HRCSL deems the investigations conducted into the “unlawful activity” purported to have been done by these detainees under the PTA to be unreasonable, unfair, vexatious, and wholly without justification, and asserts that the detainees in question can be prosecuted under general law. The HRCSL said, the detainees informed the Director and Deputy Director of the HRCSL who visited them that they have only been interrogated on a few occasions during the period of detention regarding their involvement in the recent civil unrest in the country. While stating that the HRCSL is yet to receive a progress report of the status of the investigation from the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID), they said, the treatment and harassment of the said detainees are made all the more unacceptable by the fact that it is a deterrent to the public at large to exercise their freedom of expression and peaceful assembly enshrined in the Constitution.

Any such order may be extended from time to time for a period not exceeding three months at a time, provided that the aggregate period of detention does not exceed twelve months. The HRCSL deems the investigations conducted into the “unlawful activity” purported to have been done by these detainees under the PTA to be unreasonable, unfair, vexatious, and wholly without justification, and asserts that the detainees in question can be prosecuted under general law. The HRCSL said, the detainees informed the Director and Deputy Director of the HRCSL who visited them that they have only been interrogated on a few occasions during the period of detention regarding their involvement in the recent civil unrest in the country. While stating that the HRCSL is yet to receive a progress report of the status of the investigation from the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID), they said, the treatment and harassment of the said detainees are made all the more unacceptable by the fact that it is a deterrent to the public at large to exercise their freedom of expression and peaceful assembly enshrined in the Constitution.

AIPPOA President, Chandika Gankanda when contacted yesterday (26) said the 1,200 generics had some 7,500 brand names times and switch to a different brand of the same generic depending on the benefit he or she receives for promoting it. It had resulted in pharmacies being overstocked with medicinal drugs worth millions of rupees that had passed their shelf life. Since 2015, the AIPPOA has asked for an “Expire Policy” to be introduced, so that pharmacies would be able to collect all drug stocks that were outdated and return it either to the agent of the pharma company to be returned to that particular drug manufacturer or the local manufacturer of the particular drug. Gankanda observed that the country could save dollars by controlling the number of drug brands of a single generic being imported. “With the inability to dispose of these drugs which have passed their shelf life to the environment, and the irregularity of the pharmacies being able to hand  over the expired drugs to the cement factory which incinerates those stocks, the only option is to allow them to accumulate.” These medicines are worth millions and end up being monetary wastage, which the country cannot afford at this juncture, the AIPPOA Chairman said.

A shared vision is a solid base for a teacher education curriculum, the document added. Such a policy should cover the continuous professional development (CPD) of pre-service and in-service teachers as well as their recruitment, deployment and retention, the report recommended.  There is also a need to eradicate gender disparities in recruitment, deployment and retention, ADB further said. ADB therefore recommended to “develop and implement of a national policy on professional development;”  “establish a professional council to support teacher development and introduce a national competency framework;” “utilise profiles in teacher licensing-” that would help ensure the quality of teachers’ performance, and their participation in CPD at different levels; “expand the use of ICT and online technology for teacher education,” “strengthen teacher education through school-based teacher development-”teachers can improve the quality of education through research, assignments, and other creative efforts to support “authentic” learning and “establish a systematic, countrywide mentoring network to support teacher education-”A mentoring network would make an important contribution to all these areas of teacher development, the ADB said.

He said unless an MP voluntarily declares their dual citizenship, there is no way to know the truth about the matter. In light of passing 22nd Amendment to the Constitution that prohibits dual citizens of the right to hold political office, he said, there are reports about 10 MPs who hold dual citizenship and they should resign immediately. “We should find out who those ten MPs are. When dual citizens were barred from becoming MPs in 2015, a billionaire in Sri Lanka approached me with a request. He told me there are 10 Tamil MPs who are dual citizens of Norway and Canada while a minister from the SLFP was a Swiss citizen. He said he will spend any amount of money to remove them from Parliament,” he said. No country was willing to provide him with information on dual citizen MPs, Gammanpila said. He said when one obtains citizenship of another country, one’s Sri Lankan citizenship is renounced. He added that if you do not inform the Government that you have become a citizen of another country, they or anyone else have no way of finding out. “It is said there are more than 10 dual citizens in Parliament now. But there is no way of finding out. Except for four members, the present Parliament was formed prior to the passage of the 22nd Amendment. That is why the so-called dual citizens have cheated their way into Parliament by hiding their dual citizenship. Thus, another method to identify dual citizens should be developed,” he said.

Wickremeratne said, this has been done with an eye to ensuring that there are proper safeguards, therefore, it does not provide for completely unfettered public access to asset declarations, but instead the Bill ensures that the proper privacy of the declarations are protected, in line with international norms on asset declaration transparency. “Second, the Bill ensures that electoral candidates will submit asset declaration’s with the nomination. It is a response to the current political concerns from society, and the call of the ‘Aragalaya’, that public representatives and officials provide proper disclosure of their wealth to increase transparency. Third, the Bill has included the president in the list of individuals to whom this law applies,” he added. Wickremeratne added that fourth, the Bill ensures that asset declarations are routinely examined and verified at a central authority- the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). “This has never been done before, as asset declarations were only called for when there had been a complaint filed. The Bill has also introduced an online portal through which CIABOC can monitor and verify asset declarations to streamline the process. These amendments to the Act mean that officials cannot secretly amass large amount of wealth after coming into public office. Large increase in wealth will be subjected to proper explanation, as it should be,” he added. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

There is no price control mechanism for bread, and the bakery owners set their own selling price. These types of raids do not bring any solutions to the industry,” he said. Further, he said raided bakeries will continue to use the same method to pay their fines, otherwise there will be no way to sell bakery products due to the high cost of ingredients, including wheat flour.

Making a speech outside his Downing Street office, Sunak said he was not daunted by the scale of the challenge as he became Britain’s third Prime Minister in two months, pledging to lead the country through an economic crisis and rebuild trust in politics. The 42-year-old former hedge fund boss, who has only been in elected politics for seven years, has been tasked with bringing an end to the political infighting and radical changes in policy that have horrified investors and alarmed international allies. He warned that difficult decisions lay ahead as he looks to cut public spending and fix the “mistakes” that were made by Liz Truss during her short and chaotic tenure in Downing Street, just as the country slides into a recession. “I fully appreciate how hard things are,” he said outside the Prime Minister’s residence at Downing Street where he shunned the normal tradition of standing beside his family and cheering political supporters. “I understand too that I have work to do to restore trust, after all that has happened. All I can say is that I am not daunted. I know the high office I have accepted and I hope to live up to its demands.” Sunak, one of the richest men in parliament, is expected to slash spending to plug an estimated 40 billion pound ($45 billion) hole in the public finances created by an economic slowdown, higher borrowing costs and an energy support scheme. With his party’s popularity in freefall, he will face growing calls for an election if he ditches too many of the promises that helped elect the Conservative Party in 2019, when then leader Boris Johnson pledged to invest heavily. Economists and investors have welcomed Sunak’s appointment – Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary said, the adults had taken charge again – but they warn he has few options to fix the country’s finances when millions are battling a cost of living crunch. Sunak, who ran the Treasury during the COVID-19 pandemic, promised to put economic stability and confidence at the heart of the agenda. “This will mean difficult decisions to come,” he said, shortly after he accepted King Charles’s request to form a government. Sunak also vowed to put the public’s need above politics, in recognition of the growing anger at Britain’s political class and the ideological battles that have raged ever since the historic 2016 vote to leave the European Union.

According to AHP President, Ravi Kumudesh, those tests include Bence-Jones Protein test (used to check on multiple myeloma, a type of cancer), ANA test (test to detect antinuclear antibodies), Varcella IgG PCR, EBV PCR, BKV PCR, Pavo IgM PCR, Hepatitis A IgM, Hepatitis C Ab, Hepatitis B Antibody Profile, Hepatitis Anitigen and Hepatitis Co Antigen. In addition, there was a shortage of Vitamin B12, 8. Projesterone, Vitamin D, Cortizole (steroid hormone for your adrenal glands, the endocrine glands), and Cyclosphorine (to prevent organ rejection). However, interested parties were making use of the situation in the health service to obtain large-scale benefits by diverting medical testing and purchasing of medicinal drugs to the private sector. The Health Ministry does not attempt to prevent the situation and provide proper guidance. Several of its officials have become pawns of this system, he alleged. The AHP President said while it was possible to obtain funds from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), World Bank, and the Indian Credit Line to support the purchase of essential medicines and laboratory reagents for the State health service, China had provided aid separately. But unfortunately, the health officials had failed to use any of this aid effectively or efficiently leading to this health crisis, he said. Furthermore, Kumudesh accused that service extension has been granted for ten top administrative officers of the Health Ministry who work for their personal gain by another year, ignoring the advice of several sections of health professionals’ unions.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

AITWDU Chairman, Lalith Dharmasekara, earlier said they will reduce three-wheeler fares if the weekly fuel quota was increased to 20 litres. “If a different faction claims to have reduced three-wheeler fares, the rate at which it was reduced should be declared. Making a media statement that fares have been reduced is a publicity stunt. The increased fuel quota for three-wheeler tariff revision is insufficient, and it should be increased by at least 10 litres,” he said. Dharmasekara said, three-wheeler drivers presently charge Rs 100 for the first kilometre and Rs 120 for each additional kilometre. President Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed to increase the weekly fuel quota of 5 litres issued for passenger transport three-wheelers to 10 litres. As the first phase, the registration of passenger transport three-wheelers in the Western Province is scheduled to commence on 1 November. This was said during the discussion held between the President’s Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Staff to the President Sagala Ratnayake and three-wheeler drivers’ associations. Accordingly, from 6 November, 10 litres of fuel will be issued per week to all passenger transport three-wheelers in the Western Province. The registration of passenger transport three-wheelers will take place from 6 to 13 November, after which it is planned to issue the fuel quota to three-wheelers in other provinces. (TR)"

It is the duty of the senior monk to take care of the novice monk like a parent, he added. “There were immoral monks who engaged in wicked acts even during Lord Buddha’s time. That is why a code of conduct was introduced for monks. Even today, there are immoral monks, but there is no mechanism to monitor them.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals.

Accordingly, the COPE recommended that a report be given within six weeks, based on the action taken in this connection. These recommendations were made when the COPE met in Parliament last week, under the chairmanship of Prof. Ranjith Bandara, to examine the Auditor General’s report for the year 2020 and the current performance of the Land Reform Commission. The COPE gave several recommendations to the commission and it was decided that the Land Reform Commission be summoned before the COPE again within three months to look into the implementation of those recommendations. The COPE observed the concerns in the transfer of land by the commission and thus the COPE Chairman recommended that a report containing detailed information about the transfer of land in the last 20 years should be submitted to the COPE within a month. The COPE also recommended setting up a task force to identify and estimate the value of land and recommended that the Secretary to the Ministry report to the COPE, within two weeks, the details of the responsibilities assigned to the task force. The COPE recommended the appointment of the Surveyor General or his representative as well as the Government Assessor or his representative to this task force. Furthermore, the COPE discussed the 2018 project to distribute 10,000 plots of land and Prof. Ranjith Bandara recommended that a detailed report on its progress be given to the committee. In particular, he recommended that the position of the 214 people recruited, on a temporary basis for this project, should be discussed with the management department and a definite final decision should be taken to include them in the approved number of employees and if necessary, they should be referred to the Cabinet for approval. Furthermore, the COPE recommended including the procedure of the Land Reform Commission in a national policy on land distribution and making necessary arrangements. The committee instructed updating the 50-year-old Land Reforms Commission Act to suit the present-day context. The missing files of the Land Reforms Commission were also taken into discussion and the COPE informed the commission to immediately submit them to the Auditor General. The COPE Committee also recommended that immediate action should be taken to resolve the existing issues regarding the beneficiaries identified earlier under the statutory assignments. The Auditor General’s opinion on the financial statements of this commission has been disclaimed for about 10 years, the notice was given to prepare the financial statements correctly and arrange for the annual reports to be tabled in the Parliament within three months. The committee recommended taking action against the alleged company to recover the amount of 17 million rupees paid to a private computer company for the creation and development of a fully integrated computer system and to take disciplinary action against the officials involved in the matter. Furthermore, it was also recommended taking legal action within two weeks to recover the amount of nearly 12 million rupees for the six acres of land assigned to a private company without a tax deed in Homagama. It was also instructed to inquire and report to the COPE committee regarding not making an agreement and charging 4% instead of 6% of the assessed value."

Amarasinghe claimed that a chalet built in the Knuckles range was outside the buffer zone and he had the authorisation to build the chalet. The land in Pitawela, Atangwella, Ilukumbura, which he had bought 12 years ago was transferred by deed to his son in 2021, he said. Amarasinghe claimed the chalet will be made entirely of iron rods. He declared that because it was outside the safe zone, he would write to the President and other people to say that he was ‘not guilty’. He added, he had obtained permission from the National Building Research Organisation and from the Pradeshiya Sabha and not necessarily from the CEA. He said, he is waiting for approval from the Agrarian Services Committee to build the road to the chalet. Meanwhile, SLPP MP Wasantha Yapabandara said, there were numerous petitions relating to his two constructions in Kandy that require investigations. The MP told Ceylon Today that the government should verify if it is in the buffer zone or not, but he also stated that they had received petitions over two of the structures, namely in the Knuckles range and in Hantane, Kandy as well, as both were owned by the former CEA Chairman. The former Chairman of the CEA is accused of encroaching on the forest range, according to MP Yapabandara, who brought up the issue in the Parliament last week. He claimed that in addition to conflicts of interest, a number of other purportedly “approved” constructions are also allegedly being built in river beds with the approval of the CEA in various other places. However, the MP stated that the chalet is built on elevated man-made land and the road runs across a paddy field, for which he did not acquire authorisation from the Agrarian Services Committee. The MP wondered how Amarsinghe could build a chalet without such prior approval. Also, the SLPP MP stated that a construction project in Hantane owned by the former CEA chairman is in the process, but he has not received prior consent from the Hantana Protect Committee, and legal action has been already filed over this.  “There are several petitions against those two constructions and we want him to justify whether it is illegal or not, but we have the petitions,” the MP noted. The politician also alleged that there are constructions of hotels in the middle of the river, on the sandy mounds, which are visible to any, but the CEA has issued permission. “but how can that be” is a common question people ask. He pointed out there is one such hotel built in Hakinda, Gatambe and another resort named Escape in Gannoruwa river. The MP noted that environmental destruction is on the rise and the government should identify each of them and verify the legality of constructing such resorts in Sri Lanka.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Sunak’s win came days after Truss’ resignation following her disastrous tax cuts plans and policy U-turns plunged the markets into chaos. The unprecedented economic crisis drew a rare intervention from the Bank of England. Sunak’s only challenger, Penny Mordaunt, leader of the House of Commons and former defence minister, was reportedly backed by 30 MPs compared with nearly 150 supporting Sunak. “This decision is an historic one and shows, once again, the diversity and talent of our party,” Mordaunt said in a statement as she withdrew from the race just minutes before the winner was due to be announced. “Rishi has my full support.” “These are unprecedented times. Despite the compressed timetable for the leadership contest it is clear that colleagues feel we need certainty today,” she said. “They have taken this decision in good faith for the good of the country.” Sunak and Mordaunt had lost to Truss in an earlier race to appoint a new leader after then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson was forced to announce his resignation in July following a wave of scandals linked to parties entertained during the coronavirus lockdown. Sunak, a former finance minister, will be Britain’s first leader of colour and the first Hindu to take the top job. At 42, he’ll also be the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. The multi-millionaire former hedge fund boss will be expected to launch deep spending cuts to try to rebuild Britain’s fiscal reputation, just as the country slides into a recession, dragged down by the surging cost of energy and food. He will also inherit a political party that has fractured along ideological lines, a challenge that damaged the fortunes of several former Conservative leaders. (AL Jazeera)"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/10/25/participation-of-youth-needed-to-develop-country-president/,Participation of youth needed to develop country – President,Author not found,0,2022-10-24T20:30:00+00:00,"President Ranil Wickremesinghe said he aims to make Sri Lanka a developed country by 2048 and that the participation of the youth should be ensured to achieve this goal. The President made this statement during a discussion held on 22 October via Zoom with the youth of the ‘2048 Youth Platform on the Journey towards a Developed State’ programme. The youth were given an opportunity to question the President about the social, economic and political issues of the country as well as the problems faced by today’s youth. “First, we are working towards creating a situation where our country can move forward. When I took over the country, the country’s economy had completely collapsed. If we are unable to recover from this predicament, we will have no future. During the agitations in the country recently, I took over this government and initiated measures to resurrect the bankrupt economy. The youth of the country have the opportunity to take part in it. One of the steps that I have proposed is to appoint five young people to every parliamentary oversight committee. The selection of members and chairpersons of the oversight committees has not been completed yet,” he said. Speaking further, he also said that similarly, they intend to legalise the youth parliament. He said there is an opportunity for new youth to come forward through the proposed Jana Sabha. “In addition, we have invited the groups that joined the struggle but did not resort to violence, to participate in this process. I hope this move will produce the new leadership we need. I would like to assure you that we are now paving the way for it. “Entrepreneurs began to emerge following the open economy in 1977. While these measures were initiated during the British era, entrepreneurs emerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries. However, after 1960, the number of entrepreneurs decreased because of the government’s tight economic control. In 1977, we were in a very competitive economic environment in Asia. However, today our economy is not competitive. From 1977 to date, we have not been able to join this programme. A good example is the oil tank farm in Trincomalee. For 15-20 years, these tanks were not utilised. If not for LIOC, we would not even have this concession. Many businesses in the country have gone bankrupt today. Our banking system has been safeguarded with the greatest difficulty. Our priority should be to strengthen our banking system. We should also make our economy competitive. The export economy should be strengthened. Young entrepreneurs can take over these bankrupt businesses and uplift them,” he said. Speaking further he also noted that they need to look at how loans could be provided to young entrepreneurs. “We have already started a programme on food security. In addition, the programme of providing fertiliser for agriculture has also been implemented. We have received the dollars required to purchase fertiliser. As we have received money from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other countries, we can now purchase fertiliser. The fertiliser needed for the Maha season is currently available in the country. It will be distributed shortly. If there are any shortcomings, I have advised the authorities to look into them. We have also taken steps to provide the required fuel for agricultural purposes. We also expect to receive the second batch of fertiliser after the 15 November. We plan to commence food production completely within the first three to four months of next year. Currently, there is no problem with paddy production. However, maize cultivation needs to be expanded,” he said. The President also said agriculture has to be modernised and there are agrarian service centres and several officers are working at the village level but they have not been deployed to duties systematically. When agriculture is modernised, there will be a lot of work to be done, he added. “The high rate of brain drain commenced last year. It has increased rapidly this year with the economic crisis. Uncertainty about the future is the cause of this. I would like to raise two matters in this regard. The first issue is if it is fair to leave the country having received free education to get a good job. This situation will last until the middle of next year. Government revenue has dropped to 8.5 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, which should be raised to 14 per cent. The non-taxation in the past is the root cause of this issue. Now, we have got to move forward with the new tax systems,” he said."

He said Cabinet approval was granted for the Cabinet Paper submitted by him for the amendment of the relevant laws pertaining to the exportation of timber and timber-related products. He noted that the importation of wooden furniture, which was restricted with the economic crisis, will not be relaxed over the next few years, adding that the local demand for furniture is currently met through the State Timber Corporation (STC). ‘’Due to the increase in the demand of wooden furniture, STC earned a profit of Rs 3,735 million by the end of September 2022,’’ he said. While stating that STC currently has more than 500 MT of ebony wood in stock, Amaraweera instructed to take steps to prepare furniture for the export market by using the stocks of ebony wood in a mixture noting that the Government seeks to make the STC a foreign exchange earning institution. Amaraweera also advised to take steps to increase the income of the STC by an additional Rs 250 million by the end of this year. BY Faadhila Thassim"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Before proceeding with the process of releasing these prisoners, President’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake had sought the approval of former President Kumaratunga on the advice of the President. The relevant arrangements were made after obtaining her consent. The President granted this amnesty according to Article 34 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. As a result of several discussions between Tamil MPs and the President on several occasions, steps were taken to release these prisoners. Before their release, a preliminary investigation had been conducted on them with the intervention of the Ministry of Defence on the instructions of the President. This decision has been reached after consulting the Minister of Justice and through him the Attorney General about the consent report. Three of the Tamil prisoners, who were pardoned, were those accused of attempting to assassinate former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. Accordingly, the four detainees with connections to the LTTE organisation, who were detained at the Colombo Magazine Prison, were released after their sentence was reduced. Two Tamil LTTE prisoners related to the organisation are to be released after the cases filed by them in the Court of Appeal are withdrawn and two more Tamil prisoners are to be released soon under the presidential amnesty. Three prisoners had been sentenced to 30 years in jail and had served 22 years, one prisoner who had been sentenced to 11 years and had served 14 years, one who has been sentenced to 10 years and had also served 14 years, two prisoners who were sentenced to five years but had served for14 years, were among those who received a presidential pardon.

Chandana Jayaratne, Professor of Physics, and Director of the Astronomy and Space Science Unit at the University of Colombo said in a statement that for the city of Jaffna, the partial eclipse begins at 5.27 p.m. and the maximum eclipse occurs at 5.46 p.m. with 8.8 % of the solar disk covered by the moon. Though the eclipse ends at 6.20 p.m. it can be observed only up to sunset due at 5.49 p.m. This eclipse will be visible in Jaffna for 22 minutes. The Northern part of Sri Lanka, from Anuradhapura to Jaffna, is the most suitable region to observe this eclipse, while this eclipse is not visible to the southern parts of Sri Lanka, he noted. For Colombo the beginning of the partial eclipse can be observed at 5.43 p.m. and the maximum eclipse at 5.49 p.m. with the moon covering about 1.6% of the solar disk. However, he added partial solar eclipse cannot be observed after 5.52 p.m. due to sunset. This eclipse will be visible to the Colombo area for about 9 minutes, Prof. Jayaratne said. Since this eclipse occurs when the sun is very dim near the western horizon close to sunset, it is fairly okay to observe the eclipse even without a solar filter.  He added that naked eye observations at the eclipse maximum time and afterward for a short period of fewer than 30 seconds will not cause any damage to the eyes."

Amarasinghe claimed that a chalet built in the Knuckles range was outside the buffer zone and he had the authorisation to build the chalet. The land in Pitawela, Atangwella, Ilukumbura, which he had bought 12 years ago was transferred by deed to his son in 2021, he said. Amarasinghe claimed the chalet will be made entirely of iron rods. He declared that because it was outside the safe zone, he would write to the President and other people to say that he was ‘not guilty’. He added, he had obtained permission from the National Building Research Organisation and from the Pradeshiya Sabha and not necessarily from the CEA. He said, he is waiting for approval from the Agrarian Services Committee to build the road to the chalet. Meanwhile, SLPP MP Wasantha Yapabandara said, there were numerous petitions relating to his two constructions in Kandy that require investigations. The MP told Ceylon Today that the government should verify if it is in the buffer zone or not, but he also stated that they had received petitions over two of the structures, namely in the Knuckles range and in Hantane, Kandy as well, as both were owned by the former CEA Chairman. The former Chairman of the CEA is accused of encroaching on the forest range, according to MP Yapabandara, who brought up the issue in the Parliament last week. He claimed that in addition to conflicts of interest, a number of other purportedly “approved” constructions are also allegedly being built in river beds with the approval of the CEA in various other places. However, the MP stated that the chalet is built on elevated man-made land and the road runs across a paddy field, for which he did not acquire authorisation from the Agrarian Services Committee. The MP wondered how Amarsinghe could build a chalet without such prior approval. Also, the SLPP MP stated that a construction project in Hantane owned by the former CEA chairman is in the process, but he has not received prior consent from the Hantana Protect Committee, and legal action has been already filed over this.  “There are several petitions against those two constructions and we want him to justify whether it is illegal or not, but we have the petitions,” the MP noted. The politician also alleged that there are constructions of hotels in the middle of the river, on the sandy mounds, which are visible to any, but the CEA has issued permission. “but how can that be” is a common question people ask. He pointed out there is one such hotel built in Hakinda, Gatambe and another resort named Escape in Gannoruwa river. The MP noted that environmental destruction is on the rise and the government should identify each of them and verify the legality of constructing such resorts in Sri Lanka.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Despite the compressed timetable for the leadership contest it is clear that colleagues feel we need certainty today,” she said. “They have taken this decision in good faith for the good of the country.” Sunak and Mordaunt had lost to Truss in an earlier race to appoint a new leader after then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson was forced to announce his resignation in July following a wave of scandals linked to parties entertained during the coronavirus lockdown. Sunak, a former finance minister, will be Britain’s first leader of colour and the first Hindu to take the top job. At 42, he’ll also be the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. The multi-millionaire former hedge fund boss will be expected to launch deep spending cuts to try to rebuild Britain’s fiscal reputation, just as the country slides into a recession, dragged down by the surging cost of energy and food. He will also inherit a political party that has fractured along ideological lines, a challenge that damaged the fortunes of several former Conservative leaders. (AL Jazeera)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He said this during a sermon of the Katina Maha Punyotsavaya of the Sedawatta, Veragoda Purana Viharaya, which was held under the patronage of President Wickremesinghe.  He also said the President is a philanthropic democratic leader and that this action to relinquish the dictatorial powers of the presidency to Parliament will lead to the development of the country. This annual Katina Pinkama was organised on the directives of Ven. Ambanwela Gnanaloka Thera, the Chief Incumbent of the Temple. The Katina Cheevaraya was brought to the Presidential Secretariat in a procession for staff members to pay their respects. President Wickremesinghe took part in the Katina Cheevara Pooja and offered alms to the monks. “Today, President Ranil Wickremesinghe is respected globally as a benevolent democratic leader. Today, the whole world is watching us. It is a very important process at a time when the President is preparing to start a new era in this country, by transferring his powers to Parliament in a democratic framework and having the 22nd Amendment passed with a two-thirds majority. It is very important because all the democratic institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are watching us today. By February and March of 2022, the future of this country was looking bleak. The people were in a dilemma. At that challenging time, our President rose to the occasion and accepted it with the will and the blessings of the ruling party and the Opposition,” Ven. Akuratiye Nanda Thera further said. Ven. Nanda Thera added that the country was facing food shortages and food production was reduced due to lack of fertiliser. He said there were fuel queues and gas queues. “However, President Wickremesinghe took on all these challenges and won and today the people have been given some relief. Further, due to the constitutional amendment passed with a majority in Parliament, it has ensured a democratic society and by empowering the parliamentary committees, it has paved the way to render great service to the nation. Today, a number of organisations including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have promised the President to support Sri Lanka in overcoming these challenges,” he said."

Premadasa made the remarks while attending the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo Central Constituency Board meeting on 22 October. It was hosted by MP Mujibar Rahman. Premadasa said in order to save the country from the current crisis, the people are demanding a change in the system, not giving personal bounties based on their own will and that under the new system, a programme that prioritises economic, social, and human rights is required. “The sons and daughters of politicians in this country have always accepted the seats of their parents and although the Central Colombo seat is unique, in my political journey I went to a difficult province and learned about the people of that province and started my political journey spontaneously because I needed to prove something to the country and the people,” he added. He further said that the reason for the tragic fate of the country today is the result of the Rajapaksa’s division of race, religion, caste and class and breaking the country into pieces and creating hatred between races and religions. “This caste-religious discrimination was implemented starting from sterilisation and sterilisation operations and ending with cremation and burial. Today, even though various parties are shouting racism and bigotry, then everyone except the United People’s Force did not oppose it,” he added. Premadasa further claimed that with the 22nd Amendment, “Mola hatha” aka Basil Rajapaksa had lost his mind because he is going to run for the election again. He challenged him to contest from the Colombo District and said that Rajapaksa will be removed from the power step by step. BY Nabiya Vaffoor"

Today, the situation is gradually improving as a result of the President’s timely action, he said. Abeywardena was speaking at the 10th Anniversary of the Hansini Pitakum Karate Tournament, which was held at Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium. “Still, there are certain issues to be resolved. The President has taken necessary action to resolve them as soon as possible. Parents must act prudently to ensure a better tomorrow for their children. If people set aside their party differences, Sri Lanka can reach new heights,” Abeywardena said. “The youth staged anti-government protests. The Aragalaya should not lead to devastation.

The President made this observation during a meeting with the Prefects of Royal College, Colombo held at the Presidential Secretariat on 22 October. The matters concerning Royal College as well as matters regarding the country’s education sector were discussed there, while the President answered the questions raised by the students on the measures taken by the government for the advancement of the education sector. The President made queries from the prefects on the university education, where the students brought the attention of the President to the vast difference between the duration to complete a degree in a foreign higher education institute and in a local university. The President agreed and assured that remedial action would be taken without delay. He also highlighted the value of education in a local university over foreign education. He also emphasised that the government has taken many steps to expand the educational opportunities for students who have qualified for higher education, following the completion of their school education. He added that measures have been taken to commence several new universities in Kurunegala and Batticaloa.  President Wickremesinghe raised the issue of ragging with the students during the meeting and said that it seemed that students who attend the universities from schools such as Royal College, Thurstan College, Ananda College and D.S. Senanayake College turn a blind eye when such ragging incidents happen, although a large number of students from these schools are within these universities. The President also pointed out that the students of those universities have a responsibility to bring ragging in universities to an end and the head prefects of those schools could perform that role while in school. He further said that university education is interesting but the rate of students suffering from physical and mental stress has increased due to ragging at universities and emphasized that he would take measures to solve the problem. He also appreciated the role played by the Board of Prefects of the Royal College in the development of the school and its reputation.

In the 19th Amendment bill they permitted various changes, and said that this doesn’t require a referendum but now the same Supreme Court says you require a referendum. It’s not only the Parliament that swings like a pendulum, it’s the Supreme Court also. Change that Supreme Court also. Ask them also to go home. If they can’t read and understand their own determination in the 19th Amendment, you are showing the country something when it is not, and that is potentially harmful because the confidence people have in these institutions have eroded and have been totally destroyed. When they find Parliament has also misled us, it leads us to think that some major reform has to take place. When there is no reform, they will only take to the streets.” MP Sumanthiran also pointed out that many MPs have voted in favour of all 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 22nd Amendments, which contradict each other.  “Many members of this House voted for the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. The same members voted for the 18th Amendment. Those very members voted for the 19th Amendment and for the 20th Amendment. And today, they are all ready to vote for the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. They are like a pendulum. They swing from one end to the other. “What type of Parliament is this? No wonder that the country says to be done with these 225. Why is this 22nd Amendment coming today? It is coming because people in the country want a system change, not tinkering with the Constitution. Some tinkering happened from the 17th onwards, but this bill before this House today doesn’t even tinker with the Constitution. If it’s passed it will still retain all the powers of the executive presidency, which is an absolute fraud. In 1994, the presidential election manifesto said the executive presidency would be abolished within six months. Six months has still not come. “Every other candidate at every other presidential election comes to the people and says ‘I will abolish the executive presidency’. You are lying to the people saying this is the first step towards that and in fact none of the powers of executive president was taken away by this Bill. It is a big lie and a hoax to say that the executive branch will be abolished and we will pass this before that.” (NV)"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

In the 19th Amendment bill they permitted various changes, and said that this doesn’t require a referendum but now the same Supreme Court says you require a referendum. It’s not only the Parliament that swings like a pendulum, it’s the Supreme Court also. Change that Supreme Court also. Ask them also to go home. If they can’t read and understand their own determination in the 19th Amendment, you are showing the country something when it is not, and that is potentially harmful because the confidence people have in these institutions have eroded and have been totally destroyed. When they find Parliament has also misled us, it leads us to think that some major reform has to take place. When there is no reform, they will only take to the streets.” MP Sumanthiran also pointed out that many MPs have voted in favour of all 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 22nd Amendments, which contradict each other.  “Many members of this House voted for the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. The same members voted for the 18th Amendment. Those very members voted for the 19th Amendment and for the 20th Amendment. And today, they are all ready to vote for the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. They are like a pendulum. They swing from one end to the other. “What type of Parliament is this? No wonder that the country says to be done with these 225. Why is this 22nd Amendment coming today? It is coming because people in the country want a system change, not tinkering with the Constitution. Some tinkering happened from the 17th onwards, but this bill before this House today doesn’t even tinker with the Constitution. If it’s passed it will still retain all the powers of the executive presidency, which is an absolute fraud. In 1994, the presidential election manifesto said the executive presidency would be abolished within six months. Six months has still not come. “Every other candidate at every other presidential election comes to the people and says ‘I will abolish the executive presidency’. You are lying to the people saying this is the first step towards that and in fact none of the powers of executive president was taken away by this Bill. It is a big lie and a hoax to say that the executive branch will be abolished and we will pass this before that.” (NV)"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/10/24/xi-jinping-secures-third-term-in-power/,Xi Jinping secures third term in power,Author not found,0,2022-10-23T20:30:00+00:00,"China wrapped up its twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle on Sunday (23), with Xi Jinping securing a third term as general secretary of the ruling Communist Party and packing the new Politburo Standing Committee with allies. The precedent-breaking third term for Xi secures his place as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, founder of the People’s Republic of China. Here are key takeaways from the 20th party congress: The new seven-man Politburo Standing Committee is made up entirely of Xi loyalists, including Shanghai party chief Li Qiang, who is on track to replace Li Keqiang as premier in March. Breaking with a tradition of factional checks and balances stretching back to Mao’s death in 1976, Xi installed a leadership configuration of loyalists at the extreme end of predictions. Some analysts had expected – or hoped for – the inclusion of a token member not allied with Xi. Three of the four new Standing Committee members owe their political rise to Xi, and the fourth is believed to be closely aligned with him. All but Guangdong party chief Li Xi worked under Xi in the 2000s, either in affluent Zhejiang province or in Shanghai. They were promoted during or after their time with Xi, a clear sign that they had earned his trust and benefited from his patronage. “It’s truly remarkable in the sense that it’s almost like a break from the past 40 plus years. Xi is the Chinese leader who really got to pick his own team,” said Dali Yang, professor of political science at the University of Chicago. “We see victory of (the) ‘Zhejiang army’ – persons close to Xi Jinping who shared career paths with him in that province – and the elimination of what little may have remained of other factions,” said Bates Gill, executive director of the Centre for China Analysis at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York. Having packed his leadership team with allies, and with the party constitution amended to enshrine Xi’s authority and ideas as its “core”, Xi has an entirely free hand to make and implement policy, for better or worse. That means that if things backfire, it is harder to shift blame, analysts say. It also risks creating an echo chamber of group-think, where alternative voices aren’t heard and critical feedback is withheld. Yang Zhang, assistant professor in the School of International Service at American University, said Xi’s “autocracy may provoke stronger international pushback from the U.S.-led Western countries. All of these scenarios will make his third and likely fourth terms not as easy as expected.” Xi opened the congress with a speech indicating continuity in policy direction even as he rebranded his vision for the path ahead as “Chinese-style modernisation” and emphasised security in an increasingly dangerous world. Ja Ian Chong, a political scientist at National University Of Singapore, said the outcome of the party congress likely means more Chinese assertiveness in foreign policy and security. “So, probably more direct party-state direction of the economy,” Chong said. Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX Strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore, predicted Xi’s harsh zero-COVID eradication strategy would like become “more entrenched”. Xi’s appointment to a third term was not his only breaking of the norms that long guided China’s elite politics. By excluding Li Keqiang and Wang Yang, both 67, from the party Central Committee and Standing Committee, Xi broke with the “seven-up/eight-down” rule that those aged 67 or under would remain for another five years. He also without explanation shrank the Politburo to 24 from 25 people – the odd number meant that there could be a tie-breaker on close votes. “With Xi practising ‘one-man-politics’, there’s no longer any need for a tie-breaker, everyone will vote according to what Xi wants,” said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the National University of Singapore. There is also no woman on the Politburo for the first time in 20 years. No woman has ever made it onto the Standing Committee. When Xi joined the Standing Committee in 2007, it was clear from his age and from the makeup of the committee that he was on track to replace Hu Jintao, who held China’s top post of party general secretary, once Hu’s second term ended in 2012. There has been no heir-apparent since Xi assumed power, and he kept it that way on Sunday. None of the Standing Committee newcomers are young enough to take over in 2027 and serve two terms after that under the norms of Chinese politics. The youngest is Ding Xuexiang, who is 60. The absence of a clear successor indicates that Xi may want to remain beyond three terms, increasing policy risk and unpredictability the longer he is in power, analysts say. The lack of a successor creates key-man risk – Xi is 69 – and undermines the orderly leadership transition norms that were put in place after the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution to avoid a repeat of Mao’s struggles to hold power indefinitely.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

It was a US company that has hired the SSC to move out the piled up wreck from the sea which will be conducted using advanced technology and experienced divers.  The Chinese salvage was hired to remove wreckage from the sea and to move it out of the country. The two vessels arrived yesterday for the purpose, noted Sri Lanka Ports Authority Habour Master, Captain Nimal P. Silva. According to him, the salvage is expected to be completed before the next South West monsoon.     Shanghai Salvage Company (SCC) has been signed to remove the burned-out wreck of the X-Press Pearl last year. The Xpress Pearl caught fire in May 2021 off the coast of Sri Lanka, and the blaze spread through the vessel which eventually sank in shallow water. The ship now sits on the seabed with its superstructure visible above the waterline. The SCC has established a salvage team and has started to assemble the necessary equipment for the work, said vessel-owner X-Press Feeders, adding the plan was to make sure the removal is conducted safely, with no further pollution from the vessel. “The wreck removal team will be supported by response tugs on a 24-hour watch to deal with debris or forms of pollutants. Regular water sampling will be ongoing, with representatives of ITOPF and Oil Spill Response ready to respond immediately, if required,” said the company. When the ship went down, it spewed tons of plastic nurdles (raw plastic pellets), and drifts of the difficult-to-remove material washed up on beaches throughout the island’s west coast. Minister  Ali Sabry confirmed around 650 tonnes of pellets had been removed from Sri Lanka’s beaches thanks to 3,500 man-days of labour, when the coastal clean-up took place last year.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/10/20/taxation-vital-to-get-imf-assistance-president/,Taxation Vital to Get IMF Assistance – President,Author not found,0,2022-10-19T20:50:00+00:00,"Without implementing a new income tax scheme, Sri Lanka cannot get the assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Sri Lankans will have to go back to the days where they were forced to stand in long queues to get essential goods, President Ranil Wickremesinghe warned yesterday (19). Addressing the nation last evening, Wickremesinghe elaborated that the tax scheme was introduced to achieve 14.5% – 15% gross domestic product (GDP) revenue by 2026.  “The Treasury and the IMF discussed the possibility of limiting taxation from those who have an income of Rs 200,000, but that was not possible. Eventually, income tax was levied on people earning over Rs 100,000. Today, this has become a huge problem in the country. I would like to point out that in this backdrop; we may not be able to achieve the desired goals without this tax system.  If we withdraw from this programme, we will not receive assistance from the IMF. If we don’t get IMF certification, we will not get the support of international institutions such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and countries that provide support. If that happens, we will have to go back to the era of queues. We may have to face even tougher times ahead. We have to obtain these loans and go for the debt-restructuring programme. We are not doing these wilfully. We have to take certain decisions even reluctantly. However, we will reconsider these decisions periodically,” the President said. The President said after the meeting held between Sri Lanka and the IMF on debt restructuring programme on 7 October, another meeting was held under the leadership of the IMF with countries that had given loans to Sri Lanka and some private institutions that had also given loans. Over 75 persons participated directly or through zoom technology. The primary purpose of this was to come to a common platform with the three main countries that have granted loans to Sri Lanka, namely Japan, China and India, and discuss the next steps to be taken to provide these concessions. During this meeting, the IMF and Sri Lanka pointed out the need for a common platform. India and China have informed us that they will investigate further and provide answers. These two countries have also informed us that bilateral discussions may be required. Many other countries also participated in this meeting. It is notable that, an Assistant Secretary of the United States Treasury came here. All this was possible because we are implementing the decisions taken in consultation with the IMF “There is one thing about the income of the Government of Sri Lanka. In 2015, when the representatives of the IMF came to Sri Lanka, we were told of the need for a surplus in the primary budget. Therefore, we provided that surplus in 2017-2018. But it was reduced as a result of the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings. However, there were no serious issues. They were optimistic that we would be able to increase our revenue, to have a surplus in the primary budget,” he said “At the time, our income was between 14.5% – 15% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, we agreed that we can gradually increase this to 17%-18%. However, in November 2019, the country’s taxes were drastically reduced. Then the government revenue decreased to 8.5%. There, the International Monetary Fund declared that it is unable to provide aid because of these agreements. That year we lost around Rs 600-700 billion. Simultaneously, we had to face the Covid pandemic. These issues are the main factors that led to the collapse of Sri Lanka’s economy. The IMF notified us that we need to show a surplus in our primary budget. We agreed to it because we needed their support. The other factor is that it was decided to increase the country’s income from 8.5% to 14.5% of the GDP. It’s impossible to do it all at once. We have planned to increase the country’s income to 14.5% of the GDP by 2026.” Sri Lanka then printed money because our income decreased. During the past two years, Rs 2,300 billion has been printed. As a result, inflation has risen to 70% – 75%. Food inflation has increased even more.  These need to be controlled, but we also need to secure our income. Therefore, a new tax system was proposed during these discussions. The International Monetary Fund had notified that even the export industries are required to pay taxes, the President pointed out.  It was indicated especially in countries with an export economy, taxes are being paid. The IMF also pointed out that our primary export economy was the plantation industry. During British rule, taxes were charged from every plantation sector, including tea, coconut and rubber. Therefore, we decided that if we are to move towards that goal, we will have to pay taxes. The export sector has now questioned this move and if these facts are to be submitted to the IMF, we have discussed about carrying out an analysis, he said. “The second matter is individual taxes. We have obtained the majority of taxes through indirect taxing. Even the majority of the country’s people below the poverty line had no choice but to pay taxes indirectly.   Our direct tax revenue is 20%. About 80% is derived from indirect taxes. The IMF Fund had specific questions about it and they were of the view that the amount of tax obtained from direct taxes should exceed 20%. Otherwise, they noted that this would not be successful, as ordinary citizens would be forced to pay taxes."

At the meeting on 17 October, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Russian Federation, Prof. Janitha A.

In separate cases, Priyamali and her alleged business partner Isuru Bandara were remanded until 2 November. Priyamali and Isuru Bandara were not produced in Court but were connected via Skype. Chief Police Inspector Jayantha Payagala, the OIC of the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), of the CID prosecuted. He said the CID having sought four search warrants had inspected areas such as Wattala, Kirupolana, the 34th Floor of the WTC and Chatham Street, as part of their investigations. He said having inspected the areas documents and digital items were seized. Chief Inspector Payagala told Magistrate Perera that from computers that had been seized from the KRISH office situated at the WTC, five hard discs had been misplaced. He explained that statements had also been recorded from employees, attached to seven firms owned by the suspect. He said the probe revealed that the suspect had operated a firm under the name of THICO Group of Companies, of which THICO Film, THICO Construction and THICO Gems, had been a part. SIU OIC said the inquiry had shed further light that though the suspect had no direct investments to sustain her business endeavours, she had still incurred a monthly sum of Rs 4.2 million to meet the salary requirements of her employees, as well as to pay bills of her firm. He said it had been found that the suspect’s firm spent  Rs 5.5 million to stage various promotional activities on behalf of her firm. since March this year. He then observed that the suspect had also incurred a payment of Rs 35 million, for a movie premier. Payagala pointed out that the monies were from cash she had swindled from millionaire businessmen and noted politicians. He said though she had spent such large sums of money, she had failed to earn any tangible profit from it. He said following the probe on the mobile phone seized from the suspect many messages and voice recordings had been analysed and contained information how the suspect had defrauded cash from well known businessmen and politicians, but to date such persons had failed to lodge any complaints against her. The OIC remarked that it was also questionable as to why they had failed to lodge any complaints against her to the CID. The CID stated that the suspect had maintained a bank account containing Rs 3000 million from January to June this year, while she had withdrawn that amount and spent it before her arrest. The prosecution said they had seized bank receipts from places that were searched. Hence the CID officer urged Court to issue an order to Banks to submit details with regard to how the suspect had come to both deposit and withdraw money from her accounts to expedite the probe. He explained that a few more suspects are due to be apprehended and said the suspect while being jailed had used three mobile phones and had given calls to 11 numbers via the three mobile phones. The prosecution observed that statements will also be recorded from those to whom the suspect had called. PC Maithri Guneratne appeared for the aggrieved party. He stated that his client,  had deposited Rs 226 million with the suspect. He then stated that though the CID had begun a detailed probe into the illegal financial activities of the suspect, it was still questionable, as to why the prosecution, had failed to initiate any form of action against Janaki Siriwardene, who had acted as an intermediary during the unlawful activities concerning the suspect. Guneratne PC alleged that to date, no legal action has been instituted against Siriwardene and queried as to why the prosecution, has thus far failed to apprehend her. He insisted that if the intermediary party had been arrested, the CID would be able to figure out, as to what had become of the monies that had been defrauded by the suspect.

In response, Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said, the Council of Legal Education had informed that studies in Law School should be conducted in English. Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry said, they were attempting to groom students with a bright future where they do not have to back down, just because they did not know the English language. He questioned whether students were willing to pass out of Law College knowing English or pass out without the knowledge of the language and be limited to a small area. However, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said, if they are attempting to teach English to students, it should commence from the nursery  and not when they are in College.

Market liquidity was uplifted by Rs 26,686.98 million (USD 73.49 million) led by the settlement of transactions between the GoSL and Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on Tuesday. Conversions are based on the value of the administered and benchmark official ‘spot’ which was fixed at Rs 363.14 to the dollar on Friday. GoSL’s demand-pull inflationary face value money printing (FVMP) debt decreased by 0.52 per cent (Rs 16,833.98 million) to Rs 3,211,948.75 million (Rs 3.2119 trillion) on Tuesday, thereby marginally defraying demand-pull inflationary pressure and GoSL’s MPBCs. Market was short for a record 273 market days to Tuesday, though this shortfall fell for the third consecutive market day, with Tuesday’s decrease being by 1.95 per cent (Rs 9,85 million) to Rs 495,280 million, nonetheless causing  sustained rate pressure. GoSL’s highest to the 277th highest FVMP debt has been recorded in the 277 consecutive market days to Tuesday. GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs 3 trillion for a record consecutive 72 market days to Tuesday due to a sustained lack of revenue. Transactions between CBSL and GoSL are foreign reserves neutral and CBSL which administers daily open market operations, lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T-Bill and T-Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL. GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T-Bills and T-Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot.’ The ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and lower the cost of ‘essential’ imports, while ‘essential’ imports are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee, as Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy.

This would be the lowest recorded for the period under review since 1996, where the country registered 188.40 million kgs in the corresponding nine-month period, it said. In the same period last year, the island recorded a total tea production volume of 234.72 million kgs, down 18.04 per cent (42.34 million kgs), year-on-year (YoY). Tea production is currently suffering from the ‘seven-month imported fertiliser ban’ imposed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the immediately preceding President, covering the period April 2021 to November 2021. The ban though since lifted, is still impacting the industry due to Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange crisis, made worse by the steepest depreciation of the rupee in absolute terms since independence in 1948. Meanwhile, 26 years ago in 1996, tea production was hit by a prolonged drought coupled with LTTE terrorism, which hit one of its peaks that year by launching a successful attack on the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on 31 January 1996 made worse by the deteriorating security situation, then, subsequently replete with curfews and movement restrictions which impacted tea production. Tea, for two consecutive years, that is, in 2020 and 2021, was Sri Lanka’s third largest foreign exchange earner, after remittances and garment exports, in that descending order, latest CBSL data showed.  (PA)"

Karunatilaka received the trophy from Queen Consort Camilla at the English language literary award’s first in-person ceremony since 2019. He also gets a 50,000 pound (USD 56,810) prize. Set in 1990, Sri Lanka during the country’s civil war, Karunatilaka’s story follows gay war photographer and gambler Maali Almeida, who wakes up dead. Time is of essence for Maali, who has “seven moons” to reach out to loved ones and guide them to hidden photos he has taken depicting the brutality of his country’s conflict. “My hope for ‘Seven Moons’ is that in the not too distant future… it is read in a Sri Lanka that has understood that these ideas of corruption, race baiting and cronyism have not worked and will never work,” Karunatilaka said in his acceptance speech. “I hope it is read in a Sri Lanka that learns from its stories and that ‘Seven Moons’ will be in the fantasy section of the bookshop and will… not be mistaken for realism or political satire.” This year’s shortlist of Booker Prize contenders included British author Alan Garner’s “Treacle Walker”, Zimbabwean author NoViolet Bulawayo’s “Glory”, “Small Things Like These” by Irish writer Claire Keegan, U.S. author Percival Everett’s “The Trees” and “Oh William!” by U.S. author Elizabeth Strout. “This is a metaphysical thriller, an afterlife noir that dissolves the boundaries not just of different genres, but of life and death, body and spirit, east and west,” judges chair Neil MacGregor said of Karunatilaka’s book. “It is an entirely serious philosophical romp that takes the reader to ‘the world’s dark heart’ – the murderous horrors of civil war Sri Lanka,” MacGregor added. “And once there, the reader also discovers the tenderness and beauty, the love and loyalty, and the pursuit of an ideal that justify every human life.” Past winners of the Booker Prize, which was first awarded in 1969, include Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and Yann Martel.

He claimed that many buildings, including hotels, are being built on land owned by the Sri Lanka Railways and the building owners are not paying any fees. At the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday (18), Gunawardena said, the Sri Lanka Railways owns 14,000 acres of land, the majority of which is illegally taken by various individuals. “These lands were used to preserve the Sri Lanka Railways. Individuals, however, have encroached on it instead. For example, the coastal line from Kollupitiya to Panadura has many hotels. This is a violation of public property. If lease fees are collected, the Sri Lanka Railways may be restructured. This is just one example,” he explained. In addition, he said, other State Ministry buildings have been leased to various individuals for various purposes, based on political favouritism. He said, if the appropriate fee is collected from all of these, the Government will not face any major burdens and will be able to function smoothly. BY Thameenah Razeek"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The signing ceremony in this connection was held at UN adjunct, IOM, at the latter’s headquarters in Geneva on Monday (17), an IOM official in Sri Lanka, speaking on the grounds of anonymity, told this newspaper yesterday. The majority of this grant aid is to Sri Lanka, the spokesperson added. Meanwhile, the Japanese Embassy statement further said, “UN adjunct International Organization for Migration (IOM), in partnership with relevant Ministries of the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and the Government of Maldives launched a regional project ‘Strengthening Capacity of Border Control for Responding to Infectious Diseases in Southwest Asia’ in this regard on Monday.” With a grant of $ 8.6 million provided by the Government of Japan, the project intends to strengthen overall border management capacities in Sri Lanka and the Maldives to prevent the spread of infectious diseases that would otherwise impede the revitalisation of human mobility, it said.  The dramatic reduction in human mobility has been one of the most significant effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Embassy further said. This had major economic and social impacts in Sri Lanka and the Maldives which are heavily reliant upon income from international tourism, labour migration and business travel, it said. The border closures and associated restrictions disrupted regular trade exchanges and impacted migration flows as well as exposed border management agencies and cross-border communities to higher risks of infection, the statement said. As such the component of the project focusing on Sri Lanka will improve safety and security, and support process efficiency at primary points of entry (PoEs) to ensure more effective preparedness and proactive response to potential public health emergencies due to infectious disease outbreaks, the statement said. The project will thus help interventions at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) at Katunayake and the Colombo Port in compliance with international health regulations with approximately 700 points of entry (PoEs) personnel and officers inSri Lanka, trained, in addition to the provision of improved infrastructure, the Embassy said. Designed to enable secure and safe operations at PoEs to augur international travel, boost traveller confidence and prompt a return to pre-pandemic levels of cross-border mobility, the project will address gaps in passenger processing and health screening systems at PoEs through a combination of new technology, infrastructure, procedures, training, and renovation works, the Embassy statement further said. This will streamline the management of traveller information, reduce waiting times, implement contactless processes and procedures by border control personnel. The project will also institute infection prevention measures and emergency response modalities and guarantee the safe disposal of potentially hazardous medical waste at PoEs, resulting in a safe environment for staff, travellers and crew while reducing harmful environmental and health impacts. Travellers and other personnel working at the PoEs will be the main beneficiaries of this initiative, aside from the airport and seaport workers and officials. Health Ministry’s Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena speaking of the project said, “This will strengthen infrastructure facilities and mobility of border health staff at the points of entry (PoEs), enhancing the country’s health security, whilst providing services on par with international standards, which will further enhance the implementing provisions of the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR 2005).” Airport & Aviation Services Sri Lanka Chairman, Major General (rtd.) G. A.

The Cabinet also approved the establishment of the National People’s Council Secretariat, as the national level independent central institution, for establishing the People’s Councils system. The proposal was presented to Cabinet by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday (18), Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said it has been revealed that due to the gap between the centre of governance and the people, representative democractic institutions that have been operating in Sri Lanka do not pay enough attention to the public opinion when policy making. He said, since the people’s real issues are not adequately addressed, social criticism is arising in this regard. Based on this, it has also been seen that opinions and objections against representative democracy are emerging in the society. “Under that situation, a strong mechanism, where public officials and the common people can discuss rural issues together, determine what should be done to address their concerns, is much needed. By doing so, we can prevent public oppression happening through an organised mechanism,” he said. Gunawardena also said, the ‘National Movement for a Just Society’ has accordingly presented a concept paper on People’s Council system with an independent institutional structure where public participation can be ensured for the formulation of public policies. “The concept paper also proposed the establishment of the National People’s Council and Village People’s Councils to cover every Grama Niladhari Division in the Island,” he said.

We are unable to increase the milk production and the dairy industry in the district has been severely impacted as a result,” K. Gnanasekaran, a member of Pillayar Dairy Farmers Association, in Ganeshapuram, Mandoor said. Pasupathy Ramakrishnan, a dairy farmer in the Mayilathamadu, Batticaloa said that the dairy farmers in the region had cows with 10 to 20 litre milk capacity. Following the hike in prices of livestock feed and medicines, they sell the animals as they are unable to bear the maintenance cost. “Milk production was dropping drastically in the region. We collected nearly 500 litres of milk from our farm. We are able to collect less than 200 litres now. Our dairy farmers are wondering whether to continue or stop breeding dairy cattle”, Ramakrishnana said. He said, there was no any difficulty in geting livestock feed. One tractor of hay is sold at Rs 15,000, one kilo of bran is sold at Rs 120 and livestock medicines were skyrocketing. However the price of fresh milk remains at low level. At this juncture increasing the milk production seems to be a difficult task. In the event the Government fails to help the dairy farmers, the dairy industry will vanish from the region very soon, he added. Rasaiah Suresh, a dairy farmer in Kiran, in Eravur, said that when the Government instructed them to increase milk production in order to meet the national demand, the dairy farmers bought dairy cows taking loans from finance companies. As they were not receiving reasonable price for milk they are struggling to pay off those loans. “The livelihood of dairy farmers has totally collapsed. A stipulated price of one litre of fresh milk must be set at Rs 200 or we will have to take to the road with our cattle to stage protests,” Suresh said. “The Government must reduce the price of livestock feed and medicines taking the critical situation of dairy farmers into consideration. Then we will be able to increase the milk production. If not we would have to stop dairy cow breeding. If we stop breeding, the Government must recommend an alternative livelihood mode for us,” Suresh added. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

Sara Jasmine is wife of Atchchi Muhammadu Muhammadu Hasthun, the suicide bomber responsible for the Katuwapitiya St. Sebastian’s Church bombing on 21 April 2019.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/10/18/draft-rehabilitation-law-would-spur-abuse-hrw/,Draft ‘Rehabilitation’ Law would spur abuse – HRW,Author not found,0,2022-10-17T20:30:00+00:00,"The Government should withdraw a draft law that would give the authorities broad powers to detain people in military-run “rehabilitation” centres, placing them at great risk of abuse, Human Rights Watch said yesterday (17). The Bureau of Rehabilitation Bill, submitted to Parliament on 23 September, would allow the compulsory detention in centres of “drug dependant persons, ex-combatants, members of violent extremist groups and any other group of persons.” The Bureau of Rehabilitation Bill would establish a new administrative structure controlled by the Defence Ministry to operate “rehabilitation” centres staffed by military personnel. The proposed law, which human rights advocates have already challenged in the Supreme Court, does not describe the basis for being sent for “rehabilitation,” but other recent government policies provide vague and arbitrary powers to forcibly “rehabilitate” people who have not been convicted of any crime. “The Sri Lankan Government’s proposed ‘rehabilitation’ efforts appear to be nothing more than a new form of abusive detention without charge,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch. “The Rehabilitation Bill would open the door widely to more torture, mistreatment, and endless detention.” The Sri Lankan Government has previously used coercive “rehabilitation” centres to enable arbitrary detention and torture. Following the war, which ended in 2009, thousands of people whom the Government identified as members of the defeated separatist LTTE were detained in military-run “rehabilitation” centres, where some were allegedly tortured and subjected to other abuses, including sexual violence. The current Bill seeks once again to “rehabilitate” “ex-combatants” 13 years after the war ended. The Rehabilitation Bill is the latest measure in a long history of laws, such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), that authorise arbitrary detention and torture in Sri Lanka. The law could be used to target minority communities or anti-government protesters whom President Ranil Wickremesinghe has labelled “extremists.” Under the Rehabilitation Bill, which would allow prolonged detention without judicial oversight, government officials would be protected from criminal liability for their actions if they act “in good faith.” The Bill also empowers officials to use undefined “minimum force” to “compel obedience” from detainees. Another provision provides that an official who “without reasonable cause” strikes, wounds, ill-treats, or wilfully neglects anyone under rehabilitation can be punished by up to 18 months in prison, suggesting that there might be a “reasonable cause” to harm detainees. International law absolutely prohibits torture, and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Rehabilitation Bureau Bill and the proposed amendment to anti-narcotics legislation are only the latest measures in President Wickremesinghe’s assault on fundamental rights, Human Rights Watch said. An attempt to use the Official Secrets Act to restrict public gatherings in the capital, Colombo, was withdrawn earlier in October amid widespread objections that the action was unlawful. On 6 October, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution expressing concern at the human rights situation in Sri Lanka and mandating enhanced UN monitoring, as well as renewing a mandate for the UN to collect and analyze evidence of past human rights violations for use in future prosecutions. “President Wickremesinghe is pursuing abusive and repressive policies that make it difficult for Sri Lanka’s international partners to wholeheartedly back desperately needed economic measures,” Ganguly said. “Foreign governments should make clear that they will support the urgent needs of the Sri Lankan people, but they will also take action through targeted sanctions and other measures against those committing serious human rights violations.”"

The late Major General Vijaya Wimalarathna was the founder and father of this prestigious regiment. They initiated grooming infantrymen with determination and bravery to eradicate the ruthless LTTE from the motherland. These veterans, with their motto “unity is strength” are commemorating their 39th anniversary today (14). Last 39 years of their proud history, they passed several special milestones, including expansions of battalions and military operations against terrorists at Kokilai (1985), Trincomalee, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Omanthai, Puliyankulam, Kanagarayankulam, Mankulam and several other Northern areas. Among them, operation Vadamarachchi (1987) is an unforgettable highlight in the chronicles of both 1 and 3 GR battalions and much more, including the last humanitarian operations. 175 Officers and 4,075 Other Ranks of this veteran regiment’s family were sacrificed during the operations conducted to gain Sri Lanka’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Among them, Lieutenant K.W.T. Nissanka, Captain P.N. Punsiri, Major W.M.I.S.B. Walisundara, and Warrant Officer II Gunasekara MBG were awarded  the Parama Weera Wibhushana (PWV) for their bravery in action. The regiment produced one Executive President and two Army Commanders. Presently the regimental centre is located in Saliyapura, Anuradhapura. The Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Vikum Liyanage is the present Colonel of the Regiment while Brigadier Vishavajith Vidyananada is the Centre Commandant. To mark the 39th anniversary of the veterans, an all-night pirith chanting followed by alms giving to the monks to offer merit to fallen and wounded war heroes was undertaken recently in Saliyapura.  Floral tributes to fallen war heroes and a military parade to the commander of the Army was also held with the participation of family members of fallen war heroes, regimental council members, members of Seva Vanitha Unit, officers and Other Ranks.

Following the loss, the Lankan skipper has said that it’s a worrisome sign for the team. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Shanaka said, “We didn’t execute our plans well. I think we went for the yorkers and we didn’t execute with low full tosses and half volleys. I think that’s where it went wrong. I think if they had stuck to that hard length, wicket-to-wicket, like the Namibian bowlers did really, really well, it would have been different.” After being put into bat first, Namibia posted 163 for 7 in 20 overs. With 93 for 6 in 14.2 overs, Namibia were in deep trouble. Jan Frylinck (44 off 28b; 4×4) and JJ Smit (31* off 16b; 2×4, 2×6) put on a 70-run stand for the seventh wickets in just 34 balls. The partnership proved to be a match-winning one. Lanka will now need to avoid any further slip-ups against Netherlands and United Arab Emirates to progress, and could even then see their fortunes come down to run rate permutations. Interestingly, Sri Lanka have come into the World Cup after winning the Asia Cup in UAE. On the other side, Namibia still made it through to the Super 12 stage in 2021, and captain Gerhard Erasmus said his side has taken great confidence from that experience at the top level.

To overcome the economic crisis that we are facing as a country, the President advised us to take necessary steps to cultivate all the cultivable lands. Accordingly, information regarding uncultivated lands that are cultivable within all Grama Niladhari Divisions across Sri Lanka should be collected urgently,’’ he said. He added that the aim of this move is to give these lands to the younger generation, who can cultivate them for a period of around 2 years to provide a quick solution to this economic crisis. Gunawardena added that all necessary steps have been taken to commence the Rural Economic Revitalisation Committee programme with a view to controlling the increase in food commodity prices in the country and that the programme will commence in Galoya. The programme seeks to formalise and accelerate the upliftment of the rural economy. The five public officers representing the village are responsible for achieving these goals, he said."

While the tax hike will invariably impact businesses and private sector employees adversely in the current context of high inflation and negative economic growth, however, it is the widely held perception of the tax revenue not being fully utilised for the benefit of the people, it said. Hence, it is imperative that the GoSL effectively communicates the actions it is taking to reduce GoSL expenditure and prioritise spending on areas that are critical to the public, it said. As a part of the fiscal reform agenda, the focus should be in terms of rationalising and curbing GoSL expenditure wherever possible. In 2021, 31 per cent of the recurrent expenditure was on public sector salaries, of which 30 per cent was spent on provincial councils, while 34 per cent was absorbed by defence, policy, and public security, CCC said. “These expenditures must be relooked at in terms of the current priorities of stimulating growth and the need to reallocate expenditure towards spending on more critical areas like public education, health, and research and development, CCC said. In addition, greater accountability, transparency, and governance of existing GoSL expenditure along with visible steps to curb corruption are also essential requirements to motivate taxpayers in knowing that their contribution is being well spent, it said. To drive higher tax collection, the existing taxpayer base will need to be widened further so that the burden does not fall on the current base consisting of a small number of corporates and the salaried workforce to a large extent, CCC advised. This will require significant reform in tax administration and improving the capacity of key revenue collecting agencies to reduce the leakages and ensure greater compliance. Policymakers should make better use of digital solutions to link existing GoSL agencies and efforts like the introduction of a digital ID should be prioritised in this regard, it said. The fiscal reform agenda will need to be complemented with genuine efforts to unlock growth and investment opportunities through state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform, improvement in the ease of doing business and investment climate, and providing a more conducive trade policy environment for exports to flourish, said CCC. This will ensure that growth does not stagnate in the next few years and there will be opportunity for the private sector to reinvest and create more economic activity that will stimulate tax collection. “We hope that the improvements made to the fiscal framework will steer forward the discussions with the IMF and help mobilise financing to address the current shortfalls in external cash flow,” CCC in conclusion said.

He said, it is questionable why Solheim was appointed as the Presidential Adviser on Climate Change with his ‘negative credentials.’ “The so-called peace envoy, Solheim has re-emerged as the Presidential Adviser on Climate Change. In fact, he has no credentials to hold this post. He became the UN Environment Head because of Norway’s huge monetary contribution to the UNEP. He wasted USD 500,000 for his foreign travel within 22 months. He was subject to bitter criticism by environmental experts,” he stressed. Speaking to the media yesterday (17), Gammanpila claimed, Solheim had grossly violated regulations of the UNEP and because of these reasons, the UN Secretary-General asked him to resign in November 2018. “India has informed Sri Lanka that they were not in a position to provide support any further. Signing the free trade agreement is a precondition of China. Japan has agreed only to restructure the loans. Russia has no capacity to support us because of the war.  Europe is in a deep economic crisis. The IMF funds will reach us only after debt restructuring. Hence, the Government has no option but to beg before the separatists,” he said. Speaking further, he claimed, the separatists earn millions of dollars every year through human smuggling, weapon smuggling, antique smuggling, money laundering, operating shipping fleets, TV and radio channels. Gammanpila also stressed that after the war ended, they do not have many expenses.  “Hence, they now have accumulated billions of dollars. Solheim has been tasked with appeasing them by meeting their separatist demands and to obtain their money by way of loans and investment. We have no objection in attracting their funds, but not at the cost of our beloved motherland,” he said.  By Thameenah Razeek"

The report also said deteriorating physical safety and security, as well as violence against women and children also stood out as major concerns. A special media briefing was held in Colombo by the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society on 14 October, to officially launch the Complex Emergency Needs Assessment Report – October 2022, and highlight the emerging challenges and obstacles that Sri Lanka needs to overcome to combat its present humanitarian emergency. Amidst the worsening economic crisis in the country, the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, together with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), has launched its Complex Emergency Needs Assessment Report – October 2022. The report is based on surveys conducted by teams from the Red Cross in face-to-face, in-person interviews with 2,871 households, case studies of 10 estates, focus group discussions and key informant interviews, to establish the true extent and scope of the humanitarian emergency Sri Lanka is presently facing. Through in-person interviews and expert data analysis, the Complex Emergency Needs Assessment Report – October 2022 provides accurate feedback on exactly how the economic crisis is affecting people across 11 districts in Sri Lanka. The panel at the media briefing comprised Regional Director, Asia Pacific of IFRC, Alexander Matheou. Discussing the report, President, Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, Jagath Abeysinghe said, “Working at the ground level and closely with communities, we regularly hear of heart-wrenching stories of loss of hope and fear for the future. Many people, particularly single women with children, people living with disabilities, the elderly, casual labourers and fishermen, feel as though they are fighting a losing battle, just to survive. The report has taken these stories and other data into account and coherently presents these facts and figures to help policymakers, donors, volunteers, and others truly understand the ground realities, so that relief efforts can be better tailored to meet the most pressing needs first.” The report highlights concerning challenges with regard to accessing food, either because of high cost, income stress, or lack of availability. Uncontrolled inflation and loss of livelihoods have delivered a double blow to the most vulnerable communities, and even less vulnerable ones, as they attempt to cope with the unprecedented rise in the cost of living. The deepening economic crisis is forcing people to make heart-breaking choices between going hungry, buying life-saving medicine, or finding the money to send children to school. Despite the developing tragedy, the Sri Lanka Red Cross is working hard to keep up relief efforts and provide at least the bare necessities for survival. The organisation is also working, through a multitude of efforts, to match donations with recipients who are most in need, while also working to create awareness about the humanitarian crisis in Sri Lanka and draw the world’s attention to the most pressing needs of the hour."

AHEO National Convener, Disnaka Dissanayake warned that the number of cases would shoot up even more due to rainy weather. The large number of mosquito breeding sites in home, school, and workplace environments could only boost the density of the dengue mosquito, leading to a further increase in the number of dengue patients in the country, he warned. If that happens, there may be a large increase in the number of dengue patients. “Therefore, you should make sure that the surrounding environment of your home, your child’s school, and your workplace are free of mosquito breeding grounds and prevent the start of another dengue epidemic in the country.” The National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) website recently showed that by week 40 (3 to 9 October) the country had a total of 59,317 dengue cases. In 2021, the number of dengue cases by week 40 had amounted to 19,912.  The NDCU website showed that the number of dengue cases for the month of September 2022 amounted to a total of 4,527, while in September 2021 there had been only 1,370 cases recorded.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Following the loss, the Lankan skipper has said that it’s a worrisome sign for the team. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Shanaka said, “We didn’t execute our plans well. I think we went for the yorkers and we didn’t execute with low full tosses and half volleys. I think that’s where it went wrong. I think if they had stuck to that hard length, wicket-to-wicket, like the Namibian bowlers did really, really well, it would have been different.” After being put into bat first, Namibia posted 163 for 7 in 20 overs. With 93 for 6 in 14.2 overs, Namibia were in deep trouble. Jan Frylinck (44 off 28b; 4×4) and JJ Smit (31* off 16b; 2×4, 2×6) put on a 70-run stand for the seventh wickets in just 34 balls. The partnership proved to be a match-winning one. Lanka will now need to avoid any further slip-ups against Netherlands and United Arab Emirates to progress, and could even then see their fortunes come down to run rate permutations. Interestingly, Sri Lanka have come into the World Cup after winning the Asia Cup in UAE. On the other side, Namibia still made it through to the Super 12 stage in 2021, and captain Gerhard Erasmus said his side has taken great confidence from that experience at the top level. Sri Lanka will face UAE and Namibia will lock horns with the Netherlands on Tuesday. By Wichithra Weerasinghe reporting from geelong"

To overcome the economic crisis that we are facing as a country, the President advised us to take necessary steps to cultivate all the cultivable lands. Accordingly, information regarding uncultivated lands that are cultivable within all Grama Niladhari Divisions across Sri Lanka should be collected urgently,’’ he said. He added that the aim of this move is to give these lands to the younger generation, who can cultivate them for a period of around 2 years to provide a quick solution to this economic crisis. Gunawardena added that all necessary steps have been taken to commence the Rural Economic Revitalisation Committee programme with a view to controlling the increase in food commodity prices in the country and that the programme will commence in Galoya. The programme seeks to formalise and accelerate the upliftment of the rural economy. The five public officers representing the village are responsible for achieving these goals, he said."

While the tax hike will invariably impact businesses and private sector employees adversely in the current context of high inflation and negative economic growth, however, it is the widely held perception of the tax revenue not being fully utilised for the benefit of the people, it said. Hence, it is imperative that the GoSL effectively communicates the actions it is taking to reduce GoSL expenditure and prioritise spending on areas that are critical to the public, it said. As a part of the fiscal reform agenda, the focus should be in terms of rationalising and curbing GoSL expenditure wherever possible. In 2021, 31 per cent of the recurrent expenditure was on public sector salaries, of which 30 per cent was spent on provincial councils, while 34 per cent was absorbed by defence, policy, and public security, CCC said. “These expenditures must be relooked at in terms of the current priorities of stimulating growth and the need to reallocate expenditure towards spending on more critical areas like public education, health, and research and development, CCC said. In addition, greater accountability, transparency, and governance of existing GoSL expenditure along with visible steps to curb corruption are also essential requirements to motivate taxpayers in knowing that their contribution is being well spent, it said. To drive higher tax collection, the existing taxpayer base will need to be widened further so that the burden does not fall on the current base consisting of a small number of corporates and the salaried workforce to a large extent, CCC advised. This will require significant reform in tax administration and improving the capacity of key revenue collecting agencies to reduce the leakages and ensure greater compliance. Policymakers should make better use of digital solutions to link existing GoSL agencies and efforts like the introduction of a digital ID should be prioritised in this regard, it said. The fiscal reform agenda will need to be complemented with genuine efforts to unlock growth and investment opportunities through state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform, improvement in the ease of doing business and investment climate, and providing a more conducive trade policy environment for exports to flourish, said CCC. This will ensure that growth does not stagnate in the next few years and there will be opportunity for the private sector to reinvest and create more economic activity that will stimulate tax collection. “We hope that the improvements made to the fiscal framework will steer forward the discussions with the IMF and help mobilise financing to address the current shortfalls in external cash flow,” CCC in conclusion said.

The interruption, however, seemed to halt their momentum with experienced all-rounder Holder sending back opener Michael Jones, who made 20, and number three Matthew Cross in quick succession after the restart.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/10/18/draft-rehabilitation-law-would-spur-abuse-hrw/,Draft ‘Rehabilitation’ Law would spur abuse – HRW,Author not found,0,2022-10-17T20:30:00+00:00,"The Government should withdraw a draft law that would give the authorities broad powers to detain people in military-run “rehabilitation” centres, placing them at great risk of abuse, Human Rights Watch said yesterday (17). The Bureau of Rehabilitation Bill, submitted to Parliament on 23 September, would allow the compulsory detention in centres of “drug dependant persons, ex-combatants, members of violent extremist groups and any other group of persons.” The Bureau of Rehabilitation Bill would establish a new administrative structure controlled by the Defence Ministry to operate “rehabilitation” centres staffed by military personnel. The proposed law, which human rights advocates have already challenged in the Supreme Court, does not describe the basis for being sent for “rehabilitation,” but other recent government policies provide vague and arbitrary powers to forcibly “rehabilitate” people who have not been convicted of any crime. “The Sri Lankan Government’s proposed ‘rehabilitation’ efforts appear to be nothing more than a new form of abusive detention without charge,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch. “The Rehabilitation Bill would open the door widely to more torture, mistreatment, and endless detention.” The Sri Lankan Government has previously used coercive “rehabilitation” centres to enable arbitrary detention and torture. Following the war, which ended in 2009, thousands of people whom the Government identified as members of the defeated separatist LTTE were detained in military-run “rehabilitation” centres, where some were allegedly tortured and subjected to other abuses, including sexual violence. The current Bill seeks once again to “rehabilitate” “ex-combatants” 13 years after the war ended. The Rehabilitation Bill is the latest measure in a long history of laws, such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), that authorise arbitrary detention and torture in Sri Lanka. The law could be used to target minority communities or anti-government protesters whom President Ranil Wickremesinghe has labelled “extremists.” Under the Rehabilitation Bill, which would allow prolonged detention without judicial oversight, government officials would be protected from criminal liability for their actions if they act “in good faith.” The Bill also empowers officials to use undefined “minimum force” to “compel obedience” from detainees. Another provision provides that an official who “without reasonable cause” strikes, wounds, ill-treats, or wilfully neglects anyone under rehabilitation can be punished by up to 18 months in prison, suggesting that there might be a “reasonable cause” to harm detainees. International law absolutely prohibits torture, and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Rehabilitation Bureau Bill and the proposed amendment to anti-narcotics legislation are only the latest measures in President Wickremesinghe’s assault on fundamental rights, Human Rights Watch said. An attempt to use the Official Secrets Act to restrict public gatherings in the capital, Colombo, was withdrawn earlier in October amid widespread objections that the action was unlawful. On 6 October, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution expressing concern at the human rights situation in Sri Lanka and mandating enhanced UN monitoring, as well as renewing a mandate for the UN to collect and analyze evidence of past human rights violations for use in future prosecutions. “President Wickremesinghe is pursuing abusive and repressive policies that make it difficult for Sri Lanka’s international partners to wholeheartedly back desperately needed economic measures,” Ganguly said. “Foreign governments should make clear that they will support the urgent needs of the Sri Lankan people, but they will also take action through targeted sanctions and other measures against those committing serious human rights violations.”"

Abdur Rouf Talukder, Governor of Bangladesh Bank, provided a positive outlook on the matter after a meeting with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Nandalal Weerasinghe, in the United States. The Central Bank Chief travelled to Washington, D.C., to attend the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The two governors held a discussion on the sidelines of the seven-day event which began at the World Bank Headquarters on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Talukder said, “We [Bangladesh] gave USD 200 million to Sri Lanka under a currency swap agreement. But due to Sri Lanka’s economic crisis, they could not return the money on time.” In light of the crippling economic crisis that gripped the island nation, Bangladesh twice extended the deadline for repayment on Sri Lanka’s request, Talukder said. “Sri Lanka is supposed to return it in three instalments in February and March 2023.” On the talks with Weerasinghe, Talukder said, “We had a very good meeting. The Governor assured me that they will meet the deadline for repayment. They are now restructuring their debts and have spoken to India, Japan, and China about it.” “And Sri Lanka is also working on a deal with the IMF that has also been roughly confirmed. A final agreement on the programme will probably be reached between November and December.” Last year, Bangladesh agreed to give Sri Lanka loans of at least USD 200 million from its foreign exchange reserves under a currency swap deal. The credit was to be repaid in instalments over three months, the Central Bank said at the time. But as the economic and political crisis in Sri Lanka worsened, its external debt became unsustainable. With political stability gradually being restored, Sri Lanka is now moving towards repaying its debts. Central Bank Governors from Commonwealth countries are also holding a meeting on Friday. Bangladesh has been given the opportunity to chair the meeting, according to Talukder. The Governor is leading an 11-member Bangladeshi delegation at the annual event in place of Finance Minister A.H.M. Mustafa Kamal, who could not make the trip. Talukder also met the Vice Chairman of the US banking giant JPMorgan and the Managing Director of Standard Chartered’s Asia-Pacific region. “They want to offer various facilities to Bangladesh. We told them that we appreciated their interest. If we increase the size of our loans in future then why not. We asked them to support our private sector.” (bdnews24.com)"

However, the people are disorganised, which is why the second uprising must be organised by the JJB, Dissanayake said. “Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to flee Sri Lanka. Former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was compelled to flee Temple Trees and seek refuge at the Trinco naval base. Basil Rajapaksa was unable to get a flight to leave the country. The Rajapaksa camp, which was once rock solid, crumbled in front of our very eyes. From this, it is clear that the people have power. However, the people are disorganised.

He said a key responsibility is to protect the people in the face of the country’s bankruptcy. “Production in the country has collapsed and inflation has increased greatly. People are losing their jobs. Monthly wage earners cannot pay off their loans. People are rising up against this oppression,” he said.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Addressing the Divisional Council in Kesbewa on Saturday (15) Dissanayake said the people have real power because they were able to depose the ‘Rajapaksa’ clan. However, the people are disorganised, which is why the second uprising must be organised by the JJB, Dissanayake said. “Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to flee Sri Lanka. Former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was compelled to flee Temple Trees and seek refuge at the Trinco naval base. Basil Rajapaksa was unable to get a flight to leave the country. The Rajapaksa camp, which was once rock solid, crumbled in front of our very eyes. From this, it is clear that the people have power. However, the people are disorganised. The JJB is currently organising people through Divisional Councils,”Dissanayake said. He said a key responsibility is to protect the people in the face of the country’s bankruptcy. “Production in the country has collapsed and inflation has increased greatly. People are losing their jobs. Monthly wage earners cannot pay off their loans. People are rising up against this oppression,” he said. Dissanayake said the Government is trying to push such an uprising into violence. Therefore, the JJB Division Council should give leadership to well-organised groups, he said.

He said one problem in regard to fertiliser is that there are bills of Rs 8 billion from last year and the Government has settled about Rs 4 billion. “I am here to review the implementation of the Food Security Programme in the Ampara District. We also identified the shortcomings in the implementation of the programme at rural level. The problem of organic fertilisers was raised. The distribution of organic fertiliser was made by the Ministry last year, but this year we have left it to the companies. So, those companies will provide the fertiliser. Secondly, discussions will be held with the Civil Security Department and relevant officials for this endeavour. We did not mention the armed forces, that make a considerable contribution to production. Therefore, we should also involve the armed forces in this programme,” he said. Speaking further, he also said although food could not be brought in during the Second World War, the economy did not collapse. He said now the economy has collapsed and this year the economy has recovered somewhat, in comparison to last year. “But still there are issues. If we print money, the inflation rate would rise. There are limitations when dealing with the available money. Somehow, we should all come together to find solutions to these problems. What the people need to do now is to commence the cultivation activities in their own areas and report it. Thereafter, our food security bureau will inform us about the types of food that we require. There is no issue with paddy cultivation. If this season is successful, we will have an excess stock. Production of crops such as maize should be increased. I request you to obtain additional space for such crops and carry out cultivation,” he added. He said first, food security should be ensured, and second, a food programme should be launched to eliminate malnutrition. “We too would support them. Food banks and community kitchens have been set up to support this programme. We are going through a difficult period and we must not allow anyone to starve. Once the next Maha Season is successful, we can move forward and we need to continue this programme until the end of 2023. Even if our problem is solved, a global food crisis may arise, so we have to continue this programme to ensure food security in our country,” he further said."

He said in 2021, 80,000 parent animals were imported to Sri Lanka to breed chickens but in 2022, due to a lack of foreign exchange and the suspension of parent animal exports by countries such as India, the import of parent animals to Sri Lanka has been reduced to 7000. He said although the annual production of eggs was between 1000-3000 million, in 2021, due to the lack of chemical fertiliser, production of maize dropped and although the production of eggs in Sri Lanka was 2934 million in 2021, by June 2022, the production of eggs in Sri Lanka has decreased by 34 per cent to 1,963 million. He further said although the per capita consumption of eggs in this country was 35 ten years ago, it is expected to increase to 125 by the end of 2022.

He said, he discussed the problems of those involved in the palmyrah industry with Minister Pathirana, and that the latter promised him that an expeditious solution would be found to the issues. After 40 years, the Palmyrah Development Board finally has its own building. According to Minister Devananda, Minister Pathirana also praised the Palmyrah Development Board officials for their prompt action. He expressed confidence that a huge sum of money paid for the rented building where the Board was functioning can be saved today and can be used for the development of the palmyrah industry and to raise the living standards of people depending on it as well. Devananda said that during the discussion it was clear that Minister Pathirana has well-understood the problems the people engaged in palmyrah-related industries were facing and expressed confidence that it will be able to address those issues soon. “When I was the Minister of Trade and Small Industries I shifted the head office of Palmyrah Development Board from Colombo to Jaffna in 2010.

He said because this country’s population is so small in comparison to countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, pharmaceutical companies cannot launch products aimed solely for citizens. The Minister also said an unprecedented 66 per cent inflation occurred today, and the World Bank stated in its most recent report that food inflation is 94 per cent. “Controlling inflation will be impossible unless we pay attention to this and implement special programmes. It is strictly forbidden to hold any type of ceremony in the Ministry. We need to import 25-30 per cent more medicines next year, and I informed the authorities that I would not import medicines next year after comparing the amount brought in previous years. The lower middle class is facing serious economic difficulties. Many of them cannot afford private medical care,” he explained. He said, low-income families use state-run hospitals because they cannot afford private hospital bills. He noted that the next generation cannot be raised in poor health. “It is completely wrong to claim that Indian loan assistance was not used to bring medicines. Something of that sort had been reported in the media. Thousands of documents have been sent to the Indian Embassy. They were sent to Delhi with great effort. Then approval has to be obtained.

According to the report, as the remaining residents do not meet the minimum requirements it is not possible to provide houses in accordance with standards approved under the Urban Revitalisation Project. Kajimawatta, which caught fire recently comes under the purview of the National Housing Development Authority and is about five acres in extent. According to the report, Kajimawatta was handed over to the UDA on a temporary basis to run an intermediate camp under the initial urban revitalisation project in 2011 until permanent houses were provided to families residing on those lands. When the UDA releases land to construct apartment complexes, displaced families are temporarily settled in Kajimawatta. The number of families that were settled in that instance was 275 and Kajimawatta was subsequently emptied when families were given housing units. However, on several occasions, about 50 family units were settled in this intermediate camp. However, due to political intervention, after 2014 about 291 unauthorised families were settled on this land. The report also states that following the 2015 presidential election, people from different areas have been illegally settled here on several occasions due to political interference. But the urban revitalisation plan implemented in that year removed all squatters from Kajimawatta and the land was freed of residents.But since January 2016, 291 illegal residents have been resettled in Kajimawatta. It is further stated that according to instructions of the Ministry of Metropolitan and Western Development, the Management in 2019 approved 57 housing units to be given to families that fulfilled the minimum requirements."

Over the past decade, Beijing has been the lender of choice for many nations. It doled out funds for governments to build bullet trains, hydroelectric dams, airports, and superhighways. However, as inflation climbed and economies weakened, China found itself in a precarious situation. Keith Bradsher, writing in The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH), said China holds significant sway over the financial futures of many nations and owes huge sums of money that may never be repaid in full forcing its officials to act as debt collectors in poor countries. When Suriname couldn’t make its debt payments, a Chinese State Bank seized the money from one of the South American country’s accounts. When Kenyans and Angolans went to the polls in the Presidential Elections in August, the countries’ Chinese loans, and how to repay them, were a hot-button political issue, the SMH report said. The economic distress in poor countries is palpable, given the lingering effects of the pandemic, coupled with high food and energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Many borrowed heavily from China. In Pakistan, overall public debt has more than doubled over the past decade, with loans from China growing fastest. In Kenya, public debt is up ninefold and in Suriname tenfold, it said. The nature of China’s loans is compounding the challenges. China issues far more loans to poor countries at adjustable interest rates than Western governments or multilateral institutions. With global interest rates rising swiftly, debt payments are soaring when these nations can least afford to pay. Bureaucratic warfare among powerful government ministries in Beijing has already forestalled any easy solution to the debt problem and threatens to delay it further. A new slate of ministers will take over in March, likely restarting the process to address debt issues, reported SMH. Notably, China and the United States have favoured different approaches to debt troubles. In the past, Beijing has tended to lend more money to some countries, including Argentina, Ecuador, and Pakistan, so that they can continue to make payments on existing loans. China’s approach helps these countries afford imports of food and fuel, but leaves them with ever more debt. The United States prefers requiring government agencies and banks to forgive part of their loans. This was done during the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s, so that borrowers could afford to repay the interest on the remaining debt. But this approach requires banks to immediately accept heavy losses, a tough sell in China given its economic slowdown and housing crisis. Bradsher said weakening home prices and stalled real estate transactions have already left Chinese banks with bad loans to developers and homebuyers. Those conditions also mean that Chinese banks are reluctant to lend more to countries, including under the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s policy framework for developing countries. According to the IMF, three-fifths of the world’s developing countries are now having considerable trouble repaying loans or have already fallen behind on their debts. More than half the world’s poor countries owe more to China than to all Western governments combined. (ANI)"

Premier Dinesh Gunawardena who was the keynote speaker at this event said, “Nearly 30 to 35 per cent of the population directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture for their livelihood in the country. Sri Lanka needed to invest deeply in modernising and developing the agriculture sector, adding that his “Government is fully committed to achieving this gigantic task.

We also identified the shortcomings in the implementation of the programme at rural level. The problem of organic fertilisers was raised. The distribution of organic fertiliser was made by the Ministry last year, but this year we have left it to the companies. So, those companies will provide the fertiliser. Secondly, discussions will be held with the Civil Security Department and relevant officials for this endeavour. We did not mention the armed forces, that make a considerable contribution to production. Therefore, we should also involve the armed forces in this programme,” he said.

There is no issue with paddy cultivation. If this season is successful, we will have an excess stock. Production of crops such as maize should be increased.

He said in 2021, 80,000 parent animals were imported to Sri Lanka to breed chickens but in 2022, due to a lack of foreign exchange and the suspension of parent animal exports by countries such as India, the import of parent animals to Sri Lanka has been reduced to 7000. He said although the annual production of eggs was between 1000-3000 million, in 2021, due to the lack of chemical fertiliser, production of maize dropped and although the production of eggs in Sri Lanka was 2934 million in 2021, by June 2022, the production of eggs in Sri Lanka has decreased by 34 per cent to 1,963 million. He further said although the per capita consumption of eggs in this country was 35 ten years ago, it is expected to increase to 125 by the end of 2022.

This initiative will take place within the next six months, coming as a reaction to the issues associated with procuring life-saving post-exposure treatment for humans caused by Sri Lanka’s current economic crisis. “We have to take rabies seriously. This is one of the world’s most deadly infectious diseases and is endemic in Sri Lanka. The heartbreaking thing about rabies is that all of the deaths, whether human or animal, are needless as they can be prevented,” saidDr. Janey Lowes, Founder and Head of Organisation at WECare. Rabies is virtually 100% fatal once symptoms appear. According to the WHO, rabies transmission is preventable through the vaccination of dogs and the prevention of dog bites. The Department of Health recognises that maximum impact is gained when all organisations, including the Department of Animal Production & Health and NGOs like WECare Worldwide, work together. W.C. Devasurendra, PHI Anti-Rabies Unit, Matara said, “For the elimination of rabies, it will be the duty and the responsibility of every person to support the Anti-rabies activities.” There have been numerous suspected and confirmed rabies cases at WECare’s veterinary hospital in Gandara, dedicated to street animals. Since 2014, WECare has vaccinated almost 15,000 animals, but has now decided to upscale its efforts as an emergency measure, vaccinating and microchipping more than 7,000 dogs within only six months. The initiative is executed by WECare, and its partner Battersea, one of the UK’s oldest and most well-known animal welfare charities. This Battersea-funded programme will last six months, but WECare Worldwide plans to continue its increased efforts for at least the next three years. Currently, the Charity is expanding their organisation to include a dedicated outreach team of veterinarians, nurses, dog catchers, data managers and assistants to continue after the initial programme. “As veterinarians, we have the duty not only to the animals we serve but also to the public by protecting them from any diseases that spread from animal to human.” This six-month pilot project takes place in the southern province of Sri Lanka, between the cities of Matara and Dickwella. It will offer free rabies vaccination to the street- and privately-owned dogs and cats. People living in this area can contact the organisation to get their pets vaccinated, helping Sri Lanka eradicate this deadly disease. “We are committed to making rabies a thing of the past and collaborating with the government and other hard-working NGOs in this effort,” said Dr. Janey Lowes."

Prof. Arjuna Parakrama, President of PAFTA expressed these views, yesterday (13) in a special statement regarding the specific incident, on the 14 September, in which he confirmed that a group of students studying law in the Faculty of Arts were assaulted while they were dining in the canteen and were subsequently prevented from entering the canteen premises and that this practice has been continuing for years now. “Due to the behaviour of ‘Raggers’ the ‘Anti-Raggers’ are forced to find other inadequate spaces for their daily interactions and even to have their meals. The violent and intolerant culture of the rag in the universities is such that anti-raggers are either prevented from residing in the halls of residence or hounded out of the halls of residence through other means,” Prof. Parakrama noted. Prof. Parakrama further claimed that to return to the specific incident, on the 14th of September a group of students from the Department of Law, who could find no other place, decided to have their midday meal in one of the two main student canteens in the vicinity, which later has resulted in a faction of the Rag Group to assault these students, and to later bar the Law students’ from entry into the canteen. “On hearing the commotion, the Dean of the Arts Faculty, along with other members of the staff, intervened and made it clear on that occasion that all public areas of the University commonly accessed by students, were open to all students, with no exceptions at all. However, promises made at this meeting were willfully broken within hours, resulting in further violence against these Law students. To end this spiraling cycle, the Dean, on the basis of the Faculty Board’s decision, asked for a written assurance on the part of the two affected student groups and the student union, the official representative body of the students, guaranteeing their commitment to free and open access to the canteens and other common facilities to all,” he noted. Meanwhile, he alleged that initially, in the interest of protecting the anti-rag group, on-site classes were converted to the online mode. “However, after further discussion and clear intransigence on the part of the union and its allies, who alone of the three groups refused to provide such a letter, it was decided that until such an assurance is made, all academic activities of the Faculty of Arts should be suspended as such activities cannot be conducted in an environment of violence and intimidation. To date, the Student Union has failed to provide such assurance,” he added.Further, Prof. Parakrama noted that subsequent to the interventions made by the Dean, he became the target of threats and intimidation made by some students led by the Student Union. “An effigy of him was burnt near the very canteen and he was publicly vilified at a much-publicised student union rally on the 15 September. In condemning the rag and the violence of 14 and 15 September, we can only improve the quality of education and the well-being of the university system,” he added. Prof. Parakrama noted it has to be made crystal clear that they recognise the inalienable right of students to engage in political activities and to work towards constructive social and systemic change.

Accordingly Rs 520 million to Gampaha District, Rs 193 million for Colombo District and Rs 37 million for the Kalutara District has been allocated.  Fifty per cent of compensation funds have already been released to the Gampaha, Colombo and Kalutara District Secretaries,” the Fisheries Minister said.

However, the Zonal Coordinator for Negombo Zonal Education Office R. D. N. P. Chandrasena stated, in an annexure to the letter, that the video of the Children’s Day circulating in social media is the Children’s Day celebration at Kadirana Kanishta Vidyalaya in Negombo, and the principal of the school is fully aware of the situation and the celebration. “It was revealed that there was no prior knowledge about the song being played at the time of the incident, and it was an unexpected and unintentional occurrence. There has been no fault or breach of discipline by the parties involved, and no further action is required,” Chandrasena stated in the letter. BY Thameenah Razeek"

Responding to continuous reporting of ragging cases in State Universities, CVCD issued a statement, yesterday (13), there needs to be a strong movement against ragging in civil society to encourage the new entrants to universities, and their parents, to stand up to organised groups of student perpetrators motivated by political intentions. CVCD noted that the universities face the threat of cyber ragging, in addition to physical, mental, or sexual forms. “The universities are faced with multiple issues in their efforts to eliminate ragging. These include the lack of legitimate complaints with evidence or clues for identification of perpetrators; lack of a robust system for protection of victims and witnesses, inaction of law enforcement authorities to fully implement the provisions of the Act No. 20 of 1998 on prevention of ragging, and slowness of the judicial and disciplinary procedures. In many instances, dissemination of one-sided information obtained from highly vocal student movements opposes the university administration in taking action against the student perpetrators of ragging,” noted CVCD. It is common for protests to be stage-managed in front of University Grants Commission or the Ministry of Education to pressurise authorities to withdraw or mitigate punishments that have been handed to perpetrators after due process. “In the past, there have been instances where instead of supporting the Vice Chancellors and University authorities in taking stern actions against ragging and other acts of student indiscipline and violence, undue influences have been made by external forces to the legal and disciplinary processes. This aims to protect perpetrators with scant regard to the rights of the victims and the harm caused to them,” noted CVCD. The CVCD views with grave concern the fact that perpetrators abuse provisions in the legal system and exploit the facility of taking their complaints to the Human Rights Commission. This occasionally escalates to severe harassment of VCs and university authorities. The CVCD requests the civil society to understand that ragging has been in existence in Sri Lankan universities for 70 years, with damaging consequences. The CVCD notes that the recent reduction or near-elimination of ragging as has occurred in some universities, was the result of active intervention by university authorities led by the VCs, who risked their lives and positions.

However, tea export prices gained for the fifth consecutive month to last month (September 2022), aided by high oil prices, accelerating by 4.64 per cent($ 0.22) to average at $ 4.96 per kg fob in the reviewed nine month period compared to a flat YoY growth experienced in the first seven months of the year. Tea prices move in relation to oil prices. When oil prices rise, tea prices increase, but when oil prices fall, tea prices also decline, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chairman Vish Govindasamy told this newspaper recently. Consequently, the ‘fob’ price of a kg of tea accelerated by 21.88 per cent (US$ 0.99) to a record high $ 5.52 per kg (fob), YoY last month. However, tea export volumes fell for the fifth consecutive month to last month, scarred by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s six month chemical fertiliser export ban from April 2021 to November 2021, declining by 8.02 per cent (1.88 million kg) YoY to 21.54 million kg last month. Subsequently, tea export earnings last month declined by 8.02 per cent ($10.37 million) to $ 118.93 million (fob) YoY.  Tea export earnings were Sri Lanka’s third largest foreign exchange (FX) earner for two consecutive years to last year (2021), Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data showed. According to Forbes, Iraq has remained the No. 1 major importer of Ceylon Tea with an increase of 25 per cent imports YoY for January-September 2022. Russia secured second position with a total of 17.80 million kg, though a 12 per cent decrease against total imports recorded for January-September 2021. UAE sits in 3rd place with a total of 16.71 million Kg followed by Türkiye, Iran, Libya and Azerbaijan respectively during the period January-September 2022. However, a significant decrease in imports is reported from Türkiye (55 per cent), China (19 per cent), Chile(11 per cent), Syria (22 per cent), Japan (10 per cent) and Jordon (24 per cent) YoY, Forbes said, while a notable increase in imports is recorded from Azerbaijan (10 per cent), Germany ( eight per cent), USA ( six per cent) and Poland (13 per cent) YoY, it said. ‘Fob’ means the price of the goods when boarded on a vessel for export at the exporter’s port. ‘Cif’ or ‘cost, insurance, freight’ means the price of goods, after being received at the importer’s port.

Abeywardena said that the people of this country must be vigilant of current situation and should not be misguided by false propagandas and rumours. At a time when the country was facing a severe economic crisis no one appeared take the responsibility. However, President Wickremesinghe taking the future of the country into consideration is now working with proper plans for the nation’s recovery, he claimed. Addressing the media at Sirikotha, Abeywardena said at this critical juncture, the people should act with prudence and exercise caution. As there so many expenses involved with holding the election, the current situation of this country is not ideal to go for an election. He said that ‘Aragalaya’ was necessary but it should have been a national ‘Aragalaya’. If any narrow minded political party or leader is trying to mislead the people, they must not be given room to practise their agendas and must be barred from politics. “The National Council has been established in Parliament. Arriving at a common ground remains a prime focus of the National Council. If any political party is ready to present an unchangeable development policy framework, President Wickremesinghe is ready to bring it into effect immediately. Every political party can present their proposals and plans to the National Council” Abeywardena said. “When it was announced that Sri Lanka has become bankrupt, President Wickremesinghe, as an MP raised his voice against it. The Hansard of Parliament, issued on 8 April 2022, is evidence. At that moment no one was ready to support him. The authorities of the previous government made such an announcement in violation of Articles 147, 148, 149, 150 and 151 of the Constitution,” Abeywardena stressed. “These days some people are attending the protests with their children. After that they allege their children’s rights are being violated. They were the ones who violate the rights of their children. It has been stated by UNHRC that taking the children to places where there is a war or hot atmosphere is illegal. Certain countries practise strict laws in this connection. President Wickremesinghe has instructed the relevant authorities to take necessary action to formulate a national policy framework in connection with the protection of children of this country considering all these facts,” Abeywardena added.

Wickremesinghe advised officials to discuss this issue with the Attorney General in order to take necessary steps in this regard. The President drew attention to the detention of children who were among those arrested for illegally migrating to India, and therefore were separated from their parents.

CTU General Secretary, Joseph Stalin said, this when Ceylon Today inquired about reports of an investigation by the Western Provincial Education Department on female teachers of a junior school in Negombo, who danced to the song ‘Madyapaane Bime Joliya Gaanu Nodanne.’ The video clip was circulated on social media recently. “This is not Iran, we don’t understand why everyone wants to act like the Police on this incident. This is an old song. The teachers are just trying to celebrate Children’s Day with their students. There’s nothing wrong with that,” he added. He also said, the song does not promote liquor consumption and was played only as a matter of entertainment. Meanwhile, Provincial Education Director Srilal Nonis was of the view that the teachers went beyond their scope when they engaged in dancing to the music of the song and an investigation has been launched.

Initial objections on behalf of the accused were raised by Kalinga Indatissa PC. Submitting objections, Indatissa PC, informed Judge Balalle, that charges against his client had been filed based on Provisions in Sections 189 and 190 of the Penal Code. He explained that on the face of it and upon close perusal the indictments cannot be sustained before the said Court. Deputy Solicitor General, Janaka Bandara prosecuted. DSG Bandara stated that there was no impediment to further sustain the charges filed against the accused. Taking the submissions into consideration, the Court ordered the defence and the prosecution to produce written submissions pertaining to initial objections at the next hearing and deferred further proceedings of the trial to 8 November. The Attorney General indicted the accused before the High Court and on charges of lodging a false complaint with the CID, stating that she had been abducted by a group of five persons in Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo 7, on 25 November three years ago. The Attorney General has stated in his indictment, that the accused in her complaint had mentioned that after she had been abducted, her abductors had threatened her with firearms and had detained her for hours before questioning her, regarding the whereabouts of CID Inspector Nishantha Silva who had fled the country at the time and that later she alleged that her abductors had proceeded to sexually abuse her. A Second Officer attached to the Swiss Embassy in Colombo had submitted a written complaint with the Acting IGP on 27 November, 2019, with regard to the ordeal experienced by his employee at the hands of her abductors. The CID had then commenced a probe into the incident, based on instructions received from the Acting IGP and it has been stated in the complaint, that the plaintiff had been allegedly abducted, when she had been on her way to her child’s school. The previous Magistrate had issued an order for the passport of Ganiya Banister to be impounded, as the suspect had failed to provide a statement to the CID, after she had been ordered to do so. Accordingly, the previous Magistrate, had ordered the Swiss Embassy employee, to provide a statement to the CID before 9 December 2019.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

The applications are being promptly entered into the system through Welfare Benefit Information Units set up in 341 Divisional Secretariats islandwide and as of yesterday (12), 624,714 applications have been entered into the system. A pilot project was initiated recently centred on several regional secretariats in the Colombo District and people had shown great interest, according to the Welfare Benefit Board. It is expected that the 600,000 families that have been downgraded to the low-income category, in the face of the second Covid-19 wave and the economic crisis faced by the country, as reported by the United Nations Development Programme, are also eligible to apply for this welfare benefit fast track programme. This is in addition to the 3.3 million families that are presently receiving welfare benefits or those who are already on the waiting list. Accordingly, it is estimated that 3.9 million families will apply for this social welfare programme. Hence, 3.9 million low-income families will benefit. The Welfare Benefit Board says, the programme will be implemented under six phases and the second phase is implemented concurrently with the first phase. It says the next step is to collect data through a door-to-door campaign. Those who are already receiving Samurdhi, Elderly, disabled and kidney patients’ welfare benefits as well as those who are seeking new welfare benefits should register under this programme.

When asked about the abstention, he said it was in line with the long-held practice of not voting on country-specific resolutions. “The human rights of the people of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region should be respected and guaranteed. We hope that the relevant party will address the situation objectively and properly,” Bagchi said. The comments came amid the continuing border row between India and China in eastern Ladakh. “India remains committed to upholding all human rights. India’s vote is in line with its long held position that country specific resolutions are never helpful. India favours a dialogue to deal with such issues,” he said. Bagchi said India has taken note of assessment of human rights concerns in Xinjiang by the UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights. “We have taken note of the OHCHR Assessment of human rights concerns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, People’s Republic of China,” he said. The draft resolution was pushed by a group comprising Canada, Denmark, Finland, the UK, the US, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and was co-sponsored by some other countries. China has been facing mounting criticism over its treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang Province. Human rights groups believe China has arbitrarily detained close to a million Uyghurs in camps in the name of combating religious extremism. In its recent report, the OCHCR said serious human rights violations have been committed in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in the context of the Chinese Government’s application of counter-terrorism and counter-extremism strategies. “The implementation of these strategies and associated policies in XUAR has led to interlocking patterns of severe and undue restrictions on a wide range of human rights,” it said. “These patterns of restrictions are characterised by a discriminatory component, as the underlying acts often directly or indirectly affect Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim communities,” the report said.

According to the PMD, the Government is pursuing a ‘reverse graduation’ policy for a limited time. However, at yesterday’s weekly Cabinet briefing, Gunawardane said Cabinet had approved a proposal to downgrade Sri Lanka from middle-income to low-income status. The immediate clarification by the President’s Office seems to show a rift between the Cabinet and President Ranil Wickremesinghe. “The Cabinet of Ministers has approved a proposal to downgrade Sri Lanka from a middle-income country to a low-income country. The Cabinet of Ministers decided to downgrade Sri Lanka from a middle-income country to a low-income country in the hope that, in light of the difficult situation Sri Lanka is currently facing, international institutions will make it easier to obtain loan assistance,” he said. Speaking further, he said the per capita income in Sri Lanka has decreased and at the time of independence the per capita income was USD 120 and it took 56 years to jump the bar of USD 1,000. He said, specially after defeating the LTTE, the economy expanded, the manufacturing process was boosted, and the per capita income in 2014 was USD 3,827. “There was an awakening in the mass production process. As a result, by 2014, when the per capita income reached 3,827 US dollars, Sri Lanka moved out of the low-income group and joined the middle-income group. World organisations have informed the Finance Minister that this per capita income will further decrease in 2022. To facilitate the intervention of those international organisations, so that they can obtain concessional loan assistance in another difficult situation, the Cabinet Paper was approved, which included the request to include the country in the classification of a low-income country,” he said. Meanwhile, the PMD statement said Sri Lanka no longer qualifies for International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loans due to a downgrade of the country’s credit rating. Therefore, Cabinet approved a proposal on Monday (10) to request the World Bank to grant the country eligibility to obtain loans offered by the International Development Association (IDA). This is with the aim of obtaining concessionary funding from the International Development Association (IDA) — an arm of the World Bank that helps the world’s vulnerable countries. This facility is called ‘Gap.’ Twelve countries including Indonesia have availed themselves of this facility when they were facing an economic downturn similar to Sri Lanka.

From March to September 2022, UN Women hosted a series of Multi-party Dialogues on Women, Peace and Security in nine districts to identify and discuss solutions to challenges faced by women there. Close to 200 persons including women leaders participated in the sessions, representing the North Central, Uva, Western, and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. UN Women organised the first phase of the multi-party dialogues between 2018 and 2022 in 16 districts across five provinces in the country, which focused on strengthening women’s leadership and decision-making role within the peace and security landscape. The current phase of dialogues covered the country’s remaining four provinces and took place in the districts of Anuradhapura, Badulla, Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Kegalle, Monaragala, Polonnaruwa, and Ratnapura. Participants raised concerns about issues including a shortage of safe houses, lack of awareness about available services, and weak referral systems for survivors of violence. “Over the last few months, complaints on violence against women have drastically increased, and most of the time, these women have no place to go,” said one dialogue participant, a women’s development officer from the Ministry of Women and Child Development and Social Empowerment. Another participant, a district coordinator from Gampaha District in the Western Province, said: “Because of the economic crisis, many garment factories are closing. Some women have worked in these factories for 20-plus years.  On top of that, they are burdened with taking care of their families. As a result, they are unable to find new jobs.” Ramaaya Salgado, Country Focal Point of UN Women Sri Lanka, said the multi-party dialogues aimed to gather a variety of stakeholders including women leaders, public sector officials, civil society organisations, youth leaders and the media “to collectively promote gender equality and women’s empowerment, and to ensure that there is no rollback of gains made over the years.” In each of the dialogues, participants developed district-level ‘work plans’ in which they recommended that the local authorities: Strengthen coordination between front-line government officials and civil society organisations to implement initiatives, on women, peace and security; allocate budgets and other provisions to establish safe houses for women in each district; carry out campaigns to educate rural women about public services such as legal aid and counselling for survivors of violence; provide gender sensitivity training for Police and other law enforcement officers; during the dialogue sessions, the participants also received training on the principles of women, peace and security, which calls for increased participation of women at all levels of decision-making and for ensuring that women and girls are not left behind in relief and recovery efforts. The dialogues are part of UN Women’s three-year programme on supporting the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda in Sri Lanka, which is funded by the Government of Japan. (SRM)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Under this framework, Japan will contribute to the sustainable development of Sri Lanka by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through investment and technical transfer of Japan’s leading decarbonisation technologies and infrastructure as well as promoting renewable energy, it said. A Japanese Embassy official, speaking to Ceylon Today on condition of anonymity, said Sri Lanka is the twenty third country that has entered into a partnership vis-à-vis JCM. He said typically such modalities would take about a year to be in place, after which 50 per cent of the cost of such a ‘green’ project would be provided by Japan’s Environment Ministry as a grant to the concerned Japanese company and/or its partner company/Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) institution involved in such a “clean industry” project.  The Embassy spokesman said this JCM programme, which is another form of the sale of carbon credits by developing countries to Japan, has seen Japan involved in such projects with developing countries for the past 10 years. He was, however, not immediately in a position to give the value of investment made by Japan in such projects thus far. Meanwhile, the Embassy statement said Japan has been discussing with developing countries on JCM since 2011 and Sri Lanka became the 23rd partner country of Japan’s JCM partnership. Under this partnership, the Government of Japan will be providing financial assistance as well as support in investment and technology transfer from Japanese companies to help GoSL achieve its sustainable economic growth and emission reduction targets toward carbon neutrality by 2050, it said.

Siam Nivasa was opened on 26 September. The event featured a Hun Kra Bork or traditional Thai puppet show and a traditional musical performance, followed by a workshop of the Thai puppetry art. In addition, participants enjoyed traditional Thai cuisines and desserts. The new facility will function as a cultural centre and a venue for events and activities to promote and grow the historic, warm, and friendly relations between Thailand and Sri Lanka. Thai Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Poj Harnpol, said, “Having enjoyed exceptionally warm diplomatic ties with Sri Lanka since 1955, in addition to centuries of Buddhist ties, the Kingdom of Thailand is very proud to unveil the new Siam Nivasa Multi-functional Cultural Venue. It is time that we had a dedicated space to celebrate the cordial friendship between our two countries, while also providing a functional venue for various occasions that can be used by Sri Lankans and Thai nationals in Sri Lanka. It is with great pleasure that I, on behalf of the Government of Thailand, thank all those who attended the inauguration ceremony, especially the ASEAN Ambassadors and Heads of Mission, who helped us mark this milestone with their valued and honoured presence. We look forward to working with Sri Lanka and our other diplomatic partners, as we continue to spread awareness about the Thai culture worldwide.” The event was attended by a number of diplomats and dignitaries. The Thai Government purchased this building in the 1980s. Later, due to the political situation and security concerns, the Embassy was relocated several times from Green Lanka Building at Wijerama, to the present location at Sir Marcus Fernando Mawatha – next to the Residence of Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake. "

The Memorandum of Cooperation on the JCM was signed by Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Environment and Mizukoshi Hideaki, Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka. Thereafter, the Japanese Ambassador met President Ranil Wickremesinghe and engaged in a cordial discussion. After its withdrawal from the Second Commitment Period of the Kyoto Protocol, Japan introduced the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) in 2013, to contribute to the global effort of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This mechanism has been developed to reduce GHG emissions jointly with developing countries and share the greenhouse gas emissions reduced as the percentage between Japan and the agreed party country. Japan introduced this mechanism as agreed at the 21st Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, to adopt the Paris Agreement to achieve the commitments of the Nationally Determined Contributions. Japan is currently implementing projects under the JCM mechanism in 17 countries, such as Mongolia, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Maldives, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, Costa Rica, Palau, Cambodia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Chile, Myanmar, Thailand and the Philippines. Through implementing the proposed projects under this mechanism, the benefits such as introducing new technologies and technical expertise, capacity building, generation of green jobs and new infrastructure development could be achieved. The Government of Japan and its private sector will provide technical assistance and part of the capital investment to implement this mechanism in developing countries. Under this mechanism, projects in energy, industry, transport, waste, forestry and agriculture sectors for reducing GHG emissions are expected to be implemented. Moreover, Sri Lanka ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change on 21 September 2016. Sri Lanka also has submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Therefore, the implementation of the Joint Crediting Mechanism in Sri Lanka will support achieving the GHG emission reduction targets under the Paris Agreement and contribute to the global effort of reaching the global temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Approval from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General’s Department has been obtained for the implementation of the Joint Carbon Crediting Mechanism between Japan and Sri Lanka. Further, Cabinet approval has been received on 5 September 2022 for the implementation of the mechanism in Sri Lanka. When implementing this mechanism in Sri Lanka, a Joint Committee co-chaired by the Governments of Japan and Sri Lanka and representatives of both countries will be established to approve the projects. Minister of Environment Naseer Ahmed, Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff SagalaRatnayake, Presidential Adviser on Climate Change RuwanWijewardene and others attended the event."

Complementing these developments, the stock market enjoyed NFIs for 21 consecutive market days to yesterday, also not seen for the past 31 months. Nonetheless, the stock market fell to a 43 calendar day low, with the ASPI declining for the third consecutive market day to yesterday, led by local investors exiting from the bourse in favour of the fixed income market, driven by higher rates, complemented by record-high inflation. Consequently, the ASPI, yesterday over Friday fell by 3.37 per cent to 8,744.61 points and the S&P SL 20 Index by 4.29 per cent to 2,652.99 points on Rs 3.04 billion. Meanwhile, the S&P last registered a lower figure than that of yesterday 69 days ago on 3 August 2022. A total of 91.32 million shares changed hands yesterday. Monday was a holiday for markets. The benchmark, albeit administered ‘spot’ closed unchanged for the seventieth consecutive market day at Rs 360/364 to the US dollar in two-way quotes yesterday (Tuesday, 11 October), market sources told Ceylon Today. Consequently, yesterday, the administered market ‘spot’ was down by between 80-79.31 per cent (Rs 160-161), year-on-year (YoY) in two-way quotes, thereby causing cost-push inflationary pressure, as Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy, they said. Meanwhile, yesterday, the value of this official administered ‘spot’ was fixed at Rs 362.90 to the dollar, while a year ago it was fixed at Rs 200.40, down 79.30 per cent (Rs 160.50), YoY. In related developments, the straitjacketed, inflexible administered market ‘spot’ a year ago was fixed at Rs 200/203 to the dollar in two-way quotes, unchanged for the twenty third consecutive market day to 11 October 2021. The band in which the guided market ‘spot’ may currently operate is fixed at +/- 3 per cent of the officially administered ‘spot’ value, where the latter is applicable for transactions involving the GoSL, CBSL, and/or between the GoSL and/or CBSL with the market, which was fixed at Rs 362.90 to the dollar yesterday. They further said trades in the administered market ‘spot’ (Rs 360/364) on Friday were mainly restricted to ‘bank-client’ outright trades, while the interbank foreign exchange (FX) market was however dominated by swaps, which were outside the domain of the FX market for this purpose. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction.

Australian Police arrested the pair last month after a decade-long investigation spanning several countries. The men, aged 67 and 71, worked for a company which has been accused of misconduct in South Asian countries. They are yet to respond to the charges and were scheduled to face Court on Tuesday. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) say the men arranged bribes of more than A$ 304,000 to government officials between 2009 and 2016. The bribes were allegedly made in the pursuit of two Sri Lankan projects – which Police did not name – worth A$ 14 million. The charges follow an investigation into SMEC International Pty Ltd, an Australian-based engineering firm, which involved authorities from the US, Canada, India and elsewhere. More arrests and charges are possible, the AFP said. “Corruption undermines fair competition and can have disastrous consequences for developing economies, global anti-poverty and development efforts,” Detective Supt Helen Schneider said. Originally known as the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, SMEC was formed in 1949 to build an iconic Australian infrastructure project. It has since grown to employ 5,400 staff in many countries. In 2017, the World Bank temporarily barred SMEC and four subsidiaries in India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka from bidding for any of its contracts. The World Bank said it had discovered evidence linking the company to suspected “inappropriate payments” in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. At the time, a spokesperson for SMEC said the allegations did not relate to any Australian projects, and that the company would continue to strengthen its corporate integrity compliance programmes. Protests have erupted in Sri Lanka this year over corruption allegations and the country’s worst economic crisis in history. (BBC)"

The complaint was lodged by a group of Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) members led by trade union leader and former MP Wasantha Samarasinghe. Samarasinghe said, the news circulating on social media that members of JVP and JJB had invested money is completely false and demanded an immediate investigation into the incident. “Our party is also accused of investing money in Priyamali’s business. Black money is invested in Priyamali’s business. It is clear who gave VIP protection to this woman. We consider this as a conspiracy led by people in Temple Trees,” he alleged.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/10/12/saruwa-sunil-acquitted-of-rape-charges-on-appeal/,Saruwa Sunil acquitted of rape charges on appeal,Author not found,0,2022-10-11T20:30:00+00:00," The Court of Appeal yesterday (11) acquitted former Chairman of the Akuressa Pradeshiya Sabha, Saruwa Liyanage Sunil, who was convicted over the rape of a 14-year-old child and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of 15 years in 2012. This was when the case was taken before Justices Sampath B. Abayakoon and P. Kumararatnam. Sunil was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of Colombo with the rape of a 14-year-old and after the trial, he was convicted and sentenced to 15 years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 25,000, in default of which one year rigorous imprisonment was imposed. In addition, Rs 250,000 was imposed as compensation payable to the victim with a default sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment. During the proceedings it was stated, according to video evidence, on 2 June 2012 Sunil had taken the victim to a guest house and committed rape on her. Prior to the incident, Sunil had helped the victim in numerous ways to continue her education and sport activities while a mobile phone was also gifted to her. Further, according to the evidence, few days after this incident, she was again taken to the same guest house by the Appellant and raped. Prior to the video recording she had given a statement to Akuressa Police but not revealed these incidents due to fear of the Appellant as he was the Chairman of the Akuressa Pradeshiya Sabha at the time. Sunil later appealed to the Court of Appeal. In the first ground of appeal, the Presidenat’s Counsel appearing for Sunil contended that the Trial Judge has failed to consider that the video recording, of the statement of the complainant, has not been corroborated in material particulars by evidence from an independent source as required by Section 163A (5) of the Evidence Ordinance It was held thereby that the prosecution has failed to adduce corroborative evidence in material particulars by evidence from an independent source which is a statutory requirement. It was also noted that irregular procedure had been followed by the prosecution in violation of Section 163 A (3) (b) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act, No.32 of 1999 adding that as these are substantial facts, it affects the root of the case. Considering all the circumstances, the Judges held that the prosecution had not proven the case beyond reasonable doubt and thereby acquitted him from the charge. BY Faadhila Thassim"
