Speaking to Ceylon Today on Friday (9), Prof. Chandradasa highlighted the lack of both sufficient numbers and resources to adequately support them. Expressing concern, he explained that the shortage persists as qualified psychiatric experts often migrate abroad due to inadequate compensation for their specialised skills, within the country. Prof. Chandradasa underscored the urgent need for at least 25 child psychiatrists to serve the 25 districts of Sri Lanka, emphasising the critical gap in mental health services for children. In parallel, Dr. Deepal Perera, a Consultant Paediatrician at Lady Ridgeway Hospital, highlighted a concerning trend of children being brought in with stress-related conditions, attributed to academic pressures and schoolwork. Dr. Perera observed an increase in children reporting symptoms such as wheezing, abdominal pain, headaches and sleep disturbances, despite medical investigations revealing no physiological issues. He emphasised that these symptoms primarily stem from psychosocial challenges, indicating a growing need for comprehensive attention to address mental health issues among children and adolescents.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/10/ird-ciaboc-fail-to-act-on-pandora-papers-revelation/,"IRD, CIABOC fail to act on Pandora Papers revelation",By Mithun Jayawardhana,0,2024-02-09T20:33:00+00:00,"The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) have so far failed to start any investigation into the Sri Lankans mentioned in the Pandora Papers, Ceylon Today reliably learns.  The Pandora Papers are 11.9 million leaked documents with 2.9 terabytes of data that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) published, beginning on 3 October 2021.  The leak exposed the secret offshore accounts of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers, and heads of State as well as more than 100 billionaires, celebrities and business leaders. The documents revealed how Nirupama Rajapaksa and her husband, businessman Thirukumar Nadesan, had used secretive shell companies and trusts to accumulate more than USD 18 million in tax havens and own artworks and luxury properties in London and Sydney. Both, the IRD and the CIABOC have started preliminary investigations in this regard, but no person has been questioned so far.    On 13 October 2021, it was stated to the media that a special investigation was initiated in accordance with the powers assigned to the Inland Revenue Department regarding the matter.  Also, in September 2021, the CIABOC had also started several investigations in this connection.  When JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake questioned the government on 8 March 2022, in Parliament under the Standing Order 27/2, as to whether there was any investigation launched to into the Sri Lankans mentioned in Pandora Papers, then Chief Government Whip Johnston Fernando said that an investigation has been started and the report will be submitted to the parliament within a week. However, no such report has been received by Parliament so far as well.  Accordingly, it has been over two years, but the IRD or the CIABOC have failed to initiate investigations into the matter and no one has been questioned either.  Ceylon Today also learns that the IRD needs to collect a lot of information such as checking the files related to the tax payments of the people mentioned in the Pandora papers, information regarding tax evasion and information required by the Court, but the work has not been done properly. Accordingly, the IRD should look into tax evasion, illegal accumulation of wealth and money laundering by individuals including businessmen and politicians. He also stated that IRD has not fulfilled its responsibilities properly according to the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 and the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 45 of 2022.  In this regard, IRD Commissioner General W.A.S. Chandrasekara, when queried, said “You can find out about this from the media officer of the IRD. I will tell him to contact you. He will give you information about this. I will give him your phone number.”.  However, no response was received even though 85 phone calls were made to the phone number 0112135300. On 6 September 2021, former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa instructed the CIABOC to conduct an immediate investigation into the facts revealed about Sri Lanka by the Pandora papers and provide the report within a month.  Meanwhile, writing to the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Thirukumar Nadesan claimed that he guarantees that he and his wife are completely innocent and not guilty of any crime.   He has further requested the President to appoint an independent investigator, such as a retired Court of Appeal Judge to investigate the matter as he and his wife have been affected by this incident.  However, when the CIABOC was contacted to inquire about this, Commissioner K.B. Rajapaksa said to inquire about the matter from the CIABOC secretary.  Accordingly, the CIABOC secretary was contacted after 22 calls through telephone numbers 0112596363 and 0112563713, but she stated that she could not comment on the matter to the media and that the media department should be contacted for that. More than 100 calls were made to the CIABOC’s media unit’s phone number 0112550062 provided by the secretary, but no response was received. "

Moreover, he criticised the current alignment of the Excise Department, suggesting that it should prioritise State interests rather than advocating for alcohol manufacturers and liquor shop owners. Speaking further, Aluthgamage emphasised that the existing Inland Revenue Act is geared towards tax evasion rather than tax payment, calling for reforms to address this issue. He noted the absence of specific criminal laws in Sri Lanka to punish tax evasion, advocating for negotiations to rectify this situation. Additionally, Aluthgamage raised concerns about the lack of proper inspection of goods by Sri Lanka Customs, estimating that 5 per cent of received goods go uninspected daily, potentially hindering the Government’s revenue collection efforts."

Existing channels like the Suez Canal may not be adequate, necessitating new initiatives.  India’s proposed Mumbai-Iran-Russia and Mumbai-Middle East-Europe corridors, along with projects in the Bay of Bengal and the Chongqing-Kyaukphyu corridor, aim to address this demand. Additionally, plans for the Kra land bridge by Thailand and feasibility studies for land connectivity between India and Sri Lanka underscore efforts to establish Sri Lanka as a Regional Logistics Hub, facilitating trade with South India. President Wickremesinghe highlighted the historical significance of Perth in Sri Lanka-Australia relations, particularly during World War II when Royal Canadian Air Force Catalina Flying Boats established a crucial air link between Perth and Koggala Air Base in Ceylon, facilitating vital communication for the Allies.  He emphasised the importance of the Indian Ocean, especially in light of historical events such as the Japanese attacks on Ceylon in 1942, which Winston Churchill described as a critical moment in the war. He discussed the multipolarity of the Indian Ocean region, shaped by events like the Bandung Conference in 1955 and the subsequent Non-Aligned Movement, which opposed big power rivalry. The speech outlined various diplomatic frameworks and groupings that have emerged in the Indian Ocean region, including IORA, Indo-Pacific, BRI, QUAD, and BRICS, along with increased militarization by several countries, leading to a complex geopolitical landscape.  Wickremesinghe also highlighted the growing strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean, particularly in light of geopolitical shifts and the influence of major powers like Russia, China and Iran. He addressed challenges such as attacks on commercial vessels by Houthi rebels, piracy, and threats to freedom of navigation, emphasising the need for collective action to address these issues. Furthermore, Wickremesinghe emphasised the urgency of addressing the climate crisis, noting the Indian Ocean’s vulnerability to warming and rising sea levels. He proposed initiatives such as the Tropical Belt Initiative and the International Climate Change University to mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure climate justice for vulnerable countries.  In conclusion, Wickremesinghe called for unity among Indian Ocean Rim countries to address shared challenges and create a safer, more sustainable ocean environment. He advocated for the development of an overarching regional architecture for the Indian Ocean, emphasizing the responsibility of IORA leaders in achieving this goal. The event, themed ‘Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean’, aims to foster cooperation among 40 participating nations. This conference was organised by the India Foundation in collaboration with India’s Ministry of External Affairs and the Australian Government, along with support from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore and Perth-US Asia Centre. Singapore’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan and India’s Minister of External Affairs, Dr. Subramanian Jaishankar, also attended the event."

Children sometimes show symptoms like cough and difficulty in breathing. Some children do not understand what to say, so their stomach hurts, they say their chest hurts. But prevailing conditions could trigger asthma in children who have had the condition for a long period.  Dusty conditions during school sports events and cricket matches could even add new cases of child asthma, he noted. The Consultant Paediatrician also warned that there was a high risk for children to developed asthma if they were exposed to tobacco smoke emanating from cigarettes smoked by their fathers or grandfathers, he lamented.   Smoking was not good for the person who smokes, but it is also not good for passive smokers who were highly vulnerable to wheezing and cancers as a result.   He urged parents and relatives to be more conscious of young children when smoking. "

Photographs released by the President’s Media Division (PMD) showed SJB MP Ishak Rahuman, who contested the last elections on the All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) ticket, as well as SLPP MP Chinthaka Amal Mayadunne among the delegation. Additionally, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, along with Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, are also part of this delegation. Meanwhile, UNP General Secretary Palitha Rangebandara observed that the SJB had begun to splinter, signalling the beginning of its demise. He noted that SJB MPs are gradually aligning themselves with the President, accompanying him on foreign trips to gain political exposure. Rangebandara pointed out that MPs Kins Nelson, Vadivel Suresh and Ajith aMannapperuma have already joined the President on recent State visits to Uganda, the US and Cuba, respectively.  Further, Rangebandara suggested that influential figures from the main opposition, such as SJB Chairman and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, are also rallying behind the UNP Leader. He predicted that the Opposition Leader would struggle to prevent his party from being swept away in a political storm in the near future."

Kapila – Katunayake,0,2024-02-09T20:32:00+00:00,"A group of 66 Sri Lankans, previously employed at two apparel factories in Jordan, faced adversity when the factories abruptly closed down. The factories, operated by Indian investors under the names ‘Aseel’ and ‘High Apparel’, ceased operations without warning, leaving the workers in distress. In a positive turn of events, these Sri Lankan workers have now returned to their homeland. They arrived at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake on Friday (9) morning after ensuring they received their owed salaries and other benefits. The Sri Lankan Embassy in Jordan has announced that additional workers from these factories will be repatriated within the next two days. This follows a similar effort in January, where 41 Sri Lankans were successfully repatriated after settling their salary and social security claims. Furthermore, the Embassy has disclosed that 30 workers from the affected factories had previously secured employment at other garment factories in Jordan with their consent. This ongoing support demonstrates the collaborative efforts between the eEmbassy, factory management and Jordanian authorities to assist these workers during this challenging time."

When questioned about how allowing career politicians, especially MPs from SLPP into the party could conflict with the Opposition Leader’s aspirations for a “system change”, Maddumabandara said that once these individuals join the party, they will not be able to follow the old system but rather adapt and adhere to the SJB party’s system."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/10/muttiah-muralitharan-in-a-league-of-his-own/,Muttiah Muralitharan: In a league of his own,Author not found,0,2024-02-09T20:32:00+00:00,"R. Ashwin is one away from 500 Test wickets. James Anderson needs five more victims to reach 700 Test wickets. Both bowlers, in the twilight of their decorated careers (yes, we’ve been expecting Anderson to hang his boots for at least five years now), are expected to touch these significant milestones next week when the riveting action resumes with the third Test between India and England in Rajkot next week. Impressive as the numbers of these contemporary greats are, this is perhaps an appropriate moment to marvel at the man at the top of this exalted list of highest wicket-takers in Test cricket: Muttiah Muralitharan. Because Anderson has been at it for 21 years and Ashwin for 13, and yet they are a considerable distance away from the magical mark of 800 that the legendary off-spinner breached in the last of his 133 Tests in 2010. While Muralitharan stands on his own having set this statistical benchmark, he is also the fastest to 400, 500, 600 and 700 Test wickets. The magnitude of Muralitharan’s feat has perhaps not been celebrated as much as it ought to be. The fact that he didn’t eloquently articulate his craft and talk up his achievements to the wider world may have played a part, but 800 Test wickets is just as otherworldly and out of reach as Don Bradman’s Test average of 99.94. Unlike his famed spin rival Shane Warne, whose first steps to greatness came in his second year as an international cricketer with the ‘ball of the century’ to Mike Gatting, Muralitharan took his time finding his feet. He needed 27 Tests to get to 100 wickets, which as many as 12 players have achieved in less than 20 matches. He was also battling the insecurity of plying his trade with a bowling action that was under incessant scrutiny, with bitter experiences of being called for chucking by umpires in Australia dominating his early career. The turning point arrived in 1998 when Muralitharan returned figures of 7/155 and 9/65 in a one-off Test against England at The Oval in London that Sri Lanka won by 10 wickets. It was Sri Lanka’s first victory on English soil and told us that Muralitharan, who had taken most of his scalps at home till then, could be just as much of a force in unfamiliar territory. He claimed 68 wickets in eight Tests that year, showing first glimpses of the bowler who would go on to become Sri Lanka’s greatest match-winner. Years later, Muralitharan termed his match haul of 16 wickets at The Oval as a career highlight. “Everyone thought I was a good bowler then and I didn’t look back from there,” Muralitharan was quoted as saying by BBC in 2007. If Warne had a languid approach to the bowling crease before casting a spell on the batter at the other end, Muralitharan’s flapping arms, diagonal run-up and bulging eyes at the point of delivery provided no less of a spectacle. Where Muralitharan was unique as an off-spinner was in his propensity to turn the ball a mile, using a congenitally bent right arm to his advantage to bamboozle batters around the world. Sample Muralitharan’s dismissal of former England left-hand batter Mark Butcher at Edgbaston in 2002, the ball pitching probably a metre outside his leg stump before exploding and hitting the top of off stump. That a genial smile followed these deadly deliveries added to the theatre. Muralitharan produced these moments ever so often, leaving batters perennially confused by the sharp spin and fizz on the ball. The only way they could counter Muralitharan in his early years was by using their front pad rather than bat and remember this was a time when they could get away because technology wasn’t equipped to show the projected path of the ball for leg-before dismissals. Muralitharan mastered the doosra — invented by Pakistan’s Saqlain Mushtaq — in response, causing further problems by spinning the ball prodigiously either way now. It added another dimension to Muralitharan’s armoury, as the second half of his career clearly illustrates. After reaching 300 scalps in 58 Tests, he zoomed to subsequent century milestones at a rapid rate — he took just 14 Tests to go to 400, 15 for 500, 14 for 600, 12 for 700 and 20 for 800. When Muralitharan announced his retirement ahead of the first Test against India in Galle in 2010, he needed eight more to reach 800 scalps. It was as if he had thrown himself a challenge one final time, and he didn’t disappoint, with figures of 5/63 and 3/128 across the two innings ensuring that his incredible tally was rounded off at exactly 800. Another staggering number from Muralitharan’s illustrious Test career is his five-wicket hauls — 67, which is 30 more than Warne who is second on the list. That ‘records are meant to be broken’ is a common expression in competitive sport. But there are some numbers, like Muralitharan’s 800, that are likely to stand the test of time and keep reminding us of the Sri Lankan’s genius. (Agencies) "

In response to a question raised by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, regarding the iconic building, Minister Ranatunga said the government has no intention of deviating from the price recommended by the Valuation Department for Visumpaya and the building will not be sold below the assessment of the Valuation Department.  He elaborated, “However, in response to the investor’s request, we have agreed to commission another valuation through a chartered valuer. The investor has requested a six-month period to complete this updated valuation.” Ranatunga reiterated the government’s commitment to ensuring maximum transparency throughout the transaction process.  Nonetheless, he acknowledged the government’s limitations in independently developing the property. According to reports, the government has valued the property at nine billion rupees, while the investor has made an offer of four billion rupees. The government’s vision is to repurpose Visumpaya into a heritage hotel. Constructed 190 years ago during the colonial era and originally named ‘Ackland House’, Visumpaya served as the Mess House for Officers of the Ceylon Rifles Regiment. Over time, it evolved into the Manager’s Quarters and Office for the Colombo Commercial Company, a prominent entity in commercial trade of that era. In 1971, the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Government acquired the building under the Business (Acquisition) Act No. 35 of 1971 as part of its nationalisation initiative. Subsequently, it became the official residence of D. M. Jayaratne, the 14th Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. Anura Bandaranaike, the former Minister and Speaker, passed away within its premises. Now recognised as a heritage site, Visumpaya is slated for conversion into a boutique hotel."

The Magistrate issued this order after the CID informed the Court of Rambukwelle’s failure to appear on Wednesday.  The former Health Minister was questioned by the CID for several hours on the matter in December last year. However, Rambukwella said he volunteered to make a statement with a view to assisting the ongoing investigation of the CID.  Throughout the week, civil society activists, including a group staging a Satyagraha in front of the CID Headquarters, called for Rambukwella’s immediate arrest.  Ten protesters were arrested by the Colombo Fort Police on 31 January and were granted bail the next day by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.  In addition, CID Officers questioned Dr. Saman Ratnayake, the Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Health, for nearly 10 hours regarding the procurement of substandard medicines. The probe was initiated last year into accusations surrounding a pharmaceutical company’s importation of 22,500 vials of substandard Immune Globulin vaccines.  The investigation exposed the utilisation of forged documents with the assistance of two senior State officials in the importation process, leading to a financial fraud amounting to Rs 130 million linked to the acquisition of the substandard medicine. Several suspects were arrested including former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sri Chandragupta, Sudath Janaka Fernando alias ‘Aruna Deepthi’ who owns the pharmaceutical company, Chief Executive Officer of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Dr. Vijith Gunasekera and the Director of Supply at the Ministry of Health Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake. Allegations surfaced implicating a pharmaceutical company in the illicit importation of 22,500 vials of substandard Immune Globulin vaccines. This nefarious activity involved the fabrication of documents, facilitated by the collaboration of two senior State officials, leading to a financial fraud amounting to Rs 130 million associated with the procurement of the substandard medicine. The company’s malpractice came to light after reports emerged of allergic reactions among patients who received the drug at the Colombo National Hospital on 22 August 2023 and the Matale District Hospital on 16 September 2023. In response to these revelations, the use of the controversial batch of human Immune Globulin IV and two other medicines were suspended pending ongoing investigations."

He highlights that Sri Lanka, too, has enacted this Act to ensure the protection of its citizens. The global community has recognised the importance of addressing online security concerns, as evidenced by the recent questioning of leading social media network leaders by the US Senate. Minister Alles noted that these leaders expressed regret over the harm caused to children through social networks, emphasising the need for robust legal measures. Minister Alles pointed out the rise of various unwanted activities facilitated by fake social media accounts in Sri Lanka, emphasising the essential role of a legal framework to counteract such activities. While acknowledging accusations of fundamental rights violations against the Act, Minister Alles challenged critics to provide factual evidence of any rights infringements.

Speaking at a media briefing held on Friday (2) morning, Litro Gas Lanka Chairman Muditha Pieris said the company, after taking into account the financial difficulties faced by the public and careful consideration of austerity measures that have been taken by the State, has decided not to amend the prices as required. According to Pieris, even though the price of domestic gas cylinders should ideally increase, given the price hikes in the global market due to the tense situation that has arisen in the Red Sea following attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels, Litro Gas Lanka has decided to bear the loss incurred instead of revising the prices. Following the announcement, LAUGFS Gas PLC also released a statement regarding their decision not to amend prices in February. After the price increase in January, Litro domestic gas cylinder prices have been adjusted as follows: the 12.5 kg cylinder is priced at Rs 4,250, the 5 kg cylinder at Rs 1,707 and the 2.3 kg cylinder at Rs 795. Meanwhile, LAUGFS Gas domestic gas cylinder prices are set at Rs 4,740 for the 12.5 kg cylinder and Rs 1,900 for the 5 kg cylinder."

Vijay, who is among the highest paid actors in India and played the lead in 67 films, made movies addressing corruption, leadership, and family-oriented themes, has been urged by fans to enter politics, following in the footsteps of figures like Kamal Haasan, Jayalalithaa Jeyaram, and M. G. Ramachandran. Vijay’s father is director and producer S. A. Chandrasekhar and mother Shoba Chandrasekhar is a renowned Carnatic singer. Vijay has a son and a daughter and is married to a Jaffna Tamil now living in the UK.   In his official address yesterday ( 2), Vijay announced the registration of his party, TVK, with the Election Commission on 25 January. He introduced the party’s ideology and the laws governing it. Expressing his political aspirations, Vijay stated that he plans to contest the 2026 Assembly elections, aiming to bring about a new political era. Upon obtaining the Election Commission’s approval, the party will embark on its political journey. He said that the ‘Vijay People’s Movement’ had put its efforts into serving the people through relief work and social initiatives. The inability to instigate political changes within the existing culture prompted Vijay’s decision to step into politics. Citing the perceived corrupt political culture of Tamil Nadu, Vijay pledged to work based on a vision for South India, irrespective of race and religion. He emphasised the policy of equality, stating that everyone is born equal. Vijay underlined that politics, for him, is not a profession but, a genuine and pure service to the people. Having studied politics extensively and learned from his forefathers, he declared that politics is not a mere hobby but, a deep-rooted desire."

This legislation introduces the establishment of the Online Safety Commission and aims to regulate online content, focusing on safety, prevention of prohibited statements online and curbing the misuse of online accounts for prohibited purposes. Among its key provisions, the Act is designed to identify and declare online locations used for prohibited purposes within Sri Lanka. Additionally, it addresses the suppression of financing and other support for the communication of prohibited statements through online platforms. Despite its passage in Parliament on 24 January, the Online Safety Act has stirred controversy, with opposition politicians and activists raising concerns about its potential impact on free speech. Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena endorsed the Bill on 1 February, even as calls were made to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court’s directives before approval. The legislation prompted widespread attention not only from local activists and organisations but, also from diplomats and international entities, citing various problematic aspects within the Bill. A total of 45 petitions, challenging the constitutionality of the Bill, were submitted, including those from Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), the Jathika Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and several other parties. The petitioners argued that the Bill violated fundamental rights, particularly freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution. Following the submissions, the Supreme Court concluded its deliberations and communicated its determination on the constitutionality of the Bill and its provisions to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker of Parliament. The Supreme Court emphasised that specific clauses of the Bill require passage by a special majority in Parliament, as per Article 84(2) of the Constitution. However, it noted that if amendments are made during the Committee Stage, the Online Safety Bill can be passed by a simple majority in Parliament. The determination clarified the parliamentary process for the approval of the controversial Online Safety Act."

The pigeon’s ordeal began in May when it was captured near a port in Mumbai with two rings tied to its legs, carrying a message that was said to look like it was in Chinese, local media said. Police suspected it was involved in espionage and took it in, later sending it to Mumbai’s Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit hospital for animals. Eventually, it was revealed that the pigeon was an open-water racing bird from Taiwan that had escaped and made its way to India. With Police permission, the bird was transferred to the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, whose doctors set it free on Tuesday. Mumbai Police could not be reached for comment. It is not the first time a bird has come under Police suspicion in India. In 2020, Police in Indian-controlled Kashmir released a pigeon belonging to a Pakistani fisher after a probe found that the bird, which had flown across the heavily militarised border between the nuclear-armed nations, was not a spy. In 2016, another pigeon was taken into custody after it was found with a note that threatened Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (The Guardian) "

He credited this success to the effective measures implemented by the new management, revitalising the corporation’s operations and financial standing. Speaking at a media briefing, at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), State Minister Jayakody announced a new initiative in celebration of the 76th National Independence Day. Sri Lanka has launched a programme to cultivate one million indigenous herbs across the island. The State Ministry of Indigenous Medicine, Department of Ayurveda, and Ministry of Public Administration will jointly lead this national initiative, aiming to boost domestic production of medicinal herbs and reduce reliance on imports. The programme’s first phase, running from 2 February to 7 April, focuses on all Grama Niladhari (GN) Divisions nationwide, ensuring widespread participation and impact. This initiative recognises the abundance of medicinal plants in Sri Lanka and addresses the long-standing issue of importing indigenous medicines. By promoting domestic cultivation, the programme seeks to establish indigenous medicine as a viable commercial industry. It also aims to reduce the cost of imported raw materials used in medicine production, ultimately saving valuable resources and strengthening Sri Lanka’s self-reliance in the healthcare sector. Government-owned vacant lands are being repurposed for this novel initiative of cultivating medicinal plants, providing benefits on multiple fronts. It addresses the income concerns of government employees, offering them the opportunity to cultivate these plants and potentially earn more than their salaries. Additionally, it fosters commercial cultivation of medicinal plants, contributing to a stronger domestic supply chain and potentially boosting profits. This initiative draws inspiration from the success story of the Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation, which, under new management, transformed from incurring losses to achieving a remarkable profit of Rs 195 million in 2023. This success serves as a powerful example of turning a burden into a thriving entity, showcasing the potential of efficient management and innovative approaches, he said.  Furthermore, Jayakody emphasised the need to enhance the traditional indigenous medicine system to boost the revenue of the tourism industry. By incorporating the indigenous medical system, Sri Lanka can maximise the profitability of existing tourist hotels, encouraging tourists seeking Ayurvedic treatment to visit the country multiple times. This influx of foreign exchange would significantly benefit the country economically. Indigenous medicine systems offer a wealth of knowledge about healthy living and traditional healing practices. Integrating these practices into tourism offerings presents a unique opportunity to contribute to the country’s economic development while promoting well-being. By showcasing the rich heritage of medicinal plants, healthy cuisine, and traditional treatments, Sri Lanka can attract tourists seeking holistic wellness experiences. State Minister Jayakody highlighted the potential of indigenous medicine with the Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation’s ‘Bodymantra’ massage system. This unique massage therapy, based on Ayurvedic wisdom, prevents various ailments, setting it apart from conventional massage techniques, he added. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/27/no-radiation-testing-for-imported-food-items/,No radiation testing for imported food items,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-01-26T20:36:00+00:00,"The Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board (SLAEB) currently restricts radiation testing to imported milk powder and does not extend radioactive testing to other items such as fish, mainly due to the absence of regulations governing the testing of imported food items.  The last tests on imported items were conducted during the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident, due to a tsunami in 2011. When questioned, Prof. S.R.D. Rosa said proposal has been submitted to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Council (AERC) to establish guidelines for radiation testing of imported items, addressing the current regulatory gap. For milk powder, a radiation certificate is issued before release from the harbour. However, regulations specifically exist for milk powder, not for all items. The challenge lies in some people opposing these tests as they contribute to the cost of imported items. Without regulations on these tests, the need for testing has to be addressed by the Regulatory Council. The SLAEB primarily examines radiation activity in export food items, especially since certain countries require radiation certificates. Testing extends to products like cinnamon, black tea and gems. Some fish items are tested for radiation depending on the exporting company and destination country, incurring an additional cost for certification. For export fish samples, the SLAEB charges around Rs 8,000. Following the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident, imported fish was tested for radioactivity, but this practice has not continued after 2011 when the accident occurred due to a massive tsunami.  Prof. Rosa emphasised the necessity of regulations for testing, specifying that although some tests are conducted at the industrial technology institute, they do not cover radiation. The SLAEB is the sole authority for radiation activity and there are defined limits for radiation activity in food items. A proposal has been sent to the regulatory council to activate regulations, particularly for cases where testing fish in cans is not feasible. In 2013, supported by the IAEA, Sri Lanka established baseline data for marine radioactivity around the island. During this initiative, it was determined that there had been no direct impact on the marine environment from radioactive releases related to the Fukushima accident. However, the absence of radiation testing for imported items, coupled with the potential for major health hazards, underscores the critical need for implementing the proposed regulations. "

Owing to these fish stocks, a significant environmental damage had been done to the Colombo Port premises, the National Audit Office said. This was revealed at the recent meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) held in Parliament.  Sri Lankan Customs said that these substandard fish containers were allocated to the owner of an organic liquid fertiliser production company and a canned fish company in the country, with the intention of preparing organic fertiliser. The ship transporting these fish containers encountered a technical malfunction in the seas near the Colombo port, leading to a halt in the power supply to the containers. Once it was confirmed that the fish had got spoilt due to the power outage, Thailand refused entry to the ship, necessitating the fish stocks be destroyed.  Despite the usual procedure requiring the importer to apply for a licence to unload such containers in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan Customs applied for the licence for these 102 spoilt fish containers, deviating from the common procedure.  Meanwhile, an official from the Import and Export Control Department revealed that the organic fertiliser manufacturing company took 98 containers from the ship, but only 43 were utilized. Out of the remaining 55 containers, 15 were used for compost fertiliser production, while the rest were planned for re-export. The official raised concerns about the capacity of the organic fertiliser company to handle such a large number of containers, especially evident in their decision to re-export 55 containers. Additionally, the company, purportedly having a salmon manufacturing aspect, has not been investigated for any potential irregularities. While 98 containers were taken by the organic fertiliser manufacturing company, records show that 102 containers were unloaded from the ship. Sri Lankan Customs, the Office of the Controller General of Imports and Exports and the Central Environmental Authority have no information regarding the fate of the remaining four containers. The introduction of these fish containers into the country has led to environmental pollution in the port premises and areas where the containers were stored, the National Audit Office informed the COPA this week.  This incident occurred in December 2021. When Ceylon Today inquired about the matter from Sri Lanka Customs, on 16 June 2022, Customs higher ups pledged to hold a media briefing to clear the misconceptions. However, no official statement has been released about the matter to date.  The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) also initiated investigations into the matter at that time. However, no report has been released so far about the findings of the investigations. "

Furthermore, he stated that the company had allocated Rs 1.5 billion from its 2023 profits to the Treasury through its parent company, the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation.  Peiris emphasised his commitment to meeting the domestic LP gas needs of the country’s citizens, noting that decisions at the national level, including those taken by the Cabinet, involve other groups. He also said, another committee is responsible for deciding on the privatisation of the public institutions and as the Chairman of Litro Company, he bears no responsibility or accountability for the decisions taken by that committee. However, a report reveals that Litro Lanka Gas Company incurred additional costs of over Rs 1.13 billion by purchasing 100,000 MT of gas at a higher price during the 2022/2023 period. According to the National Audit Office, the government had to bear this extra cost due to Litro Lanka Gas Company cancelling a procurement deal with a company selected to supply gas at a lower price for the year 2022-2023 and purchasing gas from another company at a higher price. This discrepancy arose when the initially selected company to supply one metric tone of gas at a price of USD 96 was replaced and gas was procured from another company at a higher rate of USD 129 and 118.83 per tone. The audit report also revealed that the government provided USD 70 million to Litro Gas Company from the funds allocated by the World Bank. Litro used this money to purchase 100,000 MT of gas at a higher price. Notably, from June to December 2022, 88,535 MT of gas was purchased at USD 129 per ton, while the stock of 9,825 MT acquired from December 2022 to January 2023 was procured at a rate of USD 118.83 per MT."

The Election Commission is now required to gazette the name of the new member who will fill the vacant seat in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Once gazetted, the new member can proceed to take the oath of office.

President Wickremesinghe has called for all political parties to collaborate in developing a comprehensive plan for the country’s reconstruction, particularly in the context of the upcoming elections. Speaking at an event held at the Sri Lanka Customs headquarters in Colombo on Friday (26) morning, the President highlighted the adverse impact of the ‘politics of promises’ on the nation’s economy. The occasion, organised to commemorate International Customs Day, observed annually on 26 January, provided a platform for the Head of State to emphasize the need for a collective effort in rebuilding the country. In addition, the President urged political parties to come together for discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding potential alternate proposals. He expressed his willingness to extend an invitation to IMF’s Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, for a crucial dialogue and potentially invite her to visit Sri Lanka. President Ranil Wickremesinghe delivered six Certificates of Merit to Customs officials for rendering exceptional services to the International Customs. The Director General of Sri Lanka Customs, Sarath Nonis, presented the Strategic Plan for 2024 to President Wickremesinghe and State Minister for Finance, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya. “I express my gratitude to the Customs Department for their contribution in helping us overcome the economic crisis faced in 2022. Customs duties, VAT and income taxes stand as the three primary sources of income for nations globally. In the contemporary landscape of international trade agreements, regional trade agreements and free trade agreements, our focus should be on enhancing income. To achieve this, the current customs services need to operate with efficiency,” he said.  “The pressing question today is how to facilitate this economic growth. The out-dated economic system is incapable of propelling the country forward. The reliance on daily loans led to the collapse of the country’s economy. It is imperative to overhaul this economic system for sustainable progress. We are still grappling with challenging times. In 2021, we faced shortages of essential goods, including medicine, fertiliser and fuel. Today, these necessities are available, with associated costs. The Cost of Living is still felt by everyone. Economic development is crucial to alleviating these issues. While it is a wish that the economic damage of 2022 could be swiftly undone, the reality is that we need to transition to a new economy. “It is imperative to carefully consider the future trajectory of our nation’s economy through open discussions. Political parties should engage in thorough deliberations, articulating strategic steps to address the challenges facing our country. Achieving solutions demands thoughtful discourse and a united commitment to charting a realistic economic path forward. Our emphasis should be on comprehensive discussions, steering away from impractical endeavours symbolised by the metaphorical notion of bringing rice from the moon. Continuous evaluation and, when needed, adaptation of existing programmes should be integral to our on-going conversation and collective dedication to progress. Our country has recently entered into an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, a pact signed by numerous countries, including 15-20 others. It is an agreement we cannot simply walk away from, necessitating collective discussion and consideration. However, the unfortunate reality is that our political landscape often resembles the fleeting nature of ‘papadam’ put in the pan, enjoyed when it blooms, and soon forgotten. The cycle repeats, with new issues emerging, gaining momentary attention, and eventually fading into oblivion,” the President pointed out."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/27/russia-and-india-discuss-reviving-emc/,Russia and India discuss reviving EMC,Author not found,0,2024-01-26T20:32:00+00:00,"Moscow and New Delhi on Wednesday held detailed talks on reviving the Eastern Maritime Corridor (EMC) connecting Vladivostok in the Russian Far East and Chennai on India’s eastern coast. The route, which was operational during the Soviet era, is the object of renewed interest from businesses in both countries amid an unprecedented surge in oil, coal, and fertiliser exports from Russia to India, as well as tensions in the Red Sea impacting existing shipping routes. Speaking at a conference in Chennai, the Indian Minister for Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Sarbananda Sonowal, called the Eastern Maritime Corridor a “game changer” that would save up to 16 days of travel, significantly cutting freight costs. At present, most of the trade between India and Russia is conducted via the Mumbai–St. Petersburg sea route, which traverses the Suez Canal and takes 35-40 days.  The Minister suggested that the EMC could be an alternative for the movement of goods given the security situation in the Red Sea, where merchant ships are being attacked amid escalation in the Middle East surrounding the war in Gaza.  According to Anatoly Bobrakov, Deputy Minister for the Far East and Arctic Development, who headed the Russian delegation to Chennai, the revitalisation of the route has been discussed by the two countries at the highest level, including between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Russia’s Arctic and Far Eastern ports account for around 40% of the country’s maritime shipping, and their freight turnover could double in the next decade with coal, crude, and LNG being the key items shipped.  All of those commodities, along with fertilisers, could be effectively shipped via the EMC, according to a feasibility study conducted by the Indian Government. The document, which has been seen by RT, maintains that coking coal is the most attractive commodity for shipping, which could be scaled up significantly via the Vladivostok-Chennai route. The study estimates the potential cargo at 20 million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) in 2025 and 65 MMTPA by 2042.  Russian officials have noted that the EMC could be further linked with the Northern Sea Route (NSR) that runs from the Barents Sea near Russia’s border with Norway to the Bering Strait between Siberia and Alaska, providing India with even more alternative routes to ship vital commodities such as crude and LNG.  Russian State giant Rosatom, which operates the NSR and is responsible for building its infrastructure, including icebreaker fleet and developing routes for navigation of vessels, maintains the rapid growth of cargo traffic along the NSR, from 3.9 million tons in 2014 to 36.2 million tons in 2023, including the transit cargo, is a “sign of demand” for the route. Outlining various prospects for deepening Russia-India bilateral maritime cooperation, India’s ports minister suggested that Russian icebreakers could be built at Indian shipyards. Moscow, for its part, has offered to train Indian sailors to navigate in icy Arctic waters, as the South Asian nation aspires to increase its presence in the far northern region.  (Russia Today)"

A video that has now gone viral shows the chained lion cub seated in the back of a white, open-top Bentley. The lion was being driven about by a Sri Lankan man, who has since left the country and is believed to be a friend of the woman, Sawangjit Kosoongnern. While it is not illegal to own a lion in Thailand, it needs to be officially registered. Authorities in Thailand said Sawangjit claimed to have bought the animal from a Thai man in Nakhon Pathom Province, who successfully facilitated its delivery to Pattaya. However, he failed to have his facility checked by officials before doing so, which made both the transfer and ownership of the animal illegal. She is therefore facing charges of possessing a controlled wild animal without permission, which carries a penalty of a year’s imprisonment and a fine of up to 100,000 baht ($2,800; £2,200). Police were also reportedly looking to charge the Sri Lankan man, who had kept the lion in his rented pool villa, but were unable to as he is no longer in Thailand. He was due to be charged with bringing a controlled wild animal into public places, which carries jail time of up to six months and a fine of 50,000 baht. The man who sold the lion to Sawangjit will also face charges of moving an animal without permission. Officials say there are currently 224 lions in Thailand that are legally owned.  (BBC)"

This statement comes in response to the US Embassy’s criticism of the recently enacted Online Safety Bill, citing concerns about the absence of input from all key stakeholders. In an official statement the Russian Embassy said, “We also take notice of all comments and reactions on this legislature, both from the domestic political sphere and among the foreign powers, accredited in this country.

In response, the NAO has strongly recommended that the Department of Railways promptly take action to recover the incurred loss from the supplier. There are a total of 200 railway crossing bell and light warning systems across the country and as of June 2023, 20 of them had ceased to be operational. The NAO’s report highlighted that the supplier responsible for these systems did not meet the necessary qualifications required for the tender.

The decision to suspend these employees was taken in the light of their closure of the cash counters during the protest led by CEB trade unions. Priyantha characterised the closure of cash counters and the inconvenience caused to consumers as ‘misconduct’.  Due to the resulting losses incurred by the CEB, the decision was taken to suspend the work of these employees.

The 41-year-old victim, a father of three, residing in Maharachchimulla was fatally shot by an SI attached to Narammala Police. The shooting occurred in Dampelessa, Narammala.  SSP Thalduwa, speaking to Ceylon Today, said following initial inquiries conducted into the incident by the Narammala Police, the ASP in charge of the District and the Senior Inspector in charge of the Police Division, it had come to light that the SI in question had resorted to his action deviating from instructions given by his superiors. According to SSP Thalduwa the SI behind the incident is aged 59 and is attached to the Narammala Police. He noted that the SI, along with a PC, had attempted to stop a small DIMO type lorry and when it had proceeded without halting, the duo had pursued it on a motorcycle. The suspect SI was remanded until 23 January by Narammala Magistrate.  According to SSP Thalduwa, the SI told the Police that he and a Police Constable (PC) had then managed to stop the lorry at Dampelessa and when the SI had tried to inspect the vehicle, while berating its driver for not having stopped the vehicle, the firearm in his possession had gone off automatically. He also mentioned that both the SI and PC involved in the incident had resorted to their actions while being dressed in civvies.  SSP Thalduwa further stressed that the SI concerned has already been arrested and observed that he will be prosecuted as per the criminal law as well as the institution of disciplinary action against him while adding that the STF has been deployed by the Acting IGP to probe the incident. The Media Spokesman pointed out that the deceased in the incident had been a civilian who had not possessed any arms and that no firearms had been located near him which could have posed a threat to the two Police officers. He explained that the SI concerned had allegedly not obtained requisite approval to carry out his duty being attired in civvies and that he had allegedly taken out his firearm having placed a note in the log book that he was leaving clad in his official uniform. According to initial inquiries, it has also been revealed that both the SI and the PC had not pursued the lorry on their official motorcycle but another. He therefore insisted that reckless conduct on the part of the SI in question had resulted in the loss of an innocent life. The Police Media Spokesman opined that Police officers who are not clad in official uniform have no legal right to stop vehicles plying on the road under any circumstance and maintained that under such situations drivers also should not stop their vehicles. He was of the view that the Police Department always deploys its officer to perform their duty clad in official uniform and on such instances the public would be able to identify the officers clearly. SSP Thalduwa mentioned that it had been around 7.00 p.m. when the incident had occurred and stated that at the time there had been no other Police officer present clad in official uniform other than the SI and the PC who were in civvies. He said certain residents and villagers in the area had behaved in an aggressive manner protesting the actions of the SI in the wake of the incident but noted that a STF team had been deployed to quell the situation. He said that certain people had damaged the gates and a few other properties of the Narammala Police Station in the aftermath of the tragedy and observed that an inquiry had been initiated to identify the suspects and apprehend them. Meanwhile, an eyewitness alleged that the lorry driver was a shot by an officer in civilian clothing. The witness informed the media that two individuals, dressed in civilian attire and riding a motorcycle, pursued the lorry. Upon stopping, one of them loaded a gun and proceeded to shoot the victim. After the shooting, the witness claimed that the victim was taken to the hospital in a Police three-wheeler. The witness emphasized that the victim, a young carpenter, was an innocent man. Another eyewitness asserted that the Police officer, who fired the shot, had loaded the gun before approaching the victim. Describing the sequence of events, the witness stated that the officer loaded the gun, approached the driver’s window, threatened to kill the victim, and then pulled the trigger. The victim, having been shot, reportedly fell onto the passenger seat. When questioned by a fellow officer, the SI admitted to shooting the victim, according to the witness."

Perera during the fracas on Wednesday (17).  Branch Union Secretary of the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS), Dr. Krishantha Jayasekera alleged, on Friday (19), that while Dr. Perera had been arrested and imprisoned over an alleged incident of assault, those who had attacked him during the heated situation on Wednesday (17) went free. “All we are asking is for legal measures to be taken against them as well,” he said.   Explaining the incident, which had led to the conflict, Dr. Jayasekera said that the Consultant Surgical Oncologist had submitted a complaint to the Director of Teaching Hospital, Karapitiya when he had been allegedly forced to cancel a surgical list, scheduled Tuesday (16), due to the strike by health trade unions. Although health service trade unions exempted hospitals and units which treated paediatrics, women and cancer patients during their strikes, all Health Assistants of the Hospital had joined the strike staged on 16 January 2024. It had resulted in operation lists having to be cancelled, he claimed.   Therefore, when the Health Assistants had reported to duty the following Day (17 January) Dr. Perera had instructed them to meet the Director of the Hospital, which had led to an argument. He said that the situation had become tensed when the Consultant Surgical Oncologist had returned to the ward that evening. He said that while the Consultant had allegedly been manhandled after the incident. The assaulted health assistant had been admitted to the Hospital.  The AMS Branch Secretary alleged that the pressure against Dr. Perera had increased by Thursday (18) with a demand for his arrest. It resulted in his arrest and subsequent imprisonment.  Dr. Jayasekera lamented that the situation had resulted in Dr. Perera submitting his premature resignation letter when he had another two years in service. This situation would only result in patients having to suffer even more.          The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said any form of action should be taken following an impartial inquiry into the incident. The Hospital Authorities should ensure that the team spirit and unity within the Teaching Hospital was not affected by the said incident as it would only disrupt the Teaching Hospital’s service to the public and patient care.  Health Trade Unions accused the AMS of attempting to take the issue to another level, when they knew that this was not the first time that the particular doctor had been taken to task for allegedly assaulting a co-worker.  Meanwhile, the Alliance of Health Trade Unions warned that its trade union action would be resumed by 1 February following a decision taken unanimously during a special conference.  Meanwhile, during a media briefing, on Friday (19), at Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, Dr. Sujeewa Kumarasinghe, of the AMS, stated that Dr. Perera has submitted a letter requesting pre-retirement leave to the Ministry of Health due to ‘frustration’ caused by his arrest and subsequent remand. Dr. Kumarasinghe expressed concern that Dr. Perera’s premature retirement, with two more years remaining, would significantly inconvenience patients. He highlighted that the Southern Province’s only cancer surgery ward is located in the Karapitiya Hospital, where Krishantha Perera typically performs around six surgeries daily. Consequently, his absence would result in great injustice to patients on the waiting list. Dr. Dinesh Yapa, the GMOA branch union representative at the hospital, added that a certain group had also threatened the surgical oncologist. He expressed disappointment that the Police had not taken action regarding the complaint made in this connection."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/01/20/imf-urges-swift-agreements-for-sri-lankas-debt-sustainability/,IMF urges swift agreements for Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability,By Ishara Gamage,0,2024-01-19T20:32:00+00:00,"The timely conclusion of final agreements, with bilateral creditors and the successful resolution of issues, with private creditors, continue to be of utmost importance for Sri Lanka to reach debt sustainability,” senior Mission Chief at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Peter Breuer said on Friday (19). At a post-Sri Lanka visit press conference in Colombo, he said that the advancements made in Sri Lanka’s journey towards achieving debt sustainability may play a crucial role in the upcoming second review by the IMF scheduled for March. He said that Sri Lanka has successfully navigated through the two crucial stages in its very complicated debt restructuring process thus far. “The Sri Lanka debt restructuring process involves 10 different processes involving a complicated creditor landscape. The first two major blocks are already completed. It’s hard to focus on all these 10 things at the same time.” Even though it’s a complicated process, he said that Sri Lanka has made good progress. He also stressed the importance of enhancing good governance processes and accountability in Sri Lanka’s fiscal and monetary procedures to sustain the economic recovery process. According to him, the government plans to release its action plan in this regard in February. He emphasised the importance of maintaining the reform agenda for a comprehensive and sustainable economic recovery that benefits the people. During the press briefing, he also highlighted Sri Lanka’s progress in implementing the recently released IMF governance diagnosis report-related recommendations and he was optimistic about Sri Lanka’s commitment to strictly adhering to its 16 key recommendations. Responding to the questions about Sri Lanka’s taxation process, he said that it is essential for Sri Lanka to improve its revenue levels to finance essential government expenditures and bridge the income and expenditure gap. The IMF emphasises the importance of a progressive tax policy in Sri Lanka to ensure fair burden sharing and revenue consolidation. It proposes reinforcing tax policies by removing exemptions, restricting holidays, and combating tax evasion to ensure lasting reforms and instill confidence among crediters. According to the IMF in 2019, tax revenue in Sri Lanka amounted to approximately 11% of GDP, which dropped to seven per cent of GDP in 2022. This led to a gap of 13% of GDP by 2022, and the government had to borrow money to cover the difference. “The main challenge now is to get the number closer to its expenditure levels and crediters willing to lend the difference,” he said. In the year 2022, Sri Lanka’s revenue-to-GDP ratio stood at a mere 7%. The government aims to elevate this figure to 9% of GDP by 2023. “There are good signs that revenue collection has increased in the last quarter of the year, and this objective will be met,” he said. The objective of reaching 12% government revenue in 2024 and then 14% beyond that in 2025 is being achieved through significant reforms starting in 2022. These reforms include personal income tax and corporate income tax reforms that take time to take effect. The government has increased VAT this year and plans to introduce property tax in 2025, affecting those with higher incomes. “Despite the positive start of these reforms, the government still needs to raise more taxes, making it challenging,” he said.  The IMF plan also targets strengthening social safety to make sure that those who are vulnerable are looked after. It protects those who can be most affected by the IMF programme. After securing a USD 2.9 billion bailout loan agreement from the IMF, Sri Lanka is now on the road to recovering from its most severe financial crisis since independence."

Repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act should be a turning point for meaningful reform of Sri Lanka’s approach to its internal security, but this proposed law, instead risks perpetuating patterns of violations from the past,” spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told the biweekly press briefing in Geneva on Friday. The proposed law is substantially identical to previous drafts that were withdrawn after widespread criticism. It defines acts of ‘terrorism’ overly broadly, restricts the scope of judicial guarantees, especially with respect to challenging the lawfulness of detention orders, and curtails the ability of the Human Rights Commission to visit places of detention, among other problematic provisions. “If it is passed in its current form, the Bill would grant excessive powers to the executive to restrict rights, with limited or no safeguards against abuse of such powers. It would weaken the legal grounds needed for security forces to arrest individuals without warrants. It would also still permit lengthy pre-trial detention,” Shamdasani noted. “We urge the authorities to meaningfully engage with civil society and other stakeholders to substantively revise the Bill and bring it fully into line with Sri Lanka’s international human rights obligations,” she said.  (SRM)"

The committee questioned why both the PUCSL and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) are lagging behind in their efforts to digitise the system, especially when Parliament has called for a dispatch audit and accurate data.  The committee emphasised the need to minimise human intervention and viewed the failure to implement directives from Parliament as a sign of disrespect. Additionally, the committee expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of progress in digitisation, attributing this inaction to the presence of existing inefficiencies within the system. Highlighting the burden placed on consumers by such inefficiencies, the committee urged PUCSL officials to take a more assertive stance in addressing the situation and rectifying the issues related to digitisation. This discussion occurred during the meeting of the Sectoral Oversight Committee, on National Economic and Physical Plans, in Parliament last week, chaired by MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage.  The committee considered five Annual Reports, including the Annual Report of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for 2022, the Annual Performance Report of the Department of Treasury Operations for 2022, the Annual Report of the Ministry of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development for 2022, the Annual Report of the Lanka Sugar Company (Pvt) Ltd for 2017, and the Annual Report of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka for 2020.

At the end of the mission, Breuer issued the following statement: “The economic reform programme implemented by the Sri Lankan authorities, is yielding the first signs of recovery. Real GDP recorded positive growth of 1.6 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2023, the first expansion in six consecutive quarters. Shortages of essentials have eased and inflation remains contained. Gross international reserves increased by USD 2.5 billion during 2023, and preliminary data point to improved fiscal revenue collections during the fourth quarter of 2023. However, challenges remain as these improvements need to translate into improved living conditions for Sri Lanka’s people. “In this context, sustaining the reform momentum and ensuring timely implementation of all programme commitments are critical to rebuilding confidence and putting the recovery on a firm footing that will benefit all people. Swift progress towards the introduction of a progressive property tax is key to ensuring fair burden sharing while sustaining the revenue-based consolidation. “Tax policy measures need to be accompanied by strengthening tax administration, removing tax exemptions, and actively eliminating tax evasion to make the reforms more sustainable and to further build confidence among creditors to support Sri Lanka’s efforts to regain debt sustainability. “Building on the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s success in taming inflation, future monetary policy decisions should remain prudent with a focus on keeping inflation expectations well anchored. Against continued uncertainty, it remains important to continue rebuilding external buffers through strong reserve accumulation. Protecting the poor and the vulnerable through improved targeting and better coverage of cash transfers remains critical. “To safeguard the stability of the financial sector and bolster its capacity to support economic growth, the authorities need to urgently finalise amendments to the Banking Act in line with their commitment under the IMF-supported programme, implement the bank recapitalisation plan and strengthen the financial supervision and crisis management framework. “Following the publication of the IMF Governance Diagnostic report, it is now imperative for the authorities to adopt their own action plan for implementing the recommendations in the report beyond the priority commitments under the EFF arrangement. At the same time, ensuring an enabling environment for governance and transparency reforms to take place is key to bolstering public confidence and facilitating implementation of these important efforts. “The authorities have made commendable progress with putting debt on a path towards sustainability. The execution of the domestic debt restructuring was an important milestone. A swift completion of final agreements with official creditors and reaching a resolution with external private creditors remain critical. Progress in meeting key commitments under the IMF-supported program will be formally assessed in the context of the second review of the EFF arrangement alongside the forthcoming 2024 Article IV consultation assessing Sri Lanka’s economic health. “The IMF team held meetings with President and Finance Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakse, State Minister Shehan Semasinghe, Secretary to the Treasury K M Mahinda Siriwardana, Governor of Northern Province P.S.M.Charles, Governor of Eastern Province Senthil Thondaman, and other senior government and CBSL officials. The IMF team also met Parliamentarians, representatives from the private sector, civil society organisations, and development partners. “We would like to thank the authorities for the excellent collaboration during the mission, including during the mission’s visit to the Northern and Eastern Provinces. This visit enriched the mission team’s understanding of the challenges as well as the potential of Sri Lanka. We reaffirm our commitment to support Sri Lanka for a full economic recovery from the crisis.”"

A senior official from the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) mentioned that although the Government initially announced that all citizens over the age of 18 must obtain the TIN before 1 February, the programme has been postponed. He also noted that there have been allegations that the time provided to obtain the TIN is insufficient and various errors occur when applying through the online system on the Inland Revenue Department’s (IRD) website. State Minister of Finance, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, recently stated the necessity of implementing a system to obtain the TIN through divisional secretariats across the island, and a special officer will be appointed for that purpose. Despite the State Minister’s opinion, divisional secretariat staff are reportedly not supportive, citing their existing commitment to the Aswesuma welfare programme. While the Government initiated the TIN programme, trade unions within the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) have alleged that the department lacks sufficient employees to fulfil the related duties. J.T. Chandana, Secretary of the Union of Staff Officers of the IRD, said that approximately 25,000 people register daily for the TIN. As of now, more than two million people have registered, with around one million having registered before 1 January 2024. Deputy Commissioner General of the Inland Revenue Department Saman Shantha said after expanding the tax network, there is a possibility of reducing the tax percentage. He also outlined the possibility of extending the deadline even beyond 1 April."

An election has been called for 21 January, marking a significant development in the party’s leadership. The nominated candidates include MPs M.A. Sumanthiran, S. Sritharan, and former MP S. Yogeshwaran. With the nomination period closed, these three candidates have commenced their campaigns in the race to become the next leader of the ITAK. The current Leader of the ITAK is Mawai Senathirajah. He was unanimously elected as the party leader on 6 September 2014. ITAK MP Shanakiya Rasamanickam told Ceylon Today that the party will democratically introduce its new leader departing from the usual practice of unanimous decisions in leader selection. “For the first time, a secret vote will be conducted within the party to determine the next leader.” Rasamanickam emphasised that 300 members, possessing voting rights within the party, will play a crucial role by casting their votes during this historic leadership selection process. He further explained that the 300 voting members hail from the nine districts of the country, encompassing the north, the east, and the Colombo district. The distribution of voters in each district is proportional to its population, and these voters are democratically elected at the ward level. Each ward has a committee comprising a president, vice president, secretary, assistant secretary, treasurer, and in every Pradeshiya Sabha or divisional secretariat, a similar committee exists. Taking the Batticaloa District as an example, the MP said, where there are 10 Tamil divisional secretaries, each of these 10 has elected bodies. These elected bodies hold the eligibility to send their representation to the working committee. The working committee comprises 300 members, democratically elected at the grassroots level, based on this inclusive structure. Rasamanickam highlighted that this election process is highly democratic, and he asserted that no one can challenge its fairness. He expressed his opinion that after the election, the party can undergo a restructuring phase, fostering a unified approach to address and confront the various issues at hand. Discussing the possibility of an alliance with ITAK, Rasamanickam expressed his view that once the party election concludes, a central committee will be formed and they will deliberate many discussions on its future plans.  He clarified that the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is not obsolete and it still exists within the parliament, and ITAK is the main constituent of TNA. The future of alliances, according to him, depends on how the party approaches upcoming elections under the new leadership. Rasamanickam emphasised that it is premature to delve into these discussions now, but the election of the ITAK leader will open up opportunities to address the party’s future direction."

The appointment of a Hostage Negotiation Team is an internationally recognised norm in all International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Member States.  This national requirement has been addressed at the National Civil Aviation Security Committee (NCASC) meetings since 2016 and they are actively recruited at present. This requirement is an essential element in respect of resolving civil aviation incidents relating to aircraft hijacking and holding the passengers and crew hostage. The two international conventions are referred to as the Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft (1970) and the Tokyo Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft (1963) by which the international law has been formulated. Sri Lanka has ratified both Conventions. This national requirement has been addressed at the National Civil Aviation Security Committee (NCASC) meetings since 2016 and it is becoming a reality today, with senior Police Officers being appointed as the members of the Hostage Negotiation Team to be engaged in the civil aviation environment. These officers underwent hostage negotiation training offered by the United Nations Mission, USA in 2006."

He said that the successful completion of the ongoing debt restructuring program makes it compulsory for Japan to consider further assistance for Sri Lanka. Therefore, he emphasises that IMF endorsement of the ailing Sri Lankan economy is a crucial factor for building the internal and external debt holders’ confidence to support this critical debt restructuring programme. However, the Japanese diplomat said that they were expecting fair and equal treatment for all external creditors in Sri Lanka to get Japanese support for this debt restructuring programme. “In general, the IMF is globally accepted as the go-to doctor for economic crises; therefore, overcoming the current economic challenges in Sri Lanka is challenging without implementing an IMF-led programme,” he said. He made these remarks in response to queries from Ceylon Today, with an emphasis on anonymity, as the diplomat is not authorised to make public statements to the media. He also reiterated that Sri Lanka has already failed its home-grown remedies for this prevailing economic crisis; therefore, he stressed the importance of the continuity of the ongoing IMF country assistance programme without any obstacles, especially in this upcoming election period. He said that the Japanese minister of finance Shun’ichi Suzuki successfully concluded his two-day visits to Sri Lanka on Friday, and his government is fully committed to resuming Japanese-assisted procurement shortly. The main purpose of the Japanese finance minister’s visit was to declare the Japanese government’s commitments to Sri Lanka’s economic reform programme. The diplomat said that during this Japanese finance minister’s visit, he has assured continuous assistance for the construction of Terminal 2 of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. ‘He had already visited the BIA upon his arrival in Sri Lanka and committed to recommence this temporarily halted project due to Sri Lanka’s balance of payments crisis. He also showed his government’s willingness to restart the television digitisation project as agreed a few years ago, the diplomat said. Dependent on the successful completion of the ongoing debt restructuring program, Japan might extend its support to other areas and new projects, such as the light railway project. During his two-day stay in Sri Lanka, the Japanese minister of finance visited several Japanese-funded projects, such as Parliament, Jayawardena Centre, Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital, Colombo Dockyard and Lanka Nippon Biztec Institute in Maharagama. The visiting Japanese minister also met President Ranil Wickremesinghe and several other government ministers and officials."

During the recent committee meeting, it was disclosed that the CBSL is actively transitioning from the existing ‘Lanka Pay’ system to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), with the final stage anticipated to be reached by the end of the current year. The committee, comprising representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, the CBSL, Attorney General’s Department, Information and Communication Technology Agency, and scholars in the field, convened to deliberate on the implementation of an electronic money system in the financial market and the integration of blockchain technology. One crucial aspect discussed was the absence of a financial registry leading to an unregulated market in 45 per cent of the country. The committee extensively explored the introduction of a digital currency unit and an electronic payment platform utilising blockchain technology to address these issues. The Committee Chair stressed the importance of evaluating how blockchain technology could be integrated into the operations of key revenue collection agencies, including the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs and Sri Lanka Excise Department. The CBSL officials acknowledged the potential of incorporating blockchain technology into these activities and shared that the bank is already utilising the technology for investigations related to individual identification. They also highlighted the gradual nature of transitioning to blockchain technology due to associated costs. The committee emphasised the need to encourage electronic transactions through digital banking and pointed out the importance of adopting the ‘QR Code’ method in sectors vital to the Sri Lankan economy, such as transportation and electricity. Further, the committee instructed Central Bank officials to study and report on the digitisation processes implemented by India and Bangladesh in electronic transactions and digital currencies. The report is expected to outline methods, procedures, challenges, solutions and background information on these initiatives and is due to be submitted within the next two weeks."

The particular circular is still pending, he alleged.    Kumudesh accused the Health Ministry and Health Minister, Dr, Ramesh Pathirana of pushing the health services into an “unexpected strike.”   Meanwhile, President of Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association of Doctors (MCPA), Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa said the government could resolve the current crisis in the state health services by studying all Salary Commission reports that had been submitted regarding the disparities in the salaries and amending them to match the knowledge, skills, attitudes and qualifications of the health service employees.  Dr. Sanjeewa said it was justifiable for the remaining state health employees to become restless following the increase introduced to the Disturbance Availability and Transport (DAT) allowances of a single category as economic crisis was a vulnerable subject amongst all State health services.   He urged the government to resolve the crisis as soon as possible and not solve the issue from various  places like  solving a puzzle, taking to consideration the suffering of the innocent sick patients who have no other option but to seek free healthcare."

SACE, equivalent to Advanced Level, is a globally recognised pre-university programme that provides entry into the world’s top universities. Available in all subject streams, SACE is the official senior secondary school qualification of the South Australian government. With the introduction of SACE, Gateway now offers students two distinct pathways when they reach the examination classes – IGCSE and AL of the United Kingdom or SACE 1 and 2 of Australia. SACE Stage 1, equivalent to Ordinary Level or IGCSE, features a 100% assessment-based grading system, providing students with a continuous and thorough evaluation of their progress. Moving forward, SACE Stage 2, comparable to the Advanced Level, presents a well-balanced assessment structure, with 70% derived from continuous assessment based on research and assignments and 30% from a final written examination. This unique blend allows students to accumulate a significant weightage throughout the course at a flexible pace, mitigating the pressures of exam stress and rigid content adherence. Gateway College takes pride in its commitment to this new contemporary and modern approach to teaching, deviating from traditional learning which is based only on exams to focus on individual capabilities, critical thinking, and application skills. The very first intake of Gateway students joined SACE 2, immediately after completing their International GCSEs. The school takes pride in the fact that all the students of the first Batch have successfully completed the programme and achieved ATAR scores. Many students will be commencing their University careers as early as February 2024.  In a remarkable feat, 20% of Gateway students achieved an ATAR of 90.00 or higher, with an impressive 40% attaining an ATAR of 80.00 or higher. These percentages are significantly higher than the overall SACE International percentages. Impressed by these extraordinary achievements, the Hon. Minister of Education and the Chief Executive of SACE have awarded a Certification of Excellence to Gateway College, applauding the stellar performance of the Graduates of 2023. The second intake of Gateway students joined the programme at SACE 1 in January 2023.

The committee focused on reducing plastic and polythene waste, emphasising the need for a comprehensive ban on lunch sheets and addressing challenges in the recycling process. During the session, officials from the Ministry of Environment, Central Environment Authority (CEA), Sri Lanka Customs, and the Department of Trade and Investment Policy were summoned to provide insights. The committee highlighted the imbalance between imported PET plastic and its recycling capacity, noting that only 350 tons out of 1,200 tons of imported PET plastic are currently recycled in the country. Concerns were raised about the large-scale importation of plastic fibers (monofilament), hindering local recycling efforts. The committee directed the Ministry to collaborate with the Ministry of Finance in formulating legislation to impose appropriate taxes on such imports. Additionally, the committee urged the Ministry to address the ban on the import of plastic brooms and other single-use plastic products. The CEA emphasised the need for stricter regulations on items contributing to microplastic pollution in the country. The committee emphasised the environmental damage caused by lunch sheets and recommended a complete ban on its use. Manufacturers were given a six-month grace period to transition away from lunch sheets. Alternatives, including biodegradable paper, were proposed and discussed in the meeting. Further discussions revolved around amendments to the Environment Act, introducing QR codes for pet plastic bottles and incentivising consumers to recycle. The committee emphasised the urgency of implementing these proposals to enhance environmental protection in Sri Lanka. As a crucial step towards environmental sustainability, the Sectoral Oversight Committee instructed relevant authorities to issue a Gazette on the permanent ban of lunch sheets.

The three-member Commission, led by Justice Neil Iddawala, has been appointed to address the pressing need for robust action against corruption, Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) said in a statement.  “The backdrop to this development includes the 2022 massive people’s struggle (Aragalaya), which brought to light the public’s realisation that deep-rooted corruption, along with governance weaknesses, contributed to the crippling economic crisis in Sri Lanka. There is a prevailing disillusionment and frustration regarding the State’s commitment to addressing these issues sincerely. Civil society and international donor agencies, notably the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have emphasised that genuine progress in anti-corruption efforts is vital for the nation’s economic recovery. The IMF’s structural benchmarks for Sri Lanka, its Governance Diagnostic Assessment Report, and recommendations from the Civil Society Governance Diagnostic Report highlight the importance of empowering CIABOC.” The TISL stressed the urgency for CIABOC to regain public trust by targeting high-profile corruption cases and moving beyond minor infractions to pursue major offenders. TISL emphasised the need to establish accountability, especially in cases of grand corruption, to encourage whistleblowers and witnesses to come forward fearlessly. To make significant strides, CIABOC is urged to expedite public access to asset declarations, proactively investigate major corruption cases and expand its scope to address private sector bribery and sports-related corruption. Clear communication of its commitment and progress to the public is also deemed essential. Considering the magnitude of the widespread, systemic corruption problem in Sri Lanka, TISL called on the newly constituted Commission to provide visionary and fearless leadership in the fight against corruption. Additionally, TISL urged the Government to resource CIABOC with financial and functional independence and support it needs to be responsive to this decisive moment in the country’s trajectory toward recovery."

When the case was called up, Attorney-at-Law Darshana Ranmutuge, appearing for the two defendants informed Court, that his clients were ready to plead guilty to the charges filed against them. He added that his clients were also willing to pay suitable compensation, to the plaintiff. Senior State Counsel Lakshman Perera, appearing for the Attorney General, informed the Judge, that the two defendants having promised the plaintiff, to send him to Canada, had accompanied him to Malaysia, after which he had been left stranded in that country. He stated that the stranded plaintiff had been brought back to Colombo, by his parents, spending their own money. He therefore requested the Court, to mete out the sternest possible punishment, on two defendants. "

Furthermore, fake certificates are being utilised to fabricate details such as permanent employment, work experience, and institutional establishment. This deceit is especially prevalent in the procurement processes of various Government and statutory institutions. In response to this alarming trend, he emphasised the importance for both members and employers to safeguard documents related to EPF. Cautioning against sharing such sensitive information with third parties, he underscored the need for diligence in maintaining the integrity of these documents. Concerned about the authenticity of documents purportedly issued by the Central Bank’s Employees’ Provident Fund and submitted to foreign embassies and institutions, the senior officer advised individuals to contact the CBSL for clarification.  Additionally, he revealed that a substantial number of requests have already been submitted to the Fund for document verification, with a significant majority of these submissions proving to be fraudulent. "

The tragic case of a female Japanese Macaque, who had lived alone for approximately 15 years at the Dehiwala Zoo, came to a sad end on 9 March 2022.  The post-mortem revealed that the animal’s depression contributed to the exacerbation of cancer cells. The audit findings highlighted the severe impact of solitary living on the mental and physical well-being of animals. Ethical considerations within animal welfare strategies emphasise the necessity of providing an environment that allows for the natural behaviour of animals in the Zoo. In response to these findings, the Zoo management said the groundwork has been laid to participate in various international animal exchange programmes. The Zoo authorities expressed their commitment to addressing the issue, stating that they have already secured a partner for a black jaguar as part of their efforts to improve the well-being of the animals in their care.  "

According to the report, the EPF accounts earmarked for individuals employed in the Department of Labour and District Labour Offices are pooled into a common account. A senior officer from the National Audit Office expressed concern, stating that the money related to the EPF was placed in a public deposit account without proper crediting to personal accounts, constituting a clear violation of existing laws. The EPF has an estimated value of Rs 3.4 trillion.  Government sources suggest that the interest charged from its investment returns could be increased from the present 14 per cent to 30 per cent through the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act or reduce the interest paid to 9 per cent. "

This decision by the Minister pertains to the actions of Police Officers on duty at the security checkpoint near Methodist College, Kollupitiya in the night of 28 December 2023. The Police Officers reportedly subjected two young men to a thorough search, which included stripping and examination. The alleged incident unfolded during the inspection of a three-wheeler in which the two young men and a young woman were travelling. The suspicion arose due to the discovery of a pair of nail clippers in a bag, leading to an investigation under the assumption that they might be involved in drug-related activities, according to a post circulated on social media, written by the young man’s father. On the mentioned date, when the three individuals were en route to Chili’s Restaurant at Galle Face Mall using an app-based taxi service, they were stopped and checked at Kollupitiya Junction. The father of one of the young men involved recounted that the Police Officers initially checked the driver’s licence and registration papers before searching the two passengers and examining their bags. He further detailed that the Police officers accused them of drug use upon finding nail scissors in one of the young men’s bags. Subsequently, the Officers insisted on taking them behind the security cell for further inspection. The father claimed that, angered by the young men’s reluctance to remove their pants, the officers resorted to physically assaulting them. After the assault, the youths complied and removed their trousers, but the situation had escalated when the officers ordered them to remove their underwear as well. "

In his address, he highlighted the strides made in the power sector in 2023, addressing gaps in the existing Electricity Act and prioritising high-quality consumer service through a new Act that incorporates provisions related to consumer protection and regulation. Efforts have been made to increase the share of renewable energy in power generation, with a specific goal of achieving 70 per cent of electricity from renewable sources. The Ministry has been entrusted with the construction of solar panels, focusing on expediting projects below 10 megawatts. Notable projects in Mannar, Pooneryn and Hambantota have been incorporated into the generation plan. A key commitment highlighted by State Minister Anuruddha is the reduction of electricity bills through the production of renewable energy using hydro, solar and wind power. Data supporting the reduction has been submitted to the Public Utilities Commission, with expectations of a reduction either by the end of this month or in the first week of February. Additionally, the State Minister emphasised that new employee recruitment for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has been halted, and incentives and promotions for employees will be based on performance, while pensions and provident funds will remain unchanged.  "

Acknowledging the challenges faced by the nation, including the Easter Sunday terror attacks in 2019 and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the President addressed the audience, highlighting the grim economic situation in 2022, marked by a decline in growth of over 7 per cent. However, he emphasised his role in stabilising the economy in 2023, with positive growth observed in the later quarters. President Wickremesinghe expressed optimism for the coming years, projecting a positive growth of 2-3 per cent for the current year and a more substantial growth of about 5 per cent in 2025. He underscored the importance of these years as stabilising periods and unveiled a strategic shift in economic policies. Encouraging provinces to utilise the powers granted by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution for economic development, the President asserted that devolution should not only be a political concept but, an economic reality. He urged the provinces to take the initiative, drawing inspiration from examples in other nations, such as Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and France. President Wickremesinghe emphasised the need for laws that empower regions, allowing them to harness the powers within the 13th Amendment for development. A key aspect of the President’s economic plan involves abandoning the practice of printing more money and avoiding excessive borrowing from banks. He highlighted the need to focus on revenue generation, setting an initial target of 12 per cent of the GDP, with a long-term goal of reaching 15 per cent. The President introduced a paradigm shift in economic development, emphasising decentralisation and proposing the establishment of local and regional economies in various provinces. He envisioned distinct economies for the South, Central, North and North-Western provinces, each capitalising on its unique potential for agriculture, tourism and other sectors. President Wickremesinghe highlighted three key areas for economic growth – renewable energy, modernising agriculture and tourism. He emphasised the potential for renewable energy in the Northern Province, particularly in wind and solar power. Outlining plans to modernise agriculture on a global scale, the President introduced initiatives to boost tourism, including cruise tourism and themed trails focused on religious and cultural sites. Education emerged as a pivotal element in the President’s vision for economic growth, envisioning the Northern Province as a hub for education. He announced plans for substantial investment in technological research, AI and digital transformation to position Sri Lanka as a digital economy by 2025. President Wickremesinghe concluded by urging collaboration among civil society, businesses and MPs in the Northern Province to collectively drive economic development.

Elaborating on his verdict, Judge Patabendige stated that the defence had maintained from the outset, that such a quantity of heroin, had not been possessed by them. He then deemed that the Prosecution for their part had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants had possessed such a quantity of heroin. The Judge mentioned that when perusing the testimony put before him, there were reasonable doubts, as to whether there had been a genuine raid with regard to the quantity of heroin, seized from the two accused. Though the evidence in the trial, had mentioned that a raid had been conducted at Obeysekerapura, Rajagiriya on 22 November, five years ago and that plans were afoot to hand over the said stock of heroin to Tharaka’s mistress, the Judge pointed out, that it was rather questionable, as to why a seasoned team of PNB sleuths, that had taken part in the raid, had not sought the help of a WPC.

With a current focus on expanding the tax base, Nafeer shared crucial statistics highlighting the growth in registered taxpayers. In 2022, the number of registered companies increased from 73,444 to 81,909 by the end of November 2023. For individual taxpayers, the count rose significantly from 204,467 in 2022 to 500,196 by the end of November in the current year. Joint ventures also saw an increase from 13,776 to 15,579. The number of income tax registrations surged from 41,636 to 242,679, and VAT registrations rose from 10,604 to 13,546. Nafeer underscored the financial impact, noting that the income of the Inland Revenue Department, which was Rs 1,025 billion in 2019, decreased to Rs 500 billion in 2020. However, this year witnessed a substantial increase, reaching Rs 1,500 billion. This achievement was attributed to the broadening of the tax base and modifications to tax rates. In an effort to enhance tax compliance, Nafeer stressed that starting from January 2024, all individuals above the age of 18 must obtain a Tax Identification Number (TIN) from the Inland Revenue Department. He clarified that obtaining the registration number and opening tax files are distinct processes. While possessing a national identity card number is common, Nafeer highlighted the mandatory requirement for the Inland Revenue Department’s registration number (TIN Number).

A senior official from the National Authority for Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) revealed that if the Tobacco Taxation Formula had become law, the Government would have generated an additional income of Rs 45 billion in 2023. However, due to the formula not being enacted, the Government incurred a loss in potential income. With the implementation of this formula, the Government anticipated an increase in tax revenue from cigarettes, projecting an increase from Rs 92 billion in 2021 to Rs 125 billion by 2026. The formula was also expected to lead to a 1.1 per cent reduction in tobacco consumption and an annual government revenue increase of about 6 per cent. Regrettably, the official noted that the new taxation formula has not been passed into law, hindering the government’s ability to achieve the anticipated revenue growth. Consequently, the expected annual 6 per cent increase in State income remains unattained. The official urged that the Tobacco Tax Formula, developed by NATA in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and suspended by the former Finance Minister in 2021, should be legislated. He highlighted that each time cigarette prices were raised, individuals with close ties to influential legislators profited significantly. The official emphasised that the World Health Organisation provided financial support for the preparation of the TTF, a process that took a year and involved collaboration with experts from the University of Cape Town and WHO. In developing the TTF, factors such as the current cigarette price, the percentage of cigarette tax, the proposed price for the next year, the percentage of inflation, and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) were taken into consideration. The reports from the NATA highlight that the existing taxation structure for tobacco products in Sri Lanka is informal and complex, comprising a combination of various types of taxes."

The worldwide growth rate in the past year was just under one per cent. At the start of 2024, 4.3 births and two deaths are expected worldwide every second, according to the Census Bureau figures. The growth rate for the United States in the past year was 0.53%, about half the worldwide figure. The US added 1.7 million people and will have a population on New Year’s Day of 335.8 million people. If the current pace continues through the end of the decade, the 2020s could be the slowest-growing decade in US history, yielding a growth rate of less than four per cent over the 10-year-period from 2020 to 2030, said William Frey, a demographer at The Brookings Institution. The slowest-growing decade currently was in the aftermath of the Great Depression in the 1930s, when the growth rate was 7.3%. “Of course, growth may tick up a bit as we leave the pandemic years. But it would still be difficult to get to 7.3%,” Frey said. At the start of 2024, the United States is expected to experience one birth every nine seconds and one death every 9.5 seconds. However, immigration will keep the population from dropping. Net international migration is expected to add one person to the US population every 28.3 seconds. This combination of births, deaths and net international migration will increase the US population by one person every 24.2 seconds. (AP)"

The official highlighted that despite the government’s multiple announcements about removing essential consumer goods from VAT starting 1 January 2024, no specific order to this effect has been issued yet. Consequently, the prices of a domestic gas cylinder, a litre of octane 92 petrol and a litre of auto diesel may see higher values compared to the current prices. The official clarified that only crude oil, kerosene, aircraft fuel, shipping oil and furnace oil have been exempted from VAT. The Ministry of Finance has stated that the existing 15 per cent VAT for goods and services will be increased to 18 per cent from tomorrow (1 January) and goods and services not previously subjected to VAT will now fall under its purview. According to the list of VAT exemptions, published by the Inland Revenue Department, public passenger transport services are exempted from VAT, while taxi services are subject to VAT. Additionally, items such as wheat and wheat flour, infant milk powder, pharmaceutical products and drugs, agricultural seeds and plants, educational services, electricity, rice, rice flour and bread are among the goods exempted from VAT.

Sivakaran, expressed concerns on Friday (29) regarding the proposed Jaffna Drinking Water Supply Project, which plans to source water from Pali Aru in Mannar District.  He highlighted the potential adverse impact on the agriculture sector, emphasising the importance of ensuring the sustainability of water resources for local farmers. Sivakaran clarified that their intention is not to oppose the project, but to ensure that, in the long run, it does not negatively affect farmers who rely on the water of Pali Aru for agriculture.  A letter detailing the pros and cons of the proposed project has been sent to Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Minister Jeevan Thondaman. There is apprehension among the rural population in the region about whether the drinking water supply project might compromise their agricultural activities, which are crucial for their livelihoods. Sivakaran expressed concern about the lack of discussion with sector-wise officials, relevant departments and farmers engaged in paddy and crop cultivation using Pali Aru reservoir water. According to Sivakaran, the project plan provided by the Ministry of Water Supply indicates that the Pali Aru reservoir supplies water for 358 hectares of cultivable lands in both the Maha and Yala seasons. However, he noted that the actual area under cultivation is 513 hectares during both seasons under this scheme. Sivakaran highlighted challenges during the Yala Season, where eight small tanks in the district, reliant on Pali Aru reservoir water, need to be filled seven to nine times annually. This process becomes complicated during the dry season when balancing water release for agriculture and meeting Jaffna’s drinking water needs becomes challenging. He also pointed out a significant issue faced during the dry season in releasing water to Kadambankulam and Karayankannadi farmers from the Pali Aru reservoir. Sivakaran warned that if the stretch of agricultural lands under the Pali Aru scheme is increased to 1,000 acres, this problem could escalate further.  "

The Ambassador highlighted that comprehensive information concerning the Sri Lankan network, involved in enticing individuals to seek employment overseas through illegal job syndicates, has been shared with the National Investigation Bureau (NIB) and its affiliated branches, including the CID and the National Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force under the Defence Ministry. He asserted that some of the “workers” expressed a desire to remain and continue working there. He mentioned instances where individuals wished for their wives to join them, acknowledging the complex circumstances possibly influencing these decisions, which he refrained from accepting outright. He emphasised that while some opted to work willingly, others faced severe consequences, enduring torture and distress during their captivity in the ethnic rebel-controlled territory of Myawaddy. He elaborated on the situation, stating, “the reality is that some wanted to stay and work,” recounting an incident where a “worker” initially expressed a wish to return to Sri Lanka but later changed his mind, opting to stay and continue working after a few days. Myawaddy Township is known to be under control of the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), one of many ethnic groups battling against the Burmese Junta who seized power in a coup on 1 February 2021. The Sri Lankans are held in unfamiliar and uncertain location after being lured into unfamiliar cybercrimes operations for financial gains. They were lured to work as data entry operators which many are of that profession but end up as cybercriminals supporting the illegal network. Reports indicate this location, situated between Thailand and Myanmar, appears on Google Earth as a zone where migrant workers seem trapped—a designated ‘cybercriminal area’.   Ambassador Bandara stated that through these negotiations, approximately 32 individuals were successfully released, and they intend to continue similar talks with the military government of Myanmar. He indicated having already communicated with the Home Minister and Foreign Minister, while Foreign Minister Ali Sabry had initiated discussions and was soon planning a telephone discussion with Myanmar’s leadership to facilitate the release.  The Ambassador emphasised the challenges, citing a personal incident where his vehicle was detained, and the driver was imprisoned for over a week before being released by the rebel groups in Myawaddy.  Additionally, he emphasised the Sri Lankan government’s efforts to involve all BIMSTEC leaders in securing the release of their captive citizens, utilising the BIMSTEC platform. He noted that many individuals left Sri Lanka without involving the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment. When the initial 32 were released, announcements were made advising Sri Lankans not to travel to countries not approved by the government. He expressed concern over Sri Lankans disregarding these laws, leading them into trouble. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/23/sri-lankans-held-captive-by-chinese-and-myanmar-cyber-criminals/,Sri Lankans held captive by Chinese and Myanmar Cyber Criminals,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2023-12-22T20:36:00+00:00,"In the last two years, the man-made severe economic and financial crisis in Sri Lanka has driven individuals, from various walks of life, to seek an escape from the island. The overwhelming financial burden hindered their ability to support their families, triggering a rush to depart, causing extensive queues at passport offices. Regrettably, a faction that hastily departed are stranded in Myawaddy, Southeastern Myanmar, an area under ethnic armed rebel control, encountering scary, distressing and uncertain situations that cast a shadow over their lives. While the current Sri Lankan Government recently commemorated International Migrants’ Day with series of speeches, highlighting the challenges faced by migrant workers and pledging fair treatment, transparency, and assistance with visas and passport acquisition, the stark contrast is that many who embarked on perilous journeys—some arriving in Indonesia, others landing on Diego Garcia islands, migrant workers in the middle East and elsewhere, find themselves abandoned, left to their fate.  In the latest news that is doing its rounds in Sri Lanka is about the 60 workers in Myanmar held captive in an unfamiliar and uncertain location after being lured into unfamiliar cybercrimes operations for financial gains. They were lured to work as data entry operators which many are of that profession but end up as cybercriminals supporting the network. What they’ve been coerced into is manipulating these individuals to engage in online financial transactions. One stranded man lamented how the economic situation drove them to leave the country without a second thought, mentioning that his 22-year-old daughter had just finished her A/Ls and needed money for her higher education. Reports indicate this location, situated between Thailand and Myanmar, appears on Google Earth as a zone where migrant workers seem trapped—a designated ‘cybercriminal area.’ While Myanmar is under military rule, various terrorist activities also operate in different regions, and this cybercriminal area is suspected to be governed by a specific terrorist group that has its own territories in Myamar. It’s believed that between 60 to 100 Sri Lankans are trapped there, drawn in by advertisements seeking data entry operators for work in Thailand. However, they were later transferred to this cybercriminal area in Myanmar. The local operators in Sri Lanka are supposed to be from Gampaha. The stranded individuals shared that their dire country’s situation led them to seek an escape, but some exploited their vulnerability, leading them to what feels like a slave camp. They’re coerced into assuming false identities, connecting with people in Europe and America, feigning romantic relationships, and enticing them to deposit funds—committing cyber financial crimes. Non-compliance results in unimaginable punishment, including handcuffing, tying to chairs, electric shock treatment, hanging, and incarceration in dark rooms with minimal food until they agree to work for them for several hours. When their ‘contracts’ end, their earnings are plundered, and they are resold to another party for USD 8,000 one of the captives said. This was aired on the local television. Supervised by Chinese nationals, many contacted the Sri Lankan embassy in Myanmar without results. From October 2022 to 2023, around 32 individuals were reportedly held captive, with an additional 56 mentioned in communications with the Myanmar Government. A distressed woman detailed how young individuals are lured, tortured and forced into dark rooms, subjected to water immersion, and threatened with hanging if they fail to find clients online. She had met a Chinese woman who lured her to Myanmar citing better salary as data entry operator. She believed her and had left for Yangoon directly from Dubai and from there she was taken to the rebel-controlled area. She said she is held and given electric shocks if she does not work. She also pointed out that she is a graduate and mother of two children and she went to Dubai during crisis times.  She’s forced into deceitful identities and romantic conversations and endures torture if unable to secure clients. Despite her education, she’s trapped in these atrocious circumstances, and she pleaded for assistance to return to Sri Lanka. If she reveals her identity she can be killed, she lamented on the video. The Sri Lankan Government has stated that it will come up with an immediate resolution to the issue of those held captive in Myanmar. This unexpected situation has left Sri Lankans in a slave-like camp, far from home, their tales of tragedy and the scary situation they are indeed shocking.   Ethnic rebel groups of Myanmar Myawaddy Township is known to be under control of the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), one of many ethnic groups battling against the Burmese Junta who seized power in a coup on 1 February 2021. At the time of Burmese independence from the British in 1948, there was considerable tension between the Karen community and the Burmese majority. Some Karens sought independence while others attempted co-existence within Burma.   It is not feasible to work on the release of Sri Lankans immediately from the rebel groups. Sri Lankans, enticed to work in Thailand, were subsequently transported to Myawaddy, a territory controlled by the rebel military.  The other rebel group is the Kachin Independence Army which was founded in the 1960s. The WA State Army and Kachin Independence Army are longstanding rebel factions tracing their origins to the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Both groups have been active and hold significant influence as insurgent forces within their respective regions. Established in 1961, the Kachin Independence Army operates as the non-State armed branch of the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO), representing the political interests of ethnic Kachins in Northern Myanmar. The Kachins, a collective of six tribes, inhabit territories spanning China’s Yunnan, Northeast India, and Kachin State in Myanmar. The Kachin Independence Army sustains itself through regional taxes and trade in valuable resources like jade, timber, and gold. Their arsenal comprises AK-47s, locally-manufactured rifles like the KA series, and some artillery. Headquartered in Laiza, southern Kachin State, the Kachin Independence Army strategically operates near the Chinese border. Conversely, the United Wa State Army, commonly abbreviated as the UWSA or the UWS Army, operates as the armed branch of the United Wa State Party (UWSP), effectively governing the Wa State, officially recognised as the Wa Self-Administered Division, within Myanmar. This ethnic minority army is estimated to comprise around 20,000 Wa soldiers, under the leadership of Bao Youxiang. Originating after the disintegration of the armed wing of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) in 1989, the UWSA emerged as a well-equipped military force. Human trafficking and Sri Lankans lured for cybercrimes Information suggests that a human trafficking network has been established in Sri Lanka due to the political and financial turmoil, prompting people to seek ways to leave the country. It is suspected that between 60 to 100 or more Sri Lankans may be stranded in this network. A television station aired distressing voice messages and videos from these individuals, portraying them as virtual slaves in their current situation. One person revealed being tricked into a data entry job, only to be coerced into creating fake identities. These identities are used to engage affluent individuals in the West in romantic conversations, purportedly to search for their supposed partners. However, these individuals have ended up in Myawaddy, located approximately 450km from Yangon, the capital of Myanmar. This area is under the control of a paramilitary group labelled as rebel factions by the Myanmar Junta.  Myawaddy spans around 1500 square kilometres and is encompassed by a city controlled by this rebel group. Despite having its own hospitals, schools, and shopping malls, the area remains outside the jurisdiction of the Myanmar government. It’s walled with a city enclosed within. Myawaddy is a township in southeastern Myanmar, in Kayin State, close to the border with Thailand. Separated from the Thai border town of Mae Sot by the Moei River, the town is the most important trading point between Myanmar and Thailand. According to Ceylon Today, there might be over 100 Sri Lankans stranded, along with a significant number of migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Malaysia. Disturbingly, various cybercrime agencies are involved in this operation. Allegations suggest that two individuals from Gampaha, Sri Lanka, are linked to the trafficking of Sri Lankans as data operators to Thailand. From there, these individuals are transferred across the border to Myanmar, specifically to the rebel-held area known as Myawaddy. Similarly, another group of cybercriminals in Dubai, predominantly run by Chinese operators, collaborates directly with rebel groups to transport Sri Lankans and individuals from other countries via airlines to Yangon. Reportedly, the recruiting agency identified is Youku Gems Company Ltd, active in Thailand, while an underworld entity called Scandemit facilitates the transit of migrant workers from Thailand to Myanmar. Allegedly, the Myanmar junta government collaborates covertly with the paramilitary operating in Myawadi. Sources indicate that Thailand serves as the main hub for these scammers. Operating from the southern side of Myanmar, they expand their activities into Laos, Thailand, and China. Myawaddy stands out as a hub for these Chinese scammers, orchestrating various illicit activities through cyber operations. They are involved in human and drug trafficking, running illegal casinos, engaging in organ trade, hacking bank accounts, perpetrating credit card scams and even managing brothels—all orchestrated through their cyber-based activities. They also issue agreement letters that look authentic.  Chinese cybercriminals One of the masterminds behind the scam, Ming Xue Chang of Chinese origin, tragically died by suicide in 26 July  2023, just as authorities were closing in for his arrest. Following this, his son-in-law, Bi Huijun, has released a video urging the Chinese government to pay ransom. Meanwhile, another operation led by an associate is reportedly ongoing. The Chinese government has put out a reward of USD 70,000 for information leading to the capture of approximately 1,000 wanted individuals involved in scams, posting their images along the Chinese border. Amidst the crisis between 2000 and 2022, a significant number of Sri Lankans sought refuge by leaving the country. The plight of Sri Lankans stranded in Myawaddy, Myanmar, has persisted for three to four years. Additionally, an Indian newspaper reported that over 300 Indians, including around 60 from Tamil Nadu, have been held captive by the rebel group. Sri Lanka prides itself on an overseas worker deployment system, yet it falls short due to the prevalence of scandalous and fraudulent job agencies within the country. These fraudulent practices have expanded beyond borders, reaching Dubai and various nations through a systematic network of operations that challenges governance overwhelmed by pressing issues. While Western nations maintain caution, developing countries like India, Malaysia, and Bangladesh also grapple with similar scams. Sri Lanka’s foreign policies should prioritise migrant workers  Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, while engaging in bilateral discussions with Dubai and several other Middle Eastern nations, should emphasise the urgency of addressing border crossings as a top priority. It’s crucial to highlight that many domestic workers unknowingly cross borders into other Middle Eastern countries. Bilateral talks must encompass not just financial and developmental agendas for Sri Lanka and boosting their images in the countries they visit, but also focus on ensuring the welfare of migrant workers and addressing the negligence of some host countries towards migrant workers.  Bilateral ties among nations are typically instrumental in monitoring and addressing such operations. During the Myanmar Junta’s rise to power, Sri Lanka engaged in bilateral talks with them. However, questions arise about the absence of monitoring when a Sri Lankan migrant worker, based in Dubai, heads to Myanmar. This unchecked movement of migrant workers across borders necessitates stringent monitoring and control measures.  As of China’s involvement in this matter, numerous unanswered questions persist, especially considering their apparent inaction towards addressing cybercrimes within their own territories. If Sri Lanka doesn’t implement stringent monitoring measures for Chinese nationals entering the country, the infiltration of these cyber criminals from China could potentially pose a significant issue in the years to come. Controlling borders is crucial in combating rising human trafficking globally and Sri Lanka currently falls short in this area. Some are working on their own will in rebel controlled area – SL Ambassador The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Myanmar, Janaka Priyantha Bandara, conveyed to Ceylon Today that Sri Lankans are currently held in a rebel-controlled territory, and immediate release is not feasible. Instead, they are gradually engaging in discussions to negotiate with both the government of Myanmar and the rebel group, aiming to progress towards their release. Ambassador Bandara stated that through these negotiations, approximately 32 individuals were successfully released and they intend to continue similar talks with the military government. He indicated having already communicated with the Home Minister and Foreign Minister, while Foreign Minister Ali Sabry had initiated discussions and was soon planning a telephone discussion with Myanmar’s leadership to facilitate the release. However, the rebel regime has not yet addressed the issue of releasing the Sri Lankans, despite being informed.  The Ambassador highlighted that other governments like India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan are also in discussions to secure the release of their citizens. He emphasised the challenges, citing a personal incident where his vehicle was detained, and the driver was imprisoned for over a week before being released by the rebel groups in Myawaddy. He mentioned discovering that some Sri Lankans had gone to Myanmar on their “own will.” When questioned about voluntarily going to a rebel-controlled territory, he acknowledged that they were enticed to go there. However, he highlighted the reality that some individuals in Myawaddy initially expressed a desire to return to Sri Lanka but later changed their stance, claiming contentment with their current work situation. According to him, some are earning well in that territory. Additionally, he emphasised the Sri Lankan Government’s efforts to involve all BIMSTEC leaders in securing the release of their captive citizens, utilising the BIMSTEC platform. He noted that many individuals left Sri Lanka without involving the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment. When the initial 32 were released, announcements were made advising Sri Lankans not to travel to countries not approved by the government. He expressed concern over Sri Lankans disregarding these laws and falling into trouble. He admitted that while some opt to remain and work in the rebel-controlled area, others face torture. Those who do not comply with the demands of scammers reportedly endure ill-treatment and torture."

In response to a question about this issue on Friday (22), Dr. Jeewandara said this has left Sri Lanka indecisive about its current situation. He emphasised that the JN.1 subvariant might already be in the community, given the increased cases of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) observed in Sri Lanka. Dr. Jeewandara highlighted a situation in Kochi, India, where 30 per cent of patients with ILI tested positive for Covid within 24 hours, specifically due to the Omicron subvariant. He stressed that Covid is not as simple as a common cold, as it can lead to severe illness, including an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and mental health issues. Despite the challenges, Dr. Jeewandara noted that Sri Lanka’s health system has successfully managed previous waves and is prepared for a potential influx of JN.1 cases. He recommended the use of masks, especially for the elderly or those with weakened immunity due to comorbidities, in poorly ventilated, closed or crowded environments. Common symptoms to watch for include fever, cough, loss of smell and taste, persistent high fever, breathing difficulties, fatigue, loss of appetite and nausea. Dr. Jeewandara reassured the public that Covid vaccines are still effective, though individuals at risk may require a booster dose. Meanwhile, President of the Academy of Health Professionals (AHP), Ravi Kumudesh, urged health authorities to provide Covid-19 testing facilities in Outpatient Departments (OPDs) of State-run hospitals. He expressed concern that the JN.1 subvariant might be present in the country, especially since it has been identified in South India. Kumudesh criticised the lack of Covid testing in State lab facilities, emphasising the need for comprehensive screening and testing for variants to prevent potential outbreaks."

Additionally, the Ministry has noted instances of unnecessary planned power interruptions for maintenance over the weekends, incurring significant overtime payments for the CEB. The decision to suspend such interruptions aims to optimise operational efficiency and reduce unnecessary costs, Wijesekara said. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/23/airline-pilot-denied-a320-type-rating-transfer/,Airline pilot denied A320 Type Rating transfer,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2023-12-22T20:32:00+00:00,"A Sri Lankan commercial pilot who served overseas asserted that the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) declined his request for an A320 aircraft type rating, despite holding an American licence with an A320 type rating and having flown commercial aircraft in the Far East. When Ceylon Today contacted the CAASL, Director General P.A. Jayakantha clarified that any foreign pilot “must” undergo exams and a simulator test to comply with international standards. The pilot, M. Kanagasabai, contended that this wasn’t a requirement and said the exams run for a year and involve some 14 different papers.  Pointing at FCL.725 that explains the requirements for the issue of class and type rating in clause (e), he said he is not required to sit for an exam. Kanagasabai aimed to join the national carrier during a pilot shortage in Sri Lanka. Yet, he refused to take the exams and a practical A320 simulator test, citing that it wasn’t mandated by the internationally recognised implementing standard IS-072 published by the CAASL which is in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards. He has written to many authorities and politicians about his case and even forwarded his grievances to the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Transport and Civil Aviation.  The pilot highlighted the non-transferability of his American A320 type rating to the Sri Lankan commercial pilot licence, attributing it to the failure to interpret implementing standard number IS-072. Jayakantha mentioned two other candidates who sought to transfer their international type ratings to the Sri Lankan licence. They complied with the exams and simulator requirements and are now employed. The CAASL Director General further stated that he had contacted the ICAO, the EU aviation body and the Cooperative Development of Operational Safety and Continuing Airworthiness Programme (COSCAP) regarding issuing licences to this particular pilot, receiving “negative responses”. Jayakantha attempted to assist the pilot in obtaining the type rating by recommending the exams, but the pilot “declined,” he said.  The DG also said the pilot did not attend a meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Aviation chaired by the Secretary last week. However, Kanagasabai appears to have emailed the Secretary of the Aviation Ministry that he was “not informed” about last week’s appointment for the discussion. “The issuance of such licences pertains to passenger safety, and I cannot compromise on lives,” emphasised the Director General of CAASL. The candidate, a member of the Aircraft Owners’ and Operators’ Association (AOAOA), is said to have requested the technical expertise of an expert of the association, who had very clearly informed the AOAOA committee that the CAASL has confused the interpretation of licencing with operators’ requirements. A type rating is an endorsement on a pilot’s licence, granting specific privileges to fly a particular type of jet aircraft. It involves a rigorous training programme established by airlines and approved training organisations. Specifically, a type rating is mandatory for operating complex jet aircraft like the Airbus A320. Kanagasabai invested around USD 20,000 on an A320 Type Rating course at Aerostar – USA, an internationally recognised training organisation. However, the CAASL hasn’t reached a decision on transferring the type rating to his Sri Lankan A320 type rating, which he has been requesting for the last 12 months.  He plans to join SriLankan or FitsAir operations, but he alleged that the CAASL has not been supportive enough. The is despite possessing over 300 hours of flying experience on the Airbus A320, obtained while working with an airline in the Far East.  The CAASL follows implementing standards like IS-072, compliant with ICAO annexes, to issue type ratings for Sri Lankan commercial pilot licences. Kanagasabai applied for this transfer in January 2023, but hasn’t received a response, with neither the present Director General nor the Chairman responding to the Secretary’s queries."

There are only 498 employees which is 18.88 per cent of the total number of employees that haven’t received overtime payments. The audit report, which is an annexure of the Annual Report of CPSTL for the year 2021, was presented to Parliament on 12 December.  The audit report highlighted those disbursing millions of rupees in overtime payments to a large number of employees when there is no genuine need for overtime work at the CPSTL represents a significant economic loss to the entity.  The audit report also noted that employees were encouraged to take more loans without assessing their ability to repay them. Further, overtime work was seemingly used as a basis for facilitating staff loans granted to employees. Further, the CPSTL has provided several loan facilities to its employees such as vehicle loans, housing loans, disaster loans, etc. The total value of the debt balance amounted to a massive Rs 3.359 billion in 2021.  Even with that, it was revealed the CPSTL has no proper financial principle to manage the employees’ loans. Also, it hasn’t obtained any kind of professional advice, externally or internally with regard to the matter.  As a result of this colossal debt balance, the CPSTL has lacked funds for more important things such as developing infrastructure for fuel distribution.

They collectively affirmed their decision not to sell eggs in the retail market for less than Rs 55. Further, the egg producers have requested the minister not to pressure them to lower egg prices below Rs 45 until the end of Christmas, assuring that prices would naturally decrease after 20 December. However, the Minister stressed that maintaining the egg selling price at Rs 55 was not sustainable. Meanwhile, the rise in local egg prices is attributed to the accumulation and stockpiling of eggs for use in bakery and biscuit production aimed at meeting the demands of the Christmas season, the All-Island Egg Producers’ Association (AIEPA) said.  Treasurer of AIEPA, Wijeya Alwis, said approximately 20 per cent of chickens from each poultry farm have perished due to the ongoing rainy weather, resulting in a reduction in egg production. According to Alwis, both large-scale and small-scale bakeries and biscuit companies have strategically increased their egg reserves in anticipation of ramping up production during the holiday season.  He predicted that the present price, which is approximately Rs 65 in the market, will be reduced to around Rs 40 after the festive season.

Colombo District Judge K.V.M.P. De Silva issued this order on Friday (15).  The complaint, filed by S.A. Disna Shirani of Dalwapitiya Road, Mahara, Kadawatha, details the incident that occurred around 6 November 2021. According to the complaint, her husband had left the house for an essential purpose after bringing home a 12.5 kg gas cylinder from the defendant company, Litro Gas. Shortly after her husband’s departure, the cylinder exploded, resulting in severe burns and injuries to her. As a result, she received treatment at the National Hospital Colombo, including undergoing surgery. The complaint further said, that before the accident, Shirani ran a food stall to earn an income for the family and her husband was engaged in business. However, due to the accident, they were unable to continue these activities, leading to a severe economic crisis for the family. The complaint highlighted that despite the economic hardships suffered by the family, Litro Gas Company has not provided any compensation. Shirani’s husband submitted complaints to various authorities, including the Peliyagoda Police Station, the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA), the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) and the Committee on Public Petitions of Sri Lanka Parliament.  The complaint said the defendant company did not respond to a Letter of Demand (LoD) sent by Shirani’s lawyer, Jayamudita Jayasuriya, on 20 October, requesting compensation within 14 days for the economic losses suffered by the family. Shirani contended that the main cause of the accident was the increase in pressure in the cylinder due to a high percentage of propane in the gas tank samples distributed by Litro Gas Company at the time of the incident. The explosion resulted in burn injuries, paralysis of body parts, hearing and eye diseases and subsequent surgeries for Shirani. The complaint emphasised the enduring physical and mental pain suffered by her due to the incident. By Hansi Nanayakkara "

A judge has ruled in his favour on almost half of the sample of 33 stories used in his claims of phone hacking and other methods. A High Court ruling found evidence of “widespread and habitual” use of phone hacking at the Mirror newspapers. Prince Harry described it as a “great day for truth” and accountability. He was awarded £140,600 in damages and in a statement read out on the Duke of Sussex’s behalf outside the High Court, his lawyer David Sherborne called the ruling “vindicating and affirming”. “This case is not just about hacking – it is about a systemic practice of unlawful and appalling behaviour, followed by cover ups and destruction of evidence, the shocking scale of which can only be revealed through these proceedings,” he said. “I’ve been told that slaying dragons will get you burned. But in light of today’s victory and the importance of doing what is needed for a free and honest press – it’s a worthwhile price to pay,” Prince Harry’s statement said. He also called on the police and prosecuting authorities to “investigate bringing charges against the company and those who have broken the law”. The stakes have also been high for the Mirror newspapers – the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People – with estimates that £100m has already been spent on damages and legal costs over previous hacking cases. Mr Justice Fancourt ruled that unlawful information gathering had been “widespread” at all three of the Mirror titles and had become “habitual”. Among the headlines of articles on which Prince Harry won his claims was “Harry is a Chelsy fan” – about his relationship with Chelsy Davy – and “Davy stated” about the couple arguing. Prince Harry has complained about his personal relationships being targeted and he also won his claim over the story “Harry’s date with Gladiators star”, which was about him visiting television presenter Caroline Flack. In response a Mirror Group Newspapers spokeswoman said: “We welcome today’s judgment that gives the business the necessary clarity to move forward from events that took place many years ago. “Where historical wrongdoing took place, we apologise unreservedly, have taken full responsibility and paid appropriate compensation.” The landmark ruling follows Prince Harry’s appearance at the High Court in June, where he became the first senior royal of modern times to give such extensive evidence in court in person. Over two days, he was grilled about his claims that the group’s newspapers had published many stories about him, over several years, based on phone hacking and other unlawful ways of obtaining information. In his findings, Mr Justice Fancourt concluded that Prince Harry had faced phone hacking – although to “a modest extent” – and other forms of dishonest gathering of information. (BBC)  "

The Government said that the Commission aims to ensure and strengthen national unity, peace, the rule of law, coexistence, equality, tolerance, respect for diversity and reconciliation among the people of Sri Lanka. This commitment extends to preventing any recurrence of disharmony and future conflicts between the multi-ethnic and diverse communities. The Commission is expected to review, consider and facilitate the implementation of recommendations made by past Commissions related to Sri Lanka’s post-conflict reconciliation efforts, including the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).

The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to ensuring that the proposed independent Commission acts impartially, free from any political influence. With a victim-centric ethos, the proposed Commission will be a sanctuary for voices to be heard, pain to be acknowledged and dignity to be reclaimed, providing a closure to victims and paving the path for national unity and social cohesion. Pending the enactment of the proposed new law, the Government has initiated the establishment of an interim body, the Interim Secretariat for Truth and Reconciliation Mechanism (ISTRM). The ISTRM is working to build the necessary legal and policy framework, operational procedures and guidelines for the Commission. The objective of the ISTRM is to lay the foundation for a home-grown solution for truth, reconciliation and national unity. The ISTRM is currently engaging with the public and stakeholders to ensure the Commission is built with their participation and consultation, shaping this transformative mechanism and ultimately paving the way for sustainable peace and national unity.

This sum is part of the USD 201.6 million loan granted by the National Savings Bank in 2013 for the construction of the teaching hospital. A senior official at the KDU revealed that 90 items of medical equipment, acquired at a cost of Rs 85 million, between 2017 and 2022, along with a stock of medical equipment purchased for Rs 77 million are currently unused and in the warehouse.  Additionally, Ward No. 07 of the teaching hospital, responsible for inpatient medical treatment, has been closed since May 2022. Fifty-two items of medical equipment, worth 14 million rupees, in this ward have been lying idle. Intensive care units 02, 03, and 04 have also been shut down, with 145 items valued at Rs 198 million remaining idle for over a year.  Consequently, the total value of idle assets at the teaching hospital under the KDU amounted to Rs 374 million. Meanwhile, a senior official Ministry of Defence highlighted that the KDU Teaching Hospital was established on a 21.5815 hectare land belonging to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) in the Kesbewa Divisional Secretariat Division and the legal rights to that land have not been properly transferred to the universities. As a result, despite more than six years passing since the completion of the teaching hospital, the legal process of acquiring the necessary land remains incomplete.  The buildings on the land are valued at Rs 45.38 billion and an expenditure of Rs 1.2 billion has been incurred solely for the development of the land. In 2018, a pneumatic tube system was installed during the construction of the KDU Teaching Hospital, costing USD 530,000, intended for transporting laboratory test materials and reports across 56 departments.  However, as of 2022, only 47 of the 56 sectors have utilised the system and for 24 sectors, the transportation of laboratory test materials and reports has been limited. Furthermore, a tripartite agreement was signed on 24 January 2022, involving the Defence Ministry Secretary, Amrita Technologies, and Thinkcube Systems Company to establish a health information management system at the teaching hospital at a cost of one million USD. Despite an expected completion date of 24 February 2023, an audit report indicates that the system’s establishment has not been finalised. The Director of the hospital clarified to Ceylon Today that it was not the KDU Teaching Hospital that received the USD 201.6 million loan from the National Savings Bank for construction, but rather the KDU university itself.  He confirmed that the pneumatic tube system established in 2018 for transporting laboratory materials and reports, is currently operational.  Furthermore, he mentioned that the ongoing work regarding the ownership of the land where the teaching hospital is located had been completed in the current year.

According to the report numbered PAS/B/CSCL/01/22/61, the cumulative loss as of 31 March 2022, reached Rs. 9.32 billion. The net assets of the company were in the negative value of Rs 7.91 billion by 31 March 2022. The Auditor General’s report highlighted a significant increase in both the loss for the year and the negative net asset balance, with a surge of 608.87% and 287.65%, respectively, compared to the preceding year.  The primary reason for the loss in the reviewed year was the exchange loss of Rs. 6.08 billion incurred from converting the loan balance which was in USD to LKR as of 31 March 2022. Despite mitigating measures were presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 30 July 2021, no action was taken to implement those measures. To address issues related to loss-making government owned enterprises (SoEs), the Cabinet approved the establishment of a ‘State-Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit’ on 5 September 2022.  The unit, under the Ministry of Finance, aims to introduce an alternative mechanism for the efficient operation of government-owned businesses, given their unsatisfactory performance and financial strain on the General Treasury. The government plans to draft a new law for the restructuring of SoEs, with submission to Parliament scheduled for early January 2024. Approximately 130 SoEs have been identified, with 15 facing possible liquidation and 85 considered for future restructuring without government control. The government intends to restructure these entities in accordance with the new law once it is passed by Parliament in early 2024. BY Mithun Jayawardhana"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/09/joint-declaration-between-gtf-and-sl-buddhist-delegation-unveiled/,Joint Declaration between GTF and SL Buddhist delegation unveiled,Author not found,0,2023-12-08T20:33:00+00:00," President Ranil Wickremesinghe engaged in discussions with a diverse delegation comprising representatives from the Global Tamil Forum (GTF), one of the oldest international Tamil organisations based in the UK for the Tamil cause and Buddhist monks on Friday (8).  During the meeting, the GTF presented a ‘Joint Himalayan Declaration’ formally to President Wickremesinghe. The GTF re-established its engagement following its ties with previous governments being severed when it was proscribed in 2020 during the presidency of Gotabaya Rajapaksa.  However, the ban was lifted in August 2022, shortly after the current President assumed office. During Mahinda Rajapaksa’s tenure, the GTF, alongside numerous other Tamil Diaspora organisations, also faced a ban. The GTF yesterday said that the Joint Himalayan Declaration is a collaborative effort between them and the Buddhist delegation and it is meant to advocate a pluralistic Sri Lanka that actively promotes the wellbeing of all its communities.  The ’Joint Himalayan Declaration’ marks a significant step towards fostering dialogue and collaboration for a harmonious and inclusive Sri Lanka, the government said.  The President also expressed his appreciation for the initiative and committed to considering the recommendations outlined in the declaration. The diplomatic discourse sets the stage for continued efforts towards national reconciliation and progress, the government said.  GTF announced its year-long engagement aiming to foster understanding and peace among Sri Lanka’s diverse communities. Their initial structured dialogue in Nagarkot, Nepal, in April 2023 laid the groundwork for a significant national conversation, resulting in the ‘Himalaya Declaration’.  The GTF urged all Sri Lankan citizens to actively participate in this national conversation, emphasising the need for community interactions. They envision a united effort across all communities—Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim—to transform this dialogue into a genuine national movement. The goal is to achieve a new era characterised by peaceful coexistence, equal rights, dignity, and mutual trust among all citizens. The most impactful episode was the ethnic conflict and the resulting war against terrorism which lasted nearly 30 years. Its direct human cost was staggering – more than one hundred thousand deaths, tens of thousands of disappearances, and millions displaced, which created a new ‘Tamil Diaspora’ phenomenon.  While these losses were not limited to any one community, the proportional impact on the Tamil community was many folds higher, the GTF highlighted.  GTF also added that the Sinhala Buddhist community feared about preserving their historic and unique identity and pride of place in the only country they inhabit from the many forces they view as antagonistic, which include minority communities and the Tamil Diaspora.   By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The statement also said that the loan is accompanied by a USD one million grant from ADB’s Technical Assistance Special Fund to provide advisory, knowledge, and institutional capacity building for the Finance Ministry and Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). ADB’s ‘Financial Sector Stability and Reforms Programme’, in this connection, comprises two sub-programmes of USD200 million each. Subprogramme 1 targets short-term stabilisation and crisis management measures that were implemented in 2023, while subprogramme 2 is planned to be implemented in 2024 and focuses on structural reforms and long-term actions to restore growth in the banking sector.  The programme as a whole will holistically help strengthen the stability and governance of the country’s banking sector, improve the banking sector’s asset quality and deepen sustainable and inclusive finance, particularly for women-led micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, it said.  According to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) latest review, Sri Lanka’s economy is showing tentative signs of stabilisation, although a full economic recovery is not yet assured. “The programme’s overarching development objective is fully aligned with the country’s strategy of maintaining finance sector stability, while ensuring that banks are well-positioned for eventual recovery,” said ADB Country Director for Sri Lanka Takafumi Kadono. “The expected development outcome is a stable financial system providing access to affordable finance for businesses in various sectors of the economy.”"

As proposed by Anagarika Darmapala himself, Sir D.B. Jayathilaka was elected as the  President and C. S Dissanayake who was a Catholic,  was the appointed Secretary. All those who had served as political and religious leaders at the time were members of the Colombo YMBA, and the services rendered by them kept the Association alive even during hard times. W.A. De Silva, D.A. Hewavitharana, F.R. Senanayake, D.F. Wijewardane, Sir Ernest De Silva, D.D. Pedris, D.S. Senanayake, Karolis De Silva, and Sir Cyril De Soyza are some of the Presidents who rendered remarkable services. The structure of the Association continues with a Board of Management, comprising 32  members and a Board of Governors of 8 members for advisory purposes. For every Programme/Project, Committees are appointed. Reports of these Committees are to be proffered at the monthly meetings of the Board. The lion’s share of the annual expenditure of the YMBA is allocated for 33 ongoing projects, including a larger share for the education of children. A substantial amount is spent for the purpose of awarding scholarships to undergraduates, providing lunch for students in remote areas and for educational purposes in areas with fewer facilities. In addition, island-wide competitions are conducted on ‘Prose and Verse’, Art and Drama. Also, an Annual English Elocution Competition is held based on the tome, ‘Light of Asia’. An online English Education Programme is conducted for monks studying in Pirivenas. Enhancing the English knowledge of GCE Ordinary and Advanced Level students, training Buddhist monks to preach in the English language and a series of other courses are underway. Dahampasal Teacher Trainee programmes and Leadership Training programmes are organised monthly throughout the island. Thus, a sum of over Rs 50 million is spent on the education of children. Dhamma preaching and meditation, English and Sinhala damma discussion programmes are being held every weekend. In addition, damma School Examinations are conducted in the English medium and damma Abhidhamma Classes/Examinations are the programmes that are regularly held.        Measures have been taken to distribute nutrition packs for pregnant mothers and donate required items of medicine to hospitals. A programme named E-money is arranged for youth enabling them to earn ‘Dollars’ while being at home. This is a brief account of some of the activities carried out by the Colombo YMBA. The Executive Committee consists of top-tier personnel holding high-ranking posts in various establishments, and the services rendered by them to the Association are truly impressive. ‘ONE-Sri Lanka Dialogue’ is considered as the theme of the 125th anniversary. The main focus of the group of members including D.B Jayathilaka who initiated the Association in 1898 was on strengthening the Association providing necessary support for the struggle for freedom. The Buddhist elites, who rallied around the Colomno YMBA were national leaders who were respected by the people. Therefore, it was possible for Sir D.B. Jayathilaka to seek the cooperation of Muslim leaders like Sir Razik Fareed, and Tamil leaders like the Ponnambalam brothers and turn the national congress into a powerhouse imbued with ethnic and religious harmony and accomplish a significant volume of work towards the first struggle for freedom. The current social and political unrest in Sri Lanka and the tendency towards an ethnic dispute are the biggest hindrances to going forward as one nation. We are in the process of taking necessary measures to activate the pioneer task of the national struggle for freedom that started 125 years ago. We are shouldering the responsibility of bringing about a Sri Lankan society marked with ethnic, social and religious reconciliation. To this end, the Colombo YMBA has already laid a platform devoid of ethnic, religious or social discrimination. We cordially invite all of you to join us in this anniversary year and contribute towards the blossoming of ‘ONE-Sri Lanka Dialogue’, and dedicate yourselves towards the development of our motherland."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/12/09/celebrating-75-years-of-diplomatic-relations-between-sl-and-turkiye/,CELEBRATING 75 YEARS OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN SL and TÜRKIYE,Author not found,0,2023-12-08T20:31:00+00:00,"As we have almost reached the end of 2023, I would like to start by emphasising the significance of the year we just passed, not only to Türkiye but also to our profound relations between Türkiye and Sri Lanka.   The significance of year 2023 reverberates beyond the centenary proclamation of the Turkish Republic. We also commemorate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our Republics.  It is worth mentioning that Türkiye was among the first countries to recognise Sri Lanka’s independence 75 years ago. Our relation gained a new dimension with the establishment of our Embassy here in Colombo 10 years ago, indeed serving as a true testament to our growing and flourishing partnership.   However, I must say that our shared history goes far beyond 75 years, with an ancient relationship dating back to the time of the Ottoman Empire. The Muslims in Sri Lanka, who maintained close relations with the Ottomans during the British colonial era, have played a crucial role in this connection. Their devotion to the Ottoman Empire and contributions to the Muslim society were recognised with prestigious appointments of Shah-benders (Consuls) / Honorary Consuls to the Island by the Ottoman Sultans themselves.  Therefore, we are here today to celebrate this enduring relationship with the issuance of a special commemorative postage stamp on the occasion of the celebration of the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Türkiye.  As much as our deep-rooted connections, the design and decorations on the sides of this stamp features the iconic regions of Cappadocia in Türkiye and Sigiriya in Sri Lanka symbolising our intertwined histories.  I must say that both are renowned for their unique geographical structures and rich heritage, making them prominent tourist destinations.  I would like to shortly highlight the history behind the scenic beauty of Cappadocia, which might not be known to everyone in Sri Lanka.  Cappadocia is a region in Central Anatolia, Türkiye, where nature and history merge. It is best known for its unique geological features called fairy chimneys, underground cities and cave churches.   About 30 million years ago, in what is now central Türkiye, volcanoes spewed ash over the landscape. Eventually, the ash solidified into rock, called tuff, tens of meters thick. In the millions of years that followed, wind and water eroded the tuff into odd shapes, including spires, cones, even a camel.  Cappadocia, sculpted out of the tuff of Mount Erciyes and Mount Hasan through millions of years by sand and water erosion, became the seat of several civilisations, and a silent witness to the cultural history of Anatolia.  The earliest signs of monastic activity in Cappadocia can be traced back to the 4th century.  Cappadocia was included in the World Heritage List of UNESCO in 1985 under the name “Göreme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia” on natural and cultural criteria. The stunning landscape of Cappadocia is also one of the most popular destinations for hot air balloon rides in the world.  At the same time, Sigiriya, synonym to Lion’s Rock in Sinhalese, is also UNESCO World Heritage site located in the Central Province of Sri Lanka in the Matale District.  Sigiriya is also monolithic rock rising above the surrounding plain to a height of 349 meters above the sea level.  Adding to the similarities of the two regions, one can also take a scenic view of Sigiriya and its surrounding by hot air balloon rides. It is also a pleasant coincidence that these balloon tours are also organised by ‘SriLanka Balloon’, which is a Turkish company.  The stamps we are issuing today were designed by the talented Sri Lankan artist Vasantha Perera, well-known for having designed 39 unique stamps for the Sri Lanka Philatelic Bureau.  The stamps showcase the cultural parallels between our nations, with traditional elements like tulip and the carnation as side decorations. The tulip and the carnation are also common elements in both of Turkish and Sri Lankan traditional designs.  Last but not least, the stamps envelope reflects a drawing of the historic building ‘Villa Stamboul’, linking us to a shared past.  The lavish ‘Stamboul Villa’ was built by Sir Mohamed Marcan Marker, born in 1877 and served as the Honorary Consul for Ottoman Empire from 1903 until 1923, when the Ottoman Empire ceased to exit. He has named his villa after the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Istanbul.  The street on which the villa is established is a private road, and is also called “Stamboul Place”. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the late Mohamed Marcan Marker Efendi and to thank his family for allowing the drawing of the Villa Stamboul to be included in this memorial envelope, and especially Fathima Zohara Maritze Farook Marcan Marker, the granddaughter of late Mohamed Marcan Marker, who is honouring us today with her presence.   I would also like to express my gratitude to the valuable artist Vasantha Perera, Hasanthi Dissanayake, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Türkiye, the Postal Department as well as the Philatelic Bureau of Sri Lanka, for their contribution in making this common project a success. As we turn the page of a century based upon these monumental milestones, it is with great optimism that I envisage a flourishing future of enhanced cooperation between our two nations.  May the friendship between Türkiye and Sri Lanka continue to prosper in the centuries to come and may our shared journey ahead be filled with remarkable milestones of triumph and togetherness. "

The report that showed although a total of Rs 360 million was allocated for the e-motoring project between 2018 and 2022, only Rs 0.18 million has been spent thus far. The Audit Report emphasised that despite the allocation of funds, according to budget estimates over the years, the e-Motoring project, scheduled for implementation since 2018, has faced improper utilisation of resources. Despite Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena’s announcement on 29 May that the Department of Motor Traffic would transition to an online system within three months using the ‘e-Motoring system,’ no progress has been made in fulfilling this commitment, even though more than four months and four days have passed. The National Audit Office report also disclosed that Rs 20 million was allocated in 2022 to enhance the data system, addressing weaknesses and preventing irregularities.  Additionally, the report highlighted the lack of concrete steps taken by the Department of Motor Traffic to implement the ‘e-Motoring’ Project. Gunawardena acknowledged on 29 May, that certain bureaucratic obstacles hindered the government’s attempts to launch the ‘e-Motoring’ Project since 2017. He assured that the project is expected to be completed by the end of the year, aiming to digitise every process in response to allegations of fraud and corruption within the Motor Transport Department. Commissioner General of Motor Traffic Anuruddha Weerasinghe, informed Ceylon Today that the initial challenge of finding a suitable building for the e-Motoring Project has been resolved by acquiring a location in the Gangarama area.  The preparation of office premises has commenced and Weerasinghe expressed confidence that all activities can be completed by the end of the year, with registrations for the project set to commence soon.

But, Sri Lankan was in dire need of such plants although there was more than the required amount of plastic bottles, containers, fibre glass boats being released to the environment instead of being recycled, as the public was in need of such policy and legal backing to ensure that the procedure was followed, the NDCU Director noted.   There are several bottled water manufacturers in Sri Lanka, in addition to the manufacturers of fizzy drinks, who produce even the 175ml bottle. The dengue cases in the country, reaching a startling 76,488 while the death toll from January till 1 December 2023, has slowly but gradually risen to 46 according to statistics issued by the NDCU. Informed health sources noted that strengthening the existing laws and introducing strong policies in management of plastic containers, bottles, discarded tyres close to bus stands and depots and abandoned boats would assist largely in managing the mosquito borne disease.     By Dilanthi Jayamanne  "

A review discussion at the Ministry of Agriculture, chaired by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, highlighted the impact of economic instability and the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to a 50% decrease in production and income related to coconut fiber.

To address this issue, a committee, including Charaka Jayaratne, the Convenor of the Environmental Law Section of the Sri Lanka Bar Association, engaged in discussions with Wildlife Department officials, based on proposals presented to the committee. The primary focus was on amending clauses in the Wildlife and Flora Protection (Amendment) Act. Specific attention was given to key sections related to wild elephants in the Act, discussing amendments to Sections 3, 6, 19, 20, and 30. The committee proposed a revision of penalty fees for the killing of wild animals and suggested establishing a legal framework to impose appropriate punishments on offenders by designating wild elephants as public property. The issue of frequent elephant deaths, due to illegal high-voltage power lines, was also highlighted. Since there is a lack of clarity in the interpretation of the Animal and Flora Protection Act in this regard, the committee discussed introducing new clauses with clear interpretations and associated penalties. As a result, the committee recommended re-evaluating existing proposals related to the Act discussed during committee sessions. An agreement on relevant recommendations will be reached through a committee established under the Department of Wildlife, with the goal of finalising the Amendment of the Act within a specific timeframe."

Mali who had lived alone at the zoo for more than 40 years, could have died of heart failure, according to Manila Zoo’s chief veterinarian Dr. Heinrich Patrick Peña-Domingo. Animal rights activists had described as Mali as “one of the world’s saddest elephants”. There is no record of exactly how old she was, but she is believed to be 48 to 49 years old. Mali had been the Manila Zoo’s star attraction, sent as a gift by Sri Lanka in 1977 to then Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos. She would have been seen by nearly all Filipinos who had gone on field trips to the zoo while in primary school. Found orphaned in the wild, she was about three years old when she arrived in Manila. Mali was put in a pen with an older female elephant, Shiba, who had been rescued from a circus. Shiba died six years after Mali was brought to the zoo. In 2012, animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals started a campaign to have Mali moved to an elephant sanctuary in Thailand, calling her “perhaps one of the world’s saddest elephants”.  (Straits Times)"

Similarly, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is entitled to a secretary allowance of Rs 50,000, a fuel allowance of Rs 679,950 and a retirement allowance of Rs 97,500. Sirisena receives secretary allowance of Rs 100,000, fuel allowance of Rs 679, 950 and the retirement benefits of Rs 97,500.  Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, receives a secretary allowance of Rs 100,000, a fuel allowance of Rs 500,000, and a retirement benefit of Rs 97,500.

She is granted a secretary allowance of Rs 25,000, a fuel allowance of Rs 100,000, and a retirement allowance of Rs 65,000. The disclosure also highlights specific anomalies in the allowances distributed. It notes that during October 2023, Bandaranaike received a substantial fuel allowance of Rs 500,000, while Premadasa was allocated Rs 250,000, raising questions about the allocation discrepancies. According to the RTI application, dated 11 October 2023, based on the Article 36 (1) of the Constitution, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena both who served as presidents of the country, are entitled for the retirement payment only for their tenure as presidents and are being excluded from receiving a prime ministerial retirement payment as well as their Member of Parliament salaries.  According to the Presidents’ Entitlement Act No. 4 of 1986, every former President and the widow/widower of a former President are entitled to a pension, fuel allowance and secretarial allowance during his or her lifetime. Moreover, they are provided with a suitable house to live in during their lifetime without any rent. According to the information requests, made under the RTI Information Act No. 12 of 2016, it was clear that a single retired president or widow of a former president receive an allowance or protection given to former presidents (security) and that was not disclosed but Ceylon Today was urged to get that information from the Ministry of Defence and Ceylon Today would follow up.  The former presidents had stated to the media, on various occasions, that according to the Presidents’ Entitlement Act No. 4 of 1986, the pension that every former president is entitled to is credited to various funds and that they don’t take them for personal use.  But, it has come to light that no such funds had been credited to various funds as mentioned but they have credited these allowances to only their personal bank accounts. The allowances and perks paid monthly to retired presidents and widows of former presidents are discussed in annual budget under the President’s expenditure heading. Their allowances and privileges were discussed in the Parliament this time too.  Speaking in opposition to this budget, Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said:  “Rs 84 million was allocated for former presidents last year, but Rs 110 million has been allocated this year. Former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the two brothers, who have been accused by the Court of complicity in the collapse of the economy, are among them.

Suspicions have been raised that many other drugs may have been brought in this way abusing the Indian Credit Line. “This can only be considered a violation of the trust the Indian Government had placed in the Ministry of Health of Sri Lanka,” he lamented. It is also an incident that will bring Sri Lanka into disrepute internationally.   Dr. Sanjeeva urged the High Commission to inform the Sri Lankan President and initiate a probe into the medicinal drugs and the payments that had been made for them. He alleged that the funds from both countries had been misused by creating false positions within the Health Ministry to portray an unnecessary medicinal drug shortage.   He requested the new Health Secretary to conduct a comprehensive investigation into all the transactions that had taken place by using the fake positions, such as ‘Additional Secretary Medical Services’ in the Ministry of Health and stated that he would also complain to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in this connection.  In addition, he requested further steps be taken to increase transparency through a monitoring board in case of further payment of money under the Indian Credit Line.  Meanwhile, several other civil organisations have submitted a complaint to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) calling for an immediate investigation against Director General Health Services and other medical practitioners involved in the questionable transaction.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/11/25/david-cameron-faces-further-questions/,David Cameron faces further questions,Author not found,0,2023-11-24T20:33:00+00:00,"David Cameron is facing further questions about whether he was paid by Chinese interests to promote a port development in Sri Lanka, as footage emerged of him extolling its benefits. In the video from two months ago, the former British Prime Minister can be seen telling investors in Dubai that he wanted to “correct misapprehensions” about the project and quoting from a Chinese-funded study in support of the development. Lord Cameron, now the Foreign Secretary, has been under pressure over his paid speeches to drum up support for the Sri Lankan Port City, which is being built by a Chinese State firm, China Harbour Engineering Company. He has claimed not to have engaged with the Chinese firm in relation to the speeches, and his spokesperson has said he was hired by KPMG Sri Lanka. Pat McFadden, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, asked in Parliament on Thursday whether the Chinese State firm or the Sri Lankan Government were ultimately the client behind the payment. John Glen, the government minister responding for the Cabinet Office, said it was not a matter for him to answer but that Cameron has complied with the relevant processes. Kirsty Blackman, an SNP MP, told Parliament that the “perception of Lord Cameron being put into this role [as foreign secretary] having clearly been lobbying on behalf of hostile foreign interests does nothing for the perception of politicians as being trustworthy”. The footage of the event shows Cameron citing a glowing PwC report commissioned by the Chinese state company to make the case in favour of the project. “The PWC study shows it could create over 200,000 jobs, it could make a substantial contribution to Sri Lankan GDP,” he told the Dubai audience. A note at the bottom of the report says CHEC Port City (Private) Ltd is the client and that the report “relied on information provided by the client”. In the video, Cameron said it was “very good to be here this evening in Dubai to talk about the opportunities for people to invest” in the port, and that he was there to “correct misapprehensions” about its ownership. He stressed that Sri Lanka was the ultimate owner and the Chinese company had only leased part of the land. The Chinese company has a 99-year lease on two-thirds of the new city, which has fuelled fears from critics that Beijing could use Sri Lanka as a military base for docking naval ships. The firm is ultimately owned by the Chinese state, through a company blacklisted in the US for militarising areas of the South China Sea. Cameron has not disclosed how much he was given for the speeches via the Washington Speakers’ Bureau. His spokesperson told the Observer that they did not recognise Sri Lankan media reports that he was paid USD 210,000. Last week, the spokesperson told Politico, which first reported on Cameron’s involvement in the project: “Cameron has not engaged in any way with China or any Chinese company about these speaking events.”  (The Guardian)"

The highest expenditure, amounting to Rs 183 million (Rs 183,355,377.50), was allocated for printing works. Moreover, all election officers claimed significant expenses for overtime and holiday pay, with 25 District Offices claiming Rs 88 million (Rs 88,619,690.20). Funds amounting to rupees 576.81 million were provided by the Treasury to the EC in eight phases from 31 January to 19 October to conduct the LG election.

One significant requirement is that interested bidders must have operated a minimum fleet of 20 aircraft continuously for five years, within the last ten years, before the Prequalification Application Submission Deadline. Additionally, non-financial institution bidders must show a minimum net worth of USD 200 million.  Alternatively, bidders should exhibit experience in successfully acquiring, transitioning ownership and operating a non-airline enterprise during the same ten-year period. The deadline for the submission of expressions of interest is set for 5 December 2023, at 2.10 p.m., the government announced.  Elaborating on the technical qualification criteria, prospective bidders should possess non-airline experience of a scale and complexity similar to that of SriLankan Airlines. The government has highlighted a preference for bidders with experience in SriLankan Ground Handling Services but will also consider prospective bidders with experience in SriLankan Catering or similar services for international airlines. Under the Financial Qualification Criteria, the EoI specifies that entities aiming to fulfil the financial capability requirement must either be the prospective bidder itself, a related party of the bidder, or part of a consortium through consortium members or their related parties. Additionally, non-financial institution bidders must demonstrate a minimum net worth of USD 200,000,000 (USD 200 million) or its equivalent based on the latest audited financial statements, dated no earlier than 31 December 2022, or the entity’s last fiscal year’s closing date, whichever is later.  Moreover, bidders are required to provide evidence of the capability to secure loans of at least USD 100 million for the proposed transaction. The government’s stringent criteria signify a focused effort to attract capable and financially stable entities for the potential acquisition of SriLankan Airlines. This move aims to ensure the future sustainability and growth of the airline while maintaining operational excellence. The prequalification process is expected to yield a shortlist of candidates poised to take on the responsibility of steering Sri Lanka’s national carrier into a new era of stability and prosperity.

This will be presented by the St. Cecilia’s Choir of St. Joseph’s College, Colombo 10.  Carols are an expression of joy that resides in our hearts, with a rhythm of God’s love, a radiance of God’s Glory, surrounded by his caring arms and gift wrapped in His plan for us. “A Christmas Carol” is a beautiful story for the Advent season because it is a tale in which the past, the present and the future all come together in one transformative night. The singing of Carols reminds us that God, in His love for us, sent His Son to be one of us. Christmas is a time to celebrate one of the most remarkable miracles found in the Holy Bible. On this Christmas Eve, we remember the birth of Jesus and the good news he brings to us. It is an opportunity to pause and give thanks for the love, hope and joy found in Jesus, our Saviour and friend. We find the real joy of Christmas when we make our Saviour the focus of the season. One notable aspect of Carols is their ubiquity. They are across cultural, ethnic and even religious boundaries.  The title of this year’s Carols is ‘Jesu Salvator Mundi’, which means ‘Saviour of the World’. The College Choir comprising 90 members will be presenting a wonderful array of carols in English, Sinhala, Tamil and Latin languages. As usual, this choral presentation will bring happiness and joyfulness to all participants. His Lordship Rt. Rev. Dr. Anton Ranjith, Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Colombo will grace and honour the occasion as the Chief Guest.

This was revealed by a senior official from the Department of Railways, during an interview with Ceylon Today.  The official highlighted that as a result of several issues within the department, a minimum of 214 train journeys across the country are experiencing delays daily, with a total of 64,200 delays recorded in the past 10 months.  According to the normal train service schedule, the department is expected to operate 390 train journeys per day, serving approximately 500,000 commuters. He pointed out that the cancellation of around 800 train journeys in the past few months was due to the non-reporting for duty by locomotive drivers, station masters and other Railway Department personnel.  The official highlighted that the workforce tends to take sick leave consistently during the last week of each month, and initiating disciplinary actions has proven challenging due to their tendency to engage in trade union action when such measures are implemented. The official emphasised that the prevailing situation within the department is a result of inadequate management and control by the top leadership.  General Manager of Railways H.M.K.W. Bandara, acknowledged the challenges, but stated that despite the current situation, the department is still operating 363 train journeys daily. He affirmed that efforts have been made to minimise train delays to a significant extent. Deputy General Manager of Railways, N.J. Indipola mentioned that the official data on train cancellations and delays is currently available only from January to July. According to this data, out of the 66,613 scheduled journeys, 11,524 had to be cancelled. Remarkably, around 80 per cent of these journeys experienced delays of less than half-an hour, while approximately 20 per cent faced delays exceeding half-an hour, he added. BY Mithun Jayawardhana"

The final decision on the COPE’s future will be taken by its empowered members following parliamentary protocol.  This decision follows allegations by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa that a COPE meeting was deliberately scheduled at 01:00 pm on Friday, a time when two Muslim MPs S.M. Marikkar and Rauff Hakeem, could not attend due to Friday prayers.  Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella urged a non-political resolution to the issues within the committee.  Responding to these concerns, the Speaker announced the suspension of all COPE meetings until further notice. He said, COPE meetings will not resume until matters concerning its Chairman Ranjith Bandara are resolved.  Following the Speaker’s announcement about the suspension, former COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti asserted that the Speaker should have taken action to remove corrupt MPs from COPE instead of indefinitely suspending its sittings.  He believed that the responsibility lay with the Speaker to grant legal powers to the Committee to deal with corrupt MPs and officials, rather than halting the parliament, watchdog’s crucial deliberations. Handunnetti emphasised that the primary role of COPE was to inspect recommendations and data submitted by the Attorney General. According to the outcomes of impartial probes, he suggested empowering COPE to make recommendations for legal action against offenders and wrongdoers. However, Handunnetti expressed doubts about the ability of the current House to diligently fulfil this task, given the presence of individuals already rejected by the public. He also criticised the recent controversial behaviour of the current Chairman of the Committee, Ranjith Bandara of the SLPP, stating that if the head of an independent Committee could not uphold integrity, it became challenging to maintain public trust and gain the support of the majority of MPs. Also, former COPE Chairman before Bandara, Dr. Charitha Herath echoed Handunnetti’s concerns, claiming that the current Chairman’s conduct had cast serious doubts on the Committee’s ability to carry out its tasks efficiently and impartially. He warned that if the Speaker did not urgently address this situation, continuing with the Committee would be futile, as its true purpose had been compromised. Herath noted that previous COPE Chairpersons worked tirelessly to uphold the Committee’s image through exemplary conduct and revealing wrongdoers to the country. However, he argued that Prof. Bandara’s behaviour had irreversibly damaged that reputation. He emphasised that the Speaker must promptly address this issue and appoint an MP with impeccable conduct to continue the Committee’s essential work on behalf of the country and its people.

This absence of a quality assurance programme has posed significant challenges for small and medium -scale spice producers seeking to export their products. In response to this issue, Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera, was briefed on the difficulties faced by the small and medium spice industry. Consequently, the Minister directed the National Spices Corporation to launch a quality assurance programme for spice products from small and medium-scale industrialists involved in spice processing. To implement this initiative, the National Spices Corporation has initiated a tripartite agreement with the internationally recognised SGS Institute of Singapore. Starting from next December, it will be mandatory for all small and medium -sized spice producers in Sri Lanka to obtain the standard certificate issued through this programme, stated by Kumudini Arya Gunasena, the Chairman of the National Spices Corporation. The tripartite agreement involves the collaboration of the National Spices Corporation, Hatton National Bank and the SGS Institute. A discussion on the spice standards certification programme took place at the Ministry of Plantation Industry, attended by  Minister Mahinda, Secretary of the Ministry Janaka Dharmakeerthi and other officials. Pepper, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon are the primary plantation spices in Sri Lanka, widely used globally. However, the minister expressed concern over the damage to the Sri Lanka Spice brand due to the export of substandard spices by unscrupulous traders. To address this, the spice certification scheme will be launched after the signing of the tripartite agreement in the second week of December, allowing producers to obtain the certificate at a concessional price. Given the international recognition of this certificate, small and medium-scale spice manufacturers in Sri Lanka will gain unhindered access to global markets for their products."

COPE Chairman Ranjith Bandara stated that the alleged corruption within SLC would be thoroughly scrutinised during the committee meeting. Concurrently, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena directed Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe to furnish details about the allegations against SLC to the COPE.

Additionally, he claimed that a group of officials attempted to leave the country following an alleged fund transfer of two million USD. In response to these developments, a joint proposal for the removal of the Office Bearers of SLC was unanimously passed in Parliament on Thursday (9), after a 7-hour debate involving both government and opposition representatives. The proposal underscores the imperative for the current Office Bearers of Sri Lanka Cricket to step down and advocates for new legislation in cricket administration through a fresh Act to ensure a corruption-free and transparent governance of cricket.

In a statement released on Friday (10), the ICC said the SLC had breached its obligations as a member, in particular the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and without Government interference. In its statement, the ICC said: “The conditions of the suspension will be decided by the ICC Board in due course.” Earlier, Sri Lanka’s Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe sacked the entire SLC Board on Monday (November 6) and appointed an interim committee headed by Arjuna Ranatunga but the Court of Appeal reinstated the Board a day later as a 14-day stay order was issued on the announcement that dissolved the current board. Commenting on the ban, a top source at SLC said Sri Lanka could lose the hosting right of the Under-19 World cup where Sri Lanka were set to host the event in January.   “The ban has been imposed due to political interference. As a result of the ban, ICC might strip the country of the right to host the Under-19 World Cup in January 2024.  If we lose the hosting rights, it will be a loss of USD 2.5 million,” a top source at SLC said. When asked about what should be done in order to lift the ban, the source added, “In order to lift the ban, the interim committee should be removed since ICC recognised only the elected body.

Dr. Ravindra Kariyawasam, the National Coordinator of the Centre for Environment and Nature Studies (CENS), alleged that in the memorandum, Prime Minister Gunawardena emphasises the national imperative of establishing a practical water resource policy. This policy aims to efficiently manage the limited water resources in the face of unexpected environmental changes affecting drinking, irrigation, energy, and service needs in the country. He challenged the assertion that the water resource policy provides an immediate solution to environmental changes. He deems it unacceptable and points to Article 5.5, which, while acknowledging water as a public right, also places all management activities under the purview of this policy. Sections 6.4 to 6-14 of the policy discuss water management, proposing the establishment of a council for water management. This council would take decisions for water management based on regulations, laws, and decisions, potentially involving the imposition of a fee for commercial water use. Dr. Kariyawasam warned of the policy’s potential to charge fees, even for agricultural water usage, under the guise of water management. He expresses concern that the policy, masked as water management, seeks to impose a tax on water, thereby restricting free access for both people and animals. The policy also outlines the establishment of an institution responsible for managing water capacities, canals, and rivers within wildlife resource zones and forest conservation zones. Funding for the maintenance and management of this institution would be collected through the policy. Dr. Kariyawasam noted that previous governments implemented policies of selling water and charging fees for the establishment of water management agencies. Despite discussions on the memorandum’s implementation, the government is concealing the policy as a secret initiative, he alleged. BY Mithun Jayawardhana"

Informed sources said on Friday (10) that Dr. Gunasekara had been holding the position at the time he had been appointed as the CEO of the NMRA. However, they expressed surprise at Health Minister, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana’s decision to appoint him, who had several allegations of corruption, including the most recent immunoglobulin scam, to a position of such responsibility.  Also there were concerns on whether Acting Director of the MRI, Dr. Dedunu Dias, who had been managing the MRI without corruption allegations, had been demoted whilst giving Dr. Gunasekara, with all allegations of corruption against him, a promotion. Dr. Dias chaired the Experts’ Committee appointed this August to probe incidents of drug allergies, which resulted in patient deaths and blindness following cataract surgeries. They alleged however, that with the appointment of Dr. Gunasekara to the position any investigations or probes into these cases were likely to be sabotaged.  In a letter dated 9 November 2023 signed by Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sri Chandragupta, the former NMRA CEO, who was recalled to the Health Ministry on 7 November 2023, was reappointed as the Director of the MRI with immediate effect. The letter has been copied to the Secretary of the PSC, DGHS, Chairman NMRA, Deputy Director General (Laboratory Services), Acting Director MRI, Chief Accounting Officer and Director (Administration). Meanwhile, the Government Medical Officers’ Forum (GMOF) explained that the usual form, when there were allegations of corruption against a medical administrator, was to recall him or her to the Health Ministry with no duties assigned till the allegations were probed and the person acquitted. He or she was expected to report to the Health Secretary or the Director General Health Services (DGHS) till such time. The GMOF President, Dr. Rukshan Bellana noted that this could only be viewed as a move to disrupt even the satisfactory service that was being carried out by the MRI’s Acting Director. Also the former CEO of the NMRA has the favour of a top official in the Health Ministry. Dr. Bellana accused the Health Ministry, under the new Health Minister, of having made two blunders of which the re- appointment of the Dr. Gunasekara, to his former post at the MRI was one while the other was the removal of the Administrative Officer of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), who was an officer appointed to that position by the Public Service Commission (PSC). The Ministry has observed dual standards with regard to these two officials, he alleged.    By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

As discussed during the recent meeting of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), this move is anticipated to result in a 10 per cent increase in fuel prices. On 31 October, the Government announced an increase in VAT from the current 15 per cent to 18 per cent to fulfil the country’s obligations to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Notably, diesel, petrol, and coal were exempt from VAT until now, and the Finance Ministry’s proposal aims to initiate taxation on these products effective 1 January 2024. It is important to highlight that VAT will not be imposed on kerosene. The Cabinet has endorsed President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s resolution for the VAT rate increase.  The new 18 per cent VAT will be applied to goods and services that were previously exempted. It was reported that the IMF has withheld the second tranche due to Sri Lanka’s inability to meet revenue targets, despite a 51 per cent increase in tax revenue during the first nine months of 2023.

By financing Adani in the CWIT port development at the Port of Colombo, US strategically entered Sri Lanka’s maritime industry.   According to Karan Adani, the total investment for phases I and II of CWIT is expected to be around USD 1.2 billion for WCT now known as Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT). The CWIT will feature a 1.4 km berth length, capable of simultaneously handling three vessels of 20,000 TEUs each, once developed, he added.  This strategic move by India and the US is checked in as counterbalance to China’s predominant influence and role in the port business in Sri Lanka and maritime stronghold in the region under its ambitious Road and Belt Initiative (BRI). On the other hand, the US funding agency, the DFC has prioritised that it would support projects in developing countries and also advance US foreign policy. The DFC website also cites that it will coordinate closely with its US Government counterparts to ensure investments complement and support US foreign policy goals.  “The project is financed at a 70-30 ratio, translating to 70 per cent debt and 30 per cent equity for phase one, representing an approximately USD 700 million investment. The total investment for phases one and two is expected to be around USD 1.2 B. The anticipated return is a minimum of 16%, with expectations of reaching significant milestones over the years, similar to their achievements with other ports,” Karan Adani told the Indian channels following the landmark agreement with the DFC in Colombo. Adani Ports has partnered with John Keells Holdings and Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Adani Ports strategically chose this port due to nearly 50 per cent of containers from India being transshipped to Colombo, Karan Adani said. The objective is to make it the most efficient terminal, providing assurance to customers using their ports in India by offering seamless connectivity, visibility, and transparency on volume movement. Adani emphasised the synergy between Vizhinjam in Kerala and Colombo, acting as complementary terminals and setting similar benchmarks of all Adani ports. The CWIT was awarded on the basis that India’s largest port operator will hold a 51 per cent stake in the terminal and John Keells Holdings will own 34 per cent. The remaining 15 per cent of the stake will be owned bySri Lanka Ports Authority. DFC’s CEO, Nathan, during his visit to Colombo, highlighted its significance as a substantial investment in a new deepwater shipping container terminal at the Port of Colombo.  Nathan emphasised that the terminal will expand shipping capacity, fostering greater prosperity for Sri Lanka without adding to sovereign debt. Nathan said, with the loan, Sri Lanka will be the “second biggest exposure” for his institution in the Indo-Pacific region, after India, the AP quoted. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan "

AHK, the official arm of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK), serves as a representative for German commercial and industrial interests operating in Sri Lanka. The meeting, part of a series of dialogues initiated by the SJB, aimed to refine the party’s policy platform through interactions with various business chambers and professional organisations. Leader of the Opposition and the SJB, Sajith Premadasa, requested a knowledge-sharing session with AHK to facilitate direct interactions between German business representatives and the SJB Alliance. The AHK Sri Lanka delegation, comprising Directors, CEOs, Country Representatives and Financial Controllers from diverse sectors such as renewable energy, mining, insurance, industrial equipment, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, brand agencies, and industrial manufacturing, joined the discussion. Premadasa highlighted the SJB’s commitment to fostering a business-friendly, transparent, and consistent policy environment that supports economic growth. He emphasised the importance of market-driven economic reforms to promote sustainable and inclusive growth. Key concerns raised by the AHK delegation, included issues with the Board of Investment (BOI) restrictions on foreign company incorporation and ownership in Sri Lanka. The threshold for tax holidays and incentives was noted as relatively high compared to other nations, hindering smaller businesses’ growth potential. Ownership restrictions and limitations on land leases were also discussed. The AHK delegation expressed concerns about State procurement practices, advocating for professional and independent evaluations of cost/quality dynamics. Issues with approvals and registrations in the medical devices and pharmaceutical industry were highlighted, suggesting a fast-tracked process for products already approved by international regulators. Premadasa assured the delegation that the SJB would work to remove unnecessary hurdles for the business sector. He pledged to create a business environment that allows German companies to thrive and contribute to Sri Lanka’s development. A commitment to historic investments in education to build a tech-savvy workforce aligned with global demands was also emphasised. The Opposition Leader expressed gratitude for the insights shared by the AHK delegation, promising follow-up meetings to implement necessary changes.

In the last Yala season, these fertile lands, earmarked for the harvest, fell victim to flooding caused by incessant rainfall persisting for over a month and a half. In response to the crisis, Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industry Mahinda Amaraweera, promptly directed the Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board to assess the extent of the damage inflicted during the prolonged and severe drought in the preceding Yala season, the Ministry of Agriculture said. The findings revealed a staggering 64,088 acres of paddy fields damaged by the drought, affecting a total of 11,460 farmers due to crop losses from rain. In light of these distressing circumstances, W.M.M.B.

The Minister stressed the importance of providing the compensation within the current fiscal year. In the event of any delays in government disbursements, he emphasised the need for the board to utilise its funds to ensure timely compensation for the affected farmers.

With the vast majority of these incidents being reported in the Western and Southern Provinces of the country, the Ministry of Public Security along with Sri Lanka Police, Police Special Task Force and State Intelligence Service has placed special focus on these areas to reduce criminal activities of these groups. Speaking to Ceylon Today, Police Media Spokesman, SSP Nihal Thalduwa said between 1 January and 8 November 2023, 36 incidents have been reported in the Southern Province and 44 incidents have been reported in the Western Province. He also said that even though all these incidents aren’t organised crime-related, a vast majority of them are. In a recent media release, the Chief of the Police Special Task Force (STF) said over 17 organised crime groups are active in the Western and Southern Provinces, with 12 of these organisations being based in the Western Province, whose leaders are carrying out their operation while residing abroad. He also said the STF is presently working with the CID and Interpol to have these suspects extradited. According to SSP Thalduwa, a majority of the members of these criminal organisations that have been arrested or are being monitored are Army deserters and individuals who have completed their service contracts. He also said these individuals aren’t exclusively from the Army but are made up of (former) members of all the Security Forces of the country (Army, Navy, Air Force and Police). SSP Thalduwa also said there has been an increase in threats against law enforcement authorities and Security Forces. With the increase in shootings and killings, the Police force has increased their raids and security checks, says SSP Thalduwa, which he claims has resulted in an increase in threats and intimidation of officers by these criminal organisations. He also added that due to the leaders of these criminal gangs being based overseas, they have become emboldened as they believe they are out of reach of Sri Lankan law enforcement agencies. Referring to the reports on the killing of Police Officers islandwide, he said almost all of these cases are directly related to organised criminal activity as the law enforcement agencies cracking down on drug traffickers and their networks has become an issue for these gang leaders. SSP Thalduwa said it is important that the public understands that these organised crime groups and drug traffickers are not two separate groups, but the same entity that is using the same networks.  Regarding combating organised crime and drug trafficking issues within the law enforcement sector, Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles, speaking at an event held in Unawatuna last week, said all law enforcement officers should fearlessly take pertinacious action against criminals and assured his “unwavering support” during his tenure as the Minister of Public Security. He also criticised the failure of the Deputy Inspector Generals (DIGs) and Officers-in-Charge (OICs) of the Southern Province in being more focused on arresting these criminals. Referring to an incident in Galduwa, the Minister said in the Southern Province, “We issued clear instructions regarding the placement of roadblocks. To verify whether these measures were being implemented as instructed, we had two individuals, wearing full-face helmets and jackets, ride a motorcycle through the roadblock at Galduwa Junction multiple times. Unfortunately, none of the Police Officers deployed at the roadblock noticed this particular motorcycle passing through suspiciously multiple times.” According to Minister Alles, officials within the Police force must closely monitor the raids and counter crime operations within their respective areas, and the neglect and lax of their oversight responsibilities trickle down onto lower-ranking officials. He also added that the Sri Lanka Police must stop relying on the STF to handle all aspects of law enforcement, and that law enforcement officers, whatever the rank may be, will no longer be placed in critical roles if they are unable to take a firm stance when combating organised crime. The Minister also accused some of the unnamed OICs of the Southern Province of allegedly conniving with these organised crime groups on the phone and said strict action would be taken against the said officers if they continued to work with these organised crime groups.

He lamented the neglect suffered by the spice industry over the past three to four decades, leading to a decline in income. The President stated, “Sri Lanka once had the world’s best spices, but our neglect of the industry in the past 30-40 years has led to a decline in our income from spices. This needs to change.” Highlighting the role of spices in enhancing Sri Lanka’s export-oriented economy, President Wickremesinghe called for a broader market focus. He acknowledged the government’s initial steps, such as establishing a dedicated department for cinnamon development and urged a targeted effort to improve the production and export of various spices, including pepper. President Wickremesinghe commented on Sri Lanka’s potential in high-quality coffee and cocoa production, expressing the government’s readiness to allocate land and resources for their development. He called for collective efforts from all stakeholders to achieve this goal. Emphasising the need for an immediate agricultural modernisation programme with the integration of new technologies, the President aimed to enhance productivity and efficiency for global competitiveness. President Wickremesinghe urged the Spice Council to formulate a plan for promoting the spice industry, assuring full support from himself and the concerned Minister. He stressed the pivotal role of the private sector in this revitalisation endeavour. The President’s call signals a renewed focus on transforming Sri Lanka’s spice industry into a key player in the global market."

Despite the absence of rain in lower-lying areas, the elevated regions experience heavy rainfall, causing an abrupt increase in water levels. Numerous incidents of accidents resulting from this phenomenon have been reported. In light of these dangers, Udaya Kumara urged people to refrain from bathing near waterfalls to ensure their safety.

The five suspects, namely Indika Sampath, Gayeshan Abeyrathna, Samith Sandaruwan, Indika Jayasekara and Dhanajaya Gayan were produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrate. The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) of the CID arrested the suspects. The Court ordered the suspects’ passports to be placed in the custody of Court and their mobile phones to be handed over to the FCID. State Counsel Oswald Perera, representing the Attorney General’s Department, informed Court that a sum of Rs 905 million has been found in the accounts of these suspects. He also stated that the FCID has uncovered that nearly 220,000 people have fallen victim to this pyramid-style financial racket. Perera further informed Court that, based on the ongoing investigations, a financial fraud of about Rs 30 billion has occurred. The suspects have acquired property including hotels, land and vehicles, using the money obtained from the public. He also mentioned that it has been reported in the media that three individuals caught up in this financial racket have committed suicide due to financial losses. This has led to concerns that other affected individuals might take the law into their own hands and seek retribution against the suspects. The State Consel requested the Court to remand the suspects, as it appears that they have committed an offense under Section 83 C of the Banking Act and the Money Laundering Act. FCID OIC Chief Inspector Jayasundara, represented the CID and a group of lawyers, including President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratne, appeared on behalf of the suspects. On 24 August, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) imposed a ban on nine entities, including ‘OnmaxDT,’ for engaging in pyramid schemes, which are prohibited in the country. The CBSL warned that anyone who directly or indirectly initiates, offers, promotes, advertises, conducts, finances, manages, or directs a prohibited type of pyramid scheme would be held liable for a punishable offense.

Many of these women face the unfortunate circumstance of being unable to afford legal representation or lacking knowledge of the necessary procedures, which ultimately results in their incarceration, she said. A significant number of these female inmates are detained for minor offences that could warrant release on bail. Kumarasinghe further mentioned her plan to present this proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers, with the President, who also holds the portfolio for Women and Child Affairs, facilitating the process. In addition to addressing the challenges faced by women in remand, there are plans in motion to introduce new legislation aimed at providing therapy and counselling services for victims of rape and child abuse through a State mechanism. The proposed measures seek to establish a system that ensures these survivors receive the necessary psychological support and care to help them heal and recover from their traumatic experiences. It is anticipated that this proposal will be presented to the President, who holds the portfolio for Women and Child Affairs, with the ultimate aim of obtaining approval from the Cabinet. These steps reflect a commitment to improving the overall well-being and protection of women and children in Sri Lanka, addressing both their legal and psychological needs, Kumarasinghe said.

This came to light when health officials claimed they will be able to provide a better meal for kids if the Government would increase this amount. The health officials recently went before the Parliamentary Select Committee appointed to look into whether the child malnutrition issue in Sri Lanka is aggravating and to identify short-term, medium-term and long-term measures to be taken in that regard, as well as to oversee the speedy implementation of the identified measures. The committee chaired by MP Vadivel Suresh insisted that the actual numbers or the country’s situation on child malnutrition has not been revealed in the statistical reports presented by the government agencies regarding child malnutrition. The Select Committee therefore, urged the officials to provide accurate data on malnutrition among children before the Budget 2024, so that they could furnish a comprehensive set of proposals to the government on the elimination of malnutrition amongst children.  The members of the committee also explained the importance of having accurate data on malnutrition as well as on obesity among children in Sri Lanka. The Committee also deeply delved upon providing Triposha all around the country. Officials of the Sri Lanka Triposha Company told the committee that at present Triposha is not issued to children between the age of six months and three years and that Triposha is provided only to children between the ages of three and five years. The officials of the company, who spoke about the non-issuance of Triposha for children between six months and three years, said that due to a problem in the relevant criteria in the production of Triposha for that age group, Triposha products are not made. However, after the Ministry of Health resolved the issue, the officials pointed out that triposha can be produced for that age group as well. By Gagani Weerakoon"

Many are not pleased with the team’s performance and have also criticised the management of cricket in the country. As tensions rise, there are concerns that fans may stage protests at the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) premises. To prevent potential unrest, the Sri Lanka Police have taken a proactive step by deploying an anti-riot squad in front of the SLC office. This precautionary measure is aimed at maintaining order and security in case of demonstrations or protests. The loss to India has ignited a wave of fan discontent, with many expressing their disappointment in the team’s performance. Questions about accountability and responsibility within the sports community have gained prominence as a result of these developments. This has now led to a blame game among officials, with accusations flying between the Sports Ministry and the SLC administration and both parties have sent letters to President Ranil Wickremesinghe pointing fingers at each other for the embarrassing performance of the men’s national cricket team in the ICC Men’s World Cup 2023. Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has issued a stern ultimatum, calling for the immediate resignation of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Board. He warned of severe consequences if this demand is not met. In a statement, the Minister held both SLC and the national selectors accountable for the disappointing World Cup performance, which was further exacerbated by the team’s recent defeat. He also sent a letter to the President. On the other side of the equation, SLC complained to the President, alleging that the Sports Minister’s inaction has obstructed several of their activities. They emphasised that necessary approvals for hosting the Under 19 World Cup and a franchise-based T10 league in Sri Lanka have yet to be granted by the Minister. "

The commission is expected to present its report within six months. This commission’s mandate is to gather, investigate and examine all existing election laws and regulations and provide recommendations for necessary amendments to electoral laws. The President issued the Gazette notification, appointing a commission, with the objective of proposing revisions to electoral laws that align with contemporary requirements and uphold the integrity of political parties. This commission operates in accordance with the stipulations outlined in Sections 2 and 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948 and is chaired by the retired Chief Justice, President’s Advocate Vevage Priyasath Gerard Dep. The other commissioners serving on this commission include Sundaram Arumanayagam, Senanayake Alisandralage, Nalin Jayantha Abeysekera PC, Rajitha Naveen Christopher Senaratne, Ahmed Lebbe Mohammed Salim, Sagarika Delgoda, Esther Sriani Nimalka Fernando, and Vitaranage Deepani Samantha Rodrigo. The primary tasks of this commission include a comprehensive examination of existing election laws and the formulation of recommendations for their improvement. These recommendations extend to guidelines on the responsible utilisation of media by political parties and independent groups. Furthermore, the commission is entrusted with gathering information, conducting investigations and delivering recommendations regarding the implementation of a code of conduct that governs the conduct of political parties, enhancing the regulations concerning party registration, and ensuring their actions are transparent and accountable to the public. In addition to these responsibilities, the commission is also tasked with addressing several critical issues. These include augmenting the representation of women and youth in political processes, reducing the time between the announcement of an election and the release of results and exploring the possibility of electronic voting using modern technology as an alternative to traditional paper ballots. Finally, the commission is called upon to provide recommendations related to the proposed constitution. Furthermore, recognising the imperative to establish and uphold mutual trust between Sri Lankan voters and political parties, various globally renowned organisations, including the Inter-Parliamentary Union, have diligently focused on delineating criteria for enhancing the transparency and accountability of political parties. This heightened scrutiny stems from the notable escalation in the financial expenses associated with election campaigns, encompassing elections. The role of financial resources in shaping political landscapes and the potential for undue influence on policy decisions has garnered considerable concern. Additionally, there has been a growing awareness of individuals with criminal backgrounds infiltrating political parties, supplanting stable political organizations with short-term political entities, consequently contributing to political instability, the PMD said."

In the letters, Wannila Aththo pointed out that the Vedda community primarily residing in the Uva, Eastern, and North Central provinces in areas like Dambana, Rathugala, Pollebedda, Dalukana, Dimbulagala, Vahari, and Muttur, have faced economic, social, and cultural challenges as they integrated into mainstream society. “The Vedda community is characterised by its unique linguistic identity, using the ‘Vedi language’ for communication, but many members are not literate in reading or writing Sinhala, which is often the language used in loan agreements. Even when documents are provided in both Sinhala and Tamil, understanding the contents remains a challenge,” the Vedda Chief said. The unregulated nature of these loans, coupled with questionable and illegal conditions, has created a dire situation for many borrowers, within the Vedda community, as microfinance agents continuously harass those who could not pay back loans with higher interest. “Numerous instances exist in which individuals posing as company agents demand sexual bribes from victimised women. These incidents have also led to broken families and single-parent households. Many victims have lost their assets, such as land and jewellery, to repay the loans. There is no mechanism in place to assess the impact on the children in these victimised families,” he emphasised. The Vedda Chief sought relief from the debt crisis and a more streamlined system for loan disbursement and collection. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

It’s an opportunity to reflect on the man behind this pivotal development, Sir Richard Aluwihare, whose influence reshaped the Sri Lanka Police Service, paving the way for its evolution into the modern force we recognise today. In 1948, Sir Richard Aluwihare, the first Ceylonese IGP, left an indelible mark on the Sri Lanka Police Service when he established the Sri Lanka Kennels in Colombo. This marked a significant milestone in the history of law enforcement in Sri Lanka. The kennels began its journey with the local training of German Shepherd Canine Sleuths, Sheba and Rex, under the diligent guidance of two Police constables, Burtus and Armstrong. In 1948, the Sri Lanka Police Kennels were established in Colombo, but in 1949, they were relocated to Kandy, a decision motivated by the belief that the climate and the proximity of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Kandy would enhance the training of the Canine Sleuths. Over the years, many Police Officers have been trained abroad to acquire the skills needed to handle and train the Canine Sleuths. In 2011, a historic moment occurred when a hundred Canine Sleuths were brought into the country at once. The term ‘Canine Sleuths’ harkens back to their origins as “canine investigators” in 1872. These remarkable animals possess an astounding 330 million scent-detecting cells, while humans have just six million. Moreover, they have pheromones or scent receptors that vary from one human to another, much like fingerprints. It’s these remarkable attributes that empower the Canine Sleuths to track down offenders with astonishing accuracy."

According to internal Government sources, President Wickremesinghe has expressed that a General Election is inevitable if Government’s main coalition, the SLPP continues to threaten holding the President to ransom, citing numbers in Parliament. Following last Monday’s mini Cabinet reshuffle, which only saw transferring of portfolios, the SLPP leadership has sent warnings to the President in the guise of expressing ‘displeasure’. SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam claimed the removal of Keheliya Rambukwella as the Minister of Health was a “wrong decision” by the President.  “It is regrettable that such an appointment has been made as the President was able to form a government only through the support of a majority of SLPP members. Only five SLFP members have given their support to the President so far,” he said. Voicing the party’s displeasure with regards to the appointments of two members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to both Cabinet and non-Cabinet portfolios, Kariyawasam asserted that they are unafraid to call the President out on his “wrong decisions”. Meanwhile, MP Namal Rajapaksa said, the President should have a better understanding of coalition politics, adding that problems cannot be solved through Cabinet reshuffles. Rajapaksa said, the President should know to hold discussions with the alliance leaders and maintain peace within the party. “During the Yahapalanaya Government both leaders went in two different directions and the result was the impact on the nation causing instability,” he warned.  Meanwhile, the new alliance of MPs who broke away from the SLPP and are in the ‘anti-Basil Rajapaksa Camp’ challenged the SLPP to voice their opposition to the President and sit in the Opposition. Group leader MP Nimal Lanza said, by carrying out a Cabinet reshuffle the President has done right by the country and noted that if the SLPP is unwilling to work with the President they could defeat the forthcoming budget and force the President to call for a snap General Election. He made these comments addressing the media yesterday. Speaking further he said, “The main grouse of the SLPP General Secretary is not the reshuffling of the Health Ministry portfolio, but the majority of such posts being accorded to the SLFP and not to them. It is a known fact that by merging the Ministry of Plantations with that of the Agriculture Ministry both those Ministries would be able to work in unity. Hence, the decision taken by the President is prudent and cannot be faulted.” If the SLPP has control of this regime then they ought to show it to the country rather than shedding crocodile tears behind the scenes. Without making baseless allegations they should resort to topple this regime or else they could sit in the Opposition. They should strive to end this culture of phony media shows to dupe the masses because the latter cannot be hoodwinked anymore, the group stated. By Political Editor"

Officials have been sent to foreign countries for training on how to operate the system, but the implementation has been delayed due to various technical issues. After President Ranil Wickremesinghe took office, he entrusted Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake to take charge of implementing already delayed system. This will come into effect from December as a result of many rounds of discussions,” an official said. Accordingly, this new system will be implemented in consultation with the Ministry of Finance and a data collection network will also be created under this. According to the official, once implemented several authorised persons in the government, including some bureaucrats will be able to check whether this system is working properly from their mobile phone or computer.

He pointed out that the world is facing unprecedented challenges, further exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, adverse climate change effects and escalating conflicts, all of which are impacting both humanity and the planet. Sri Lanka is diligently working to overcome these challenges, emphasised Speaker Abeywardena during his participation in the 147th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Luanda, Angola. The Speaker also highlighted that Sri Lanka faced significant challenges in the past year amid global crises, including social unrest and protests. Nevertheless, the Government and the people of Sri Lanka have ensured a peaceful political transition and the country’s democratic institutions have remained stable. The 147th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, held in Angola from 23 – 27 October, centres around the theme of ‘Parliamentary Action for Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions’. This theme aligns with the 16th out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established in 2015 by the 193-member States of the United Nations, aimed at eradicating global poverty in the coming years. Several MPs including Naleen Bandara Jayamaha, Mohammed Muzammil, Chintaka Amal Mayadunne, and Rajika Wickramasinghe, along with the Secretary-General of Parliament, Kushani Rohanadeera participated in the Assembly."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/28/raising-awareness-on-lead-poisoning/,Raising awareness on lead poisoning,Author not found,0,2023-10-27T20:33:00+00:00," The World Health Organisation (WHO), along with the United Nations Environment Programme, announced that the International Lead Poisoning Prevention Week of Action, would be held in the last week of October every year. Lead Poisoning Prevention Week of Action was from 22 to 28 October 2023. This is the 11th year of this annual endeavour, inaugurated in 2013, which was initiated with the aim of raising awareness among the public, governments, businesses, and all stakeholders related to sources of lead exposure and taking preventive measures. Within the Sri Lankan context, sources of lead exposure could be lead insolvent-based paints, plastic or rubber toys contaminated with lead or toys painted with lead-contaminated paint, porcelain products, school equipment, beauty products, and recycling of lead-acid batteries or car batteries as well as other electronic waste (E-Waste). “Compared to many countries Sri Lanka has a good position on lead content in paint by having most paints in the market below 90 ppm, the standard recommended by the WHO. This was a result of long-term research, advocacy, and awareness carried out by the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ),” Executive Director, CEJ Dilena Pathragoda said. He says on the other hand, there are several paint types in the market today, that are not necessarily included in the legal categorisation of paints such as board paint, fabric paint, wood paint, roofing paint, and some others – therefore we recommend their recognition in the law. “Nonetheless, lead poisoning in the occupational environment is seriously ignored in Sri Lanka. The informal sector workers such as those engaged in lead acid battery manufacturing, recycling, and scrap collectors that handle electronic waste and dismantling them for resource recovery, demolition, renovation, automobile/ radiator repair, plastic/ glass manufacturing, iron/ steel working, welding/soldering work, road construction, lead smelting, propeller engine and aircraft maintenance, are vulnerable to lead exposure. In order to reduce lead poisoning there should be legal provisions and systematic implementation processes in place for these workplaces,” Pathragoda explained. “According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines, the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for lead is 50 µg/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter) of lead over an eight-hour time-weighted-average for all employees. But, does Sri Lanka maintain this standard?” questioned Project planning and management officer, CEJ  Chalani Rubesinghe. She says no data is to be found on the Sri Lankan context of the average blood lead level of our informal sector workers. “The occupational exposure creates pathways for exposure in children as lead-contaminated clothes and soil leading for secondary exposure. It is important that we pay attention to both occupational and environmental exposure pathways of lead,” Rubesinghe added.   Lead Poisoning Prevention Week of Action focuses on raising awareness about health effects of lead exposure, highlighting the efforts of countries and partners to prevent lead exposure, particularly in children and urge further action to eliminate lead paint through regulatory action at country level. In celebrating this Lead poisoning prevention week of action, CEJ demands authorities to take immediate steps to introduce health screen facilities to the informal sector workers, especially for those engaged in occupations with a high exposure risk, for prevention is better than cure.  By Risidra Mendis"

It is also alleged that a top official had obtained gainful employment with the national carrier, after his termination from the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF). But there too, his employment was alleged to have been terminated as a result of the violation of the IT policy with adult online content.  “The aviation industry in Sri Lanka is in danger of being a complete failure as the regulator and so-called competent authority has bungled the entire management of the industry,” the Aircraft Owners and Operators Association stated. They also said, “The domestic aviation industry should have been a winner. The British, after leaving our shores in 1948, strategically distributed a network of airports evenly around the island close to tourist hot spots. “Instead, the Civil Aviation Authority, attempting to show off that it was up to international standards, imposed rules which cannot be complied with by local operators and this gave way to corruption in the industry. An international audit conducted in 2018, clearly stated this fact. “The regulator’s airworthy and operational cadre of officers are unlicensed and unqualified and lack experience which has resulted in the grounding of the industry essentially making it a non-contributor to the national economy. “President Ranil Wickremasinghe regularly emphasised that Sri Lanka should be a SMART economy and a developed country in 2048, but to achieve that target disciplined and industrial experience locally and overseas, are essentials and should be the primary criteria for selecting persons to head such crucial government entities. Singapore has achieved that status in a short span as it has disciplined officers as decision makers.” The domestic operators’ association has recommended to the Secretary a suitable replacement at the earliest as the industry has collapsed.

The decision was communicated by Appeals Court President Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne, during the open Court session on Friday (27).

These remarks were made by Nishantha during a media conference held at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Headquarters on 23 August 2022. Justice Chamath Morais has chosen to withdraw from the hearing of the petition due to his prior involvement in delivering an order remanding Sanath Nishantha, while serving within the judicial jurisdiction of Chilaw.

The respondents have been given until 7 November to file objections. The petition was presented before a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court, comprising Justices Murdhu Fernando, Kumuduni Wickramasinghe and Priyantha Fernando. Furthermore, it was decided that the petition would be considered on 23 November, following a request made by Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias, representing the petitioners. The FR Petition was submitted by three Advanced Level students who requested the postponement of the GCE Advanced Level Examination scheduled to commence on 4 January 2024. They argued that, according to the general examination criteria, students are entitled to 495 days to complete their syllabi. However, due to various factors, including last year’s electricity crisis and daily power cuts, they were only able to study for 300 days. As a result, the petitioning students asserted that they would be at a severe disadvantage if they were required to take the GCE Advanced Level Examination under such circumstances because they couldn’t complete the syllabi of all their subjects. The respondents in the petition include the Minister of Education, Secretary to the Ministry of Education, the Commissioner General of Examinations, and the Attorney General.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/28/musician-claims-hrcsl-failed-him/,Musician claims HRCSL failed him,Author not found,0,2023-10-27T20:31:00+00:00," Following a complaint lodged with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), Dumindu Kadigamuwa, a musician in the Department of Cultural Affairs, lost his job and livelihood and even after almost five years, he is still awaiting a response from the HRCSL regarding his complaint, Ceylon Today learns. The alleged incident occurred on 7 February 2017, when he was reportedly beaten up and assaulted in the office for raising concerns about irregularities and corruption within the department and for opposing their unethical practices. At the time, the head of the department had attempted to influence him to withdraw the case filed at the Cinnamon Gardens Police regarding the beating and harassment. However, Kadigamuwa did not withdraw his complaint, and as a result, he was assaulted and transferred. Over the time Kadigamuwa did not pursue his Police case but believed that the HRCSL would certainly bring justice to him however, he claims that so far, they have also violated his rights by not properly investigating his complaint. Kadigamuwa said, after being transferred, within five days of the first transfer, he was relocated to another position unrelated to his original appointment. These actions were taken because he had spoken out about the corruption involving the top official. In response to these events, he submitted a complaint to the HRCSL on 6 March 2017, outlining all the corruption and irregularities carried out by the director, he alleged. However, on 5 January 2018, he was suspended with ‘No Pay’ claiming that ‘Complaining against her to the HRCSL was an anti-State offence’. The musician lamented that the director not only suspended him from work at the department, but also fired him on 29 November 2019, using the same false accusation, that he had approached the HRCSL. According to the Establishment Code, it needs to conduct formal examination on a matter within one year of first accusation which is violated in his case. Also, the Establishment Code has clearly defined the process of employee transfer but, in his case, since the director needed to take revenge, she violated that as well by transferring me within such shorter periods. In his complaint to the HRCSL Kadigamuwa noted that his dismissal from Public Service, was a consequence of complaining to the HRCSL about the violation of human rights and presenting evidence. Following there being no proper action from the HRCSL, since then, Kadigamuwa approached the new HRCSL Chairperson and reported last year that he was severely harassed by the present and former governments. Kadigamuwa had made four complaints over protection of his human rights at the HRCSL they were in 2017(HRC 844/17), 2018(HRC 231/18), 2019(HRC 1710/19) and 2019 (HRC 139421/19) about his matter in office. However, he alleged that the officials accused him for going to the HRCSL claiming it is an offence. He added that the HRCSL had not even examine his complaints submitted four time and no proper investigation has been initiated. The HRCSL has given a recommendation stating that his human rights have been violated, but not mentioning anything about violating their own Human Rights Act as no action has been taken against the complaint.  The Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission Act Section 19 and Subsections 19.1, 19.2 and 19.3 assures the protection to the witness of the complaint and that has been violated. He alleged that the HRCSL has turned a blind eye and it not providing him any protection or carrying out any investigation regarding his complaint. The HRCSL in 2022, submitted several   recommendations. They recommended that the Respondents have violated Article 12.1 of the Constitution by discriminating against the Complainant in the manner in which the Complainant was assaulted by an employee of the Institution within the premises of the Institution and by transferring only the Complainant. Secondly, according to the disciplinary investigation conducted against the complainant, he has been suspended from work and the complainant has been dismissed according to the final decision of the disciplinary investigation. So, the Public Service Commission has the power to take an appropriate decision if there is any result from the relevant disciplinary investigation. It is suggested to take into account the points mentioned in this recommendation of the HRCSL in making such decisions. However, Kadigamuwa alleged the actions by the HRCSL is insufficient.

On Thursday, the Indian Government said, it was “deeply shocked” and would take up the verdict with Qatari authorities. India’s Foreign Ministry said, in a statement that it was awaiting the detailed judgment and attached “high importance to this case”. “We are in touch with the family members and the legal team, and we are exploring all legal options,” the ministry said, adding that it would not make further comment right now because of the “confidential nature of proceedings of this case”. The statement describes the men as employees of a private company called Al Dahra, but they have been widely reported to be former personnel of the Indian Navy.

At the time of the commencement of the sittings, the Speaker announced to the House that he was deeply concerned over the conduct of the Minister and MP for they both called on public to surround the houses of the members of the Constitutional Council. The Speaker said that calling on the public to surround the residences of Constitutional Council members and agreeing to join such actions was not only unconscionable but also unethical. He said that such conduct could easily be seen as an abuse of Parliamentary Privileges. Speaker Abeywardena underscored that the House would not tolerate such behaviour and he emphasised that the Justice Minister’s attempt to belittle the Constitutional Council reflected poorly on his position. The Speaker also said Minister Rajapakshe and MP Aluthgamage endorsed mob aggression against the Constitutional Council members. “The Minister of Justice chose to make baseless allegations in the House against the Constitutional Council, which were forthwith repeated by Mahindananda Aluthgamage. Both members of the House made reference to the political developments of 2022 and to the demands by the people of Sri Lanka for a ‘system change.’ I would like to remind the Members that the ‘system change’ they asked for was also one in which the people expect their representatives to act honourably, in good faith, with reason and in the best interests of the people. Making baseless allegations against a constitutional body, calling on the people to surround the houses of the members of the Council and most seriously, agreeing to join the people when they surround the houses of the members is unconscionable, unethical and could easily amount to an abuse of your parliamentary privileges. Please be warned that this House will not stand for such conduct. May I also note that it reflects poorly on a Minister of Justice to attempt to belittle the Constitutional Council,” the Speaker said. Meanwhile, Minister of Justice Rajapakshe told Parliament that a member of the Bribery Commission has accepted a bribe for filing legal action against the newly enacted Anti-Corruption Bill. “The bribe has come in the form of a promotion for filing legal action against the Anti-Corruption Bill,” the Minister alleged. He made this remark in response to a ruling by the Speaker. “Also, the members of the Bribery Commission have written to the Constitutional Council, threatening all ten members of the council. How can the members of the Bribery Commission threaten the constitutional council,” the Minister questioned. “We did not have any intention to insult the Constitutional Council,” he also said.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/21/concerns-raised-over-safety-of-immunoglobulin/,Concerns raised over safety of immunoglobulin,Author not found,0,2023-10-20T20:34:00+00:00," Concerns have been raised by the public and several health service trade unions, with regard to the safety and efficacy of the human immunoglobulin 5g – 6g vials, following the controversy it triggered.  President of the Academy of Health Professionals (AHP) Ravi Kumudesh warned on Friday (20) that there was a significant risk of disease transmission from IVIG derived from human plasma if the Human Immunoglobulin (IV IG) injections had been prepared without rigorous screening and a proper purification process.  If not properly processed, it can carry the potential for transmission of various blood-borne pathogens, including:  Hepatitis B and C. “These viruses can be transmitted through contaminated blood or plasma products, he warned. Also poorly processed IV IG could potentially contain HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Virus (AIDS). Though the risk is extremely low, prone diseases like Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) could theoretically be transmitted through contaminated IV IG products. Bacterial Infections like Contaminated IVIG can also transmit bacterial infections if not adequately sterilised during production, the AHP President warned. “It’s crucial to ensure that any IVIG product a patient receives had adhered to strict safety and quality standards, including comprehensive screening and purification processes, in order to minimise these risks. Going by the claims made by Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella the suspiciousness of the transaction regarding the drug heightened with his (the Minister’s) claim that it was substance similar to saline or saline solution. Kumudesh said recollecting said that complaints regarding the drug had been received from the Colombo and Kandy National Hospitals and Matale, Matara General Hospitals. But it is highly intriguing as to how such complaints could have arisen from a saline like drug, he noted. The Association of Medical Specialists raising concerns observed that the IVIG was an expensive drug that was given to patients who were seriously ill. The AMS President noted that Human Immunoglobulin was normally manufactured using plasma obtained from 1000- 10,000 healthy donors under strict quality control methods  to prevent people with certain underlying infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and C contributing to the final product. “As the identity of the manufacturer of this drug is still not known, it is possible that the product may not have undergone all the stringent testing and screening procedures required for manufacturing and thus may potentially be contaminated with HIV and hepatitis B or C viruses,” he cautioned. “If that is the case, these unfortunate patients may be infected with those viruses giving an additional health problem of dreadful infections. These patients could become an infection source to other healthy people in the community creating further health risks. He urged the Health Ministry to find ways of identifying these patients and screen them for possible infection with HIV and hepatitis B. Media Committee Member for the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe, when contacted, said that even during the meeting with the medical professionals in Parliament it had been noted that there still was no clue –even after a lapse of two weeks as to where the particular stock of Human Immunoglobulin had come from. All that can be said is that if this particular drug was really saline at this juncture.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

According to the survey 52.8% of Sri Lankans who had received counselling by chatting with personal from NMHSS were between the age group of 20-29 years, Medical Officer-in-Charge of the ‘1926’ Helpline, Dr. Charith Pathirana said. Dr. Pathirana said, on Friday (20) that the survey carried out in 2020 between April and June had shown that 30% who used the 1926 SMS service and the 0755551926 WhatsApp chat line of the NMHSS were between the age group of 10-19 years. Also 2.2% of those who had used the SMS and chatline of the NMHSS were between the age group of 30-50 years, he noted. The statistics issued during the fifth anniversary of ‘1926’ National Mental Health Support Service (NMHSS). Dr. Pathirana said, that with the launch of the WhatsApp No. 0755551926 in collaboration with a local service provider had facilities of counselling  had been further strengthened as the person in need of help could chat with one of the service personel and build a rapport. It benefitted the youth and those who preferred texting or chatting rather than calling. Also it helps people in need of help communicate with the psychiatrist or get in touch with the NIMH without being identified or stigmatised as a mad person, Dr. Pathirana explained.

However, MP Perera denied the allegation. “I only committed an act of self-defence when Gamage tried to attack me with her handbag,” he said. “We need to safeguard men’s rights as well. Many talk of women’s rights but it looks like action should be taken to safeguard men’s rights as well,” he added. It was reported that the assault was a result of a remark which had been made by MP Rohana Bandara and later Perera had got involved in the brawl with him . A video footage taken by Perera started circulating widely on social media by Friday evening.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/10/14/experts-call-for-immediate-building-classification/,Experts Call for Immediate Building Classification,Author not found,0,2023-10-13T20:36:00+00:00," With concerns being raised whether haphazardly done city beautification and deep excavations of construction sites are posing a threat to wayside ancient trees and old buildings, in the aftermath of tragic tree-bus accident in Kollupitiya that killed five and injured several, experts have insisted on the need for an immediate classification or categorising of older buildings in Colombo, Gampaha, Galle and Matara Districts according to the level of vulnerability or risk. This is in addition to the public document being drafted by the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) in collaboration with the Peradeniya Botanical Garden and several other experts on assessing hazardous trees. Professor of Geology, Atula Senarathna, attached to the Peradeniya University stated that when doing construction, especially in Colombo, it must be done with great care because the whole land on which the city is established is fragile. “It is well known that the whole area of Colombo was a lagoon 4,000-5,000 years ago. The two segments of Beira Lake that we observe even today are the only remnants of that lagoon. Also, the lagoonal areas are clearly visible in aerial photographs or satellite images. The issue with a land which is formulated upon a lagoon is that it is composed of lagoonal sediments of which the prominent is usually clay. Similarly, other areas that are either neighbouring a lagoon in the coastal region or marsh lands, have the same problem as the soil is not very rigid unlike most other parts in the country,” he said. He also said it is difficult to be too confident that Colombo is not affected by the tremors. “There were several severe earthquakes and tremors happening in India including the major quake in Delhi and the one in Afghanistan that happened very recently. So, if these quakes occur in higher magnitudes, of course there is a high tendency for Sri Lanka also to feel the shock. In that case, Colombo also will be vulnerable.” Prof. Senarathna also suggested that the most crucial step to take at this juncture is to categorise or classify the existing building in districts like Colombo, Gampaha, Galle and Matara, according to the level of vulnerability or risk. “Then, we can identify the priorities and take action to rectify them, if possible. There are techniques which can be used to strengthen the foundations of old buildings. The others which cannot be rectified should be used for alternative purposes such as storage, without using them as residences or offices. However, the large construction projects which were carried out in the past ten years were mostly done by foreign companies and the resilience of those can be assured as those companies take the said aspects into serious consideration when constructing a building. Usually, they design the buildings in a way that they can withstand tremors of magnitude up to 3.5 on the Richter scale.” Meanwhile, Director General of NBRO, Eng. (Dr.) Asiri Karunawardena said normally, the approval for those high-rise buildings are rendered by the Urban Development Authority or Local Government Authorities, but when they need a profile for the foundation or deep excavations in the basement; they would refer to the National Building Research Organisation. “So, our main purpose is to prevent any damage that would occur to the adjacent buildings due to these constructions.” He also said there are specific guidelines according to which the technical design of the constructions should be submitted and also there is a vibration limit for excavations.  “There are many instances where these constructions have damaged the old buildings which were structurally unsound. That is why indeed, there are strict precautionary methods to follow when doing a construction. Synonymously, there could be an impact on the large trees too nearby and therefore the attention must be on that as well. Monitoring of the conditions of the large trees in Colombo falls under the Municipal Council’s portfolio, but as an external agency, we are also designing a new guideline to assess the trees in future. It will be official soon,” he added. By Gagani Weerakoon and Induwara Athapattu"

During the challenging year, marked by political upheaval, extended power cuts, and fuel shortages, the financial results for LIOC during the 2022-2023 fiscal year, ending in March were remarkable, with a net profit of Rs 44 billion, despite having only a 12% market share. The remainder of the market share belonged to CEYPETCO. He said, LIOC’s success continued, underscoring the profitability of oil imports and distribution.  With a 12% market share, LIOC generated Rs 44 billion in net profit, while CPC, with nearly 90% market share, also performed well. In the first six months of the year (January to June 2023), CEYPETCO recorded a profit of Rs. 80 billion, contributing to a combined profit of Rs 120 billion. This is in addition to the substantial taxes imposed on oil imports, including Custom Duty, excise duty, PAL, and SSCL at 1.5%, Ratnayake claimed. Last year’s average fuel price was around Rs 40 to 50 a litre, but according to the Minister of Energy, on his tweet, the charge per litre ranged from LPRs 104 LP95 at Rs 126.71 LAD, Rs 80.15 and LSD Rs 103.44 Kerosene Rs 3.02 apart from their profits. These price rangers are mentioned as per 2 October 2023 estimated pricing of imported refined petroleum products. CEYPETCO’s daily fuel consumption is approximately 5 million litres, translating into a daily income of Rs 600 million from taxes for the Government alone. However, the Energy Minister has claimed that they are incurring losses on certain types of fuel. He reported losses of one cent from petrol LP 92, 39 cents from Petrol 95, 51 cents from auto diesel, and 61 cents from super diesel. Nevertheless, it’s suggested that they are not incurring losses, and a 4% profit margin per liter, equivalent to Rs 14.56 cents, has been noted for CPC, which employs 3,000 workers. In contrast, LIOC, with only 300 workers and lower administrative costs, manages to achieve a high profit margin. Furthermore, LOLC distributes 60,000 to 70,000 litres of fuel daily, which is 10% of CPC’s five million, approximately one million litres. The profit generated and the taxes collected by the government from LIOC come from public funds, he added. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

This delay has led to criticism of the Committee over postponing the approval of certain Gazettes. However, the blame for these delays lies with the Ministry, which frequently submits Gazettes late, leaving the Committee with insufficient time for proper analysis and consideration. The Committee firmly instructed the Ministry officials to ensure the prompt submission of Gazettes intended for consideration, without unnecessary delay, expressing strong dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs. These issues were discussed during a recent meeting of the Committee on Public Finance in Parliament, chaired by Dr. Harsha de Silva. During the meeting, the Committee deliberated on and approved a Resolution under the Customs Ordinance, two Orders under the Excise Ordinance, and three orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act No. 13 of 1989. The Committee reevaluated the Resolutions under the Customs Ordinance, specifically Gazette Extraordinary No. 2336/72 dated 16 June 2023. It was noted that ‘soap noodles’ were being imported for soap production, with some companies importing palm oil fatty acids. Due to the introduction of a new Customs duty of 24% on palm fatty acids, certain companies started importing palmitic and lauric acids at lower tax rates to produce soap noodles. To maintain price equality in the market and prevent revenue loss, the Committee proposed imposing a new tax of 29% on these substituted acids, which would now fall under a new HS code. Although there were concerns about policy inconsistency, as a general rule, lower taxes are applied to raw materials compared to finished or semi-finished products, the Gazette introducing the new HS codes for these derivatives was ultimately approved by the Committee on Public Finance upon further review. Meanwhile, when reviewing the Orders under the Excise Ordinance, the Committee engaged in an extensive discussion about the prevalence of counterfeit stickers on bottles of liquor and the substantial loss of tax revenue due to 40% of alcohol in the market featuring counterfeit stickers. The Committee pointed out that, since this issue was first brought up during the Committee on Ways and Means, various raids had been conducted, resulting in a sudden revenue increase of two billion rupees within two weeks for the Excise Department. As a result, the Committee decided to further address this matter during a joint meeting with the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA). Additionally, the Committee questioned officials about the absence of Court cases filed to date to address such illicit activities. Dr. Harsha also expressed concerns about the procurement contract for digital stickers, as there was a notable price discrepancy. A digital sticker costs only 0.20 cents, while the Government is paying the contractor Rs 1.90 per sticker, resulting in an overpayment. Officials explained that the contract was originally made for physical stickers, and no amendments were made when stickers were digitalised."

Athuraliye Rathana Thera, from the ‘Ape Jana Bala Pakshaya’ (Our Power of People Party/ OPPP) is not legally valid. The verdict was delivered during the hearing of a petition filed by Rathana Thera. The Bench comprised Justices Buwaneka Aluvihare, Janak de Silva, and Murdu Fernando. The political party’s disciplinary committee had announced Rathana Thera’s removal from the party in a letter dated 15 October 2021. The lawyer for the petitioner argued in Court that the OPPP’s disciplinary committee did not have the authority to take disciplinary action against his client, citing an agreement between Rathana Thera and the OPPP as the head of the organisation known as ‘Vijaya Dharani Jathika Sabawa.’ After considering the arguments presented in Court, the Bench concluded that the OPPP’s decision to expel Rathana Thera from the political party was unlawful and thus overturned the OPPP’s decision.

JCPSM President, Ravi Kumudesh noted on Friday (13), that ten days had lapsed since the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) had been called to probe the alleged scam. But the relevant company had not even been summoned for questioning as yet, he alleged noting that it was evident that within next few days the public will be informed that responsible parties had fled the country. “It is not known as to whether the Pharmaceutical Company carried out this scam singlehandedly,” he said noting that under these circumstances the company which was being faulted for alleged fraud was more of an asset at present than being identified as a crook. The JCPSM President said, the relevant party could be used to disclose the information they know, making it possible to expose the number of corrupt acts taking place at the National Drug Regulatory Authority (NMRA). Therefore, it is the responsibility of the government and health authorities to prevent the owners of the company from leaving the country. Kumudesh pointed out that the particular pharmaceutical company had been supplying medicines within Sri Lanka since 2021. It has also quite openly manufactured medicinal drugs. Now the NMRA claims that it had not given permission to manufacture medicinal drugs. “What is the purpose of having a Drug Regulatory Authority if an unauthorised pharmaceutical manufacturer could produce drugs quite openly and supply the State,” he queried. The JCPSM President queried further as to whether the suspicions of the State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC) and the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) had not peaked when they noted that the rubber stamp had the qualifications placed over the title. Generally, the Sri Lankan Customs do not release a stock of medicine (or any other goods) sans online confirmation. It would be interesting to note from those at the NMRA who are hung on a letter as to whether or not the Customs had asked for such a confirmation from them or not, he pointed out.

The FATF delegation, the global policy setter on AML/CFT, that grey-listed Sri Lanka from FATF’s Compliance Document twice in the past, is expected to visit Sri Lanka in 72 weeks to assess the AML/CFT of Sri Lanka.  It is assessed that Sri Lanka’s AML/CFT effectiveness is at ‘low level’.  Even Terrorist financing and preventive measures and financial sanctions, PF financial sanctions, money-laundering investigation and prosecution are at ‘low level’. One of the 24 institutions, from which the action plans were requested by the FIU, is the Attorney General’s (AG) Department.

The Police have been asked to streamline the existing Money Laundering investigation structure within the CID/Police under a dedicated senior DIG. Also, they have requested for the drafting of the Mutual Legal Assistance, which is an integral part of an investigation. It is extremely important to have experienced officers to perform this task. Thirdly, the Police are asked to maintain continuous consultation with Attorney General’s Department on investigations of complex cases and also to formulate a coordination mechanism and establish a task forces with domestic agencies in conducting complex Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing investigations. Also, the FIU asked that steps be taken to prioritise and speed-up investigations and also to enhance investigators’ knowledge and skills on Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing investigations as well as maintain comprehensive statistics.

Issuing a statement, the PMD said concerns have been expressed regarding a recent editorial in the Gnanartha Pradeepaya newspaper, published today, (Sunday, 8 October), as well as a news report advocating for the establishment of an “international investigation team” to conduct an impartial, transparent, and comprehensive inquiry. On 20 April, Tiran Alles, the Minister of Public Security, took the initiative to submit the full PCoI report, comprising 88 volumes and 48,909 pages, to Bishop Harold Anthony. The PMD said, a recent telephone conversation between Minister Alles and the Chairman of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference, Bishop Harold Anthony, revealed that Bishop Anthony is personally reviewing the contents of this comprehensive report. In response to these developments, President Ranil Wickremesinghe is now preparing to engage in discussions with representatives of the Bishops’ Conference, the PMD said. It is important to note that the government does not endorse the concept of international investigations into Sri Lanka’s internal matters. The country’s constitutional framework and existing legal provisions do not allow for international investigations, rendering such initiatives legally incompatible and in violation of national laws. In response to the concerns raised, the government has established a committee led by a retired Supreme Court Judge. This committee will conduct an in-depth inquiry and produce a comprehensive report, with a particular focus on the Channel 4 documentary. The PMD has reiterated its dedication to upholding the rule of law and maintaining the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. The government is committed to addressing pertinent issues through established legal channels, ensuring transparency and adherence to the nation’s laws, the PMD concluded."

The tree collapsed onto the SLTB bus bound for Deniyaya, which was travelling along the Duplication Road, near the Liberty Junction. The injured passengers were promptly transported to the National Hospital Colombo. Subsequently, Duplication Road was temporarily closed to traffic, and motorists were advised to use alternate routes. At about 11.30 a.m. Duplication Road was reopened for vehicular traffic following the successful removal of the tree that had obstructed the roadway. Furthermore, in line with the directives of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Presidential Secretary Saman Ekanayake issued instructions to the Transport Ministry and the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) to provide financial assistance or support as needed to the families of the deceased. According to rough evaluations the tree could be 40 years old. Director of Land Affairs Department of Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Eng. K. Ramesh said, a programme has been put in place to fell the trees within the CMC limits that are in bad condition and pose threat to the public. Eng. Ramesh said, the lack of coordination between the CMC and National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) which had undertaken excavations on the roadside to lay new pipelines and the Sri Lanka Telecom that lays telephone cables, could be the cause of such tragic incidents. While expressing concerns over the tragedy, Eng. Ramesh said, if the authorities concerned with the provision of utility service, provided exact information to them, such tragedies can be prevented. Meanwhile, a total of 37 individuals, including schoolchildren, suffered injuries in two separate head-on collisions in Kuliyapitiya and Nittambuwa, on the same day (6).

The meeting was held at the Public Security Ministry premises. The representatives had pointed out that due to the Government having tabled the OSB in the House in undue haste there had not been recourse for a sufficient discussion on it with requisite stakeholders in society. They were of the view that if the OSB were to be ratified in Parliament and if it became law, it could sound the death knell to the freedom of expression by the masses. The representatives had emphasised that the decision taken by the political authority to entrust the task of overseeing the content published on various social media platforms to a Commission appointed by them would also suppress freedom of expression and stifle dissent. Minister Alles for his part had opined that the submission of the OSB in Parliament had been the culmination of a process which had been underway since 2016 and had noted that it had been drafted by the Law Commission which had functioned under two Justice Ministers. Alles had explained that the Cabinet had entrusted him the job of tabling the said Bill in the House and had maintained that the OSB would go a long way towards addressing issues facing children and women in society and providing relief to them after such segments had lodged a spate of complaints regarding acts of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, intimidation, tarnishing of image in public etc. The Minister had further assured the representatives that suggestions and proposals mooted by them will also be considered by the Government towards incorporation in the OSB as and when possible. He added that he will also be seeking views in this regard from several other organisations such as the Asia Internet Coalition, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), foreign missions, civil society groups and media outlets etc. Public Security Ministry Secretary Viyani Gunathilaka and representatives from the Sri Lanka Press Institute (SLPI), the Free Media Movement (FMM), Factum institute, the Social Media Coalition and the Media Law Forum participated in the meeting.  "

On Thursday (5), the Socialist Youth Union (SYU) requested a declaration that the Online Safety Bill, which was tabled in Parliament by the Government, violates the Constitution. The Petition, filed by SYU President Eranga Gunasekara, listed the Attorney General as a respondent and argued that the Bill infringes upon fundamental rights, particularly freedom of speech and expression as guaranteed by the Constitution. As a remedy, the petitioner seeks a Court Order stipulating that for the Bill to pass, it must receive approval from both a two-thirds majority in Parliament and a referendum. Sri Lanka Working Journalist Association (SLWJA), also filed a petition challenging the Bill on Tuesday (3). Particularly, the SLWJA raised concerns in the petition about the composition of the Online Safety Commission, noting that it lacks the independence required for regulating electronic media, a crucial platform for influencing thought. Furthermore, the powers granted to the Commission under Clause 11 of the Bill are vague, overbroad, arbitrary, capricious, and may amount to the exercise of judicial power. As such, the SLWJA argued that these powers violate multiple articles of the Constitution. Social activist and independent journalist Tharindu Uduwaragedara submitted a petition on Tuesday (3), while General Secretary of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), MP Ranjith Maddumabandara, along with SJB’s Rehan Jayawickrema and Freedom People’s Congress (FPC) member Prof. G.L. Peiris filed another petitition on Wednesday (4). The Online Safety Bill was presented to Parliament by Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles on 3 October. The Bill has generated significant controversy due to concerns about certain contentious provisions. This Bill, published in the Government Gazette on 18 September, aims to regulate online communication, prevent the misuse of online accounts, identify and declare online locations used for prohibited purposes, and address issues related to the dissemination of false information, among other matters. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) recently urged the government to revise the recently gazetted Online Safety Bill, making seven recommendations. In a letter addressed to Minister Alles, the HRCSL has revealed its preliminary observations and recommendations on the Bill. The HRCSL in the latter said the general observations and recommendations are presented for consideration in view of revising the Bill to ensure compatibility with the fundamental rights Chapter of the Sri Lankan Constitution.

He firmly asserted that no one should deter those who advocate for the people’s rights. He continued, “The Secretary of the Defence Ministry and the Army Commander responded menacingly during a Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security meeting, when I brought up the issue of high-ranking military officials’ vehicle usage. Their behaviour was bullying, both within the committee and in Parliament itself. When I asked them whether they would attack me for my concerns, they said they could do it, in very threatening manner. Furthermore, the Defence Ministry Secretary persistently made threatening calls to me. This incident constitutes a violation of my privileges as an MP, and I request a thorough investigation and immediate action to be taken.” He further elaborated on discussions within the Sectoral Oversight Committee regarding the downsizing of the Army, suggesting that instead of reducing the number of soldiers, attention should be directed towards curbing unnecessary expenditures by high-ranking officials, including the Defence Ministry Secretary. “What I said during the committee meeting was even ministers now exercise prudence in spending, deserving respect for their responsible financial behaviour,” he said. Weerakkody expressed astonishment at the alleged extravagant spending, claiming that the current allocation of Rs 80 million for the construction of the garden of the Army Commander’s official residence. “I call for an end to such expenditures. I also have information about what this Defence Ministry Secretary does when he goes to attend the board meeting of the Civil Aviation Authority. Before his arrival to the board meeting, a group of fifteen individuals inspects the premises. Who pays for these things? When we speak against these things, they threaten us.” “Also, this Defence Ministry Secretary goes for jogging to Independence Square in the mornings. While he is jogging two soldiers go ahead of him with two dogs. After him a jeep and another vehicle follow. What is the origin of the funding for such arrangements? The public blames all the 225 MPs for this excessive expenditure. I can remember another incident. This Defence Ministry Secretary came for an event in a temple in my electorate, Baddegama, where an extravagant entourage arrived before him, making it difficult even to conduct almsgiving for the Buddhist clergy,” he alleged. Weerakkody requested the Deputy Speaker, who was presiding over the sittings, to take steps to protect the video recording of the said committee meeting. Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake also requested the Deputy Speaker to ensure the protection of the recordings of the meeting. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

According to official reports, a total of 9,448 individuals from 2,350 families across 16 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in the Matara District have been impacted by these disasters, with devastating consequences. Among the affected families, 399 houses have sustained partial damage, and an additional 37 properties have been affected to varying degrees. The situation has escalated to the point where 6,967 families, comprising 25,553 individuals, are presently stranded due to the catastrophic floods. Owing to this situation, schools in the district were forced to close on Thursday (5) and Friday (6). In response to this dire situation, community food processing centres have been set up in key areas, including Malimbada, Akurassa, Kamburupitiya, and Thihagoda, to provide essential meals to those in need. Additionally, the Sri Lanka Army has taken swift action to aid the stranded population, actively engaging in providing cooked food to alleviate their immediate hunger. Under the leadership of Major General Janaka Ranasinghe, Commander of the 61st Infantry Division, and Colonel Roshan Kannangara, Commander of Matara, two Army battalions have been deployed to spearhead relief efforts.

According to a senior officer of the NCPA, this predicament has arisen primarily because many regional child protection officers have left their positions to pursue opportunities in the public service, citing dissatisfaction with their present roles. The senior official pointed out that the primary cause for this exodus is the failure of the Department of Management Services to approve the NCPA’s requests to raise the salary category of these officers. Further, there have been calls from subject experts and some officials within the authority to place the National Child Protection Authority directly under the supervision of the President, as it was during its inception. A representative from the trade union at NCPA expressed disappointment that promises made by the former Chairman of the NCPA, Prof. Muditha Vidanapathirana, regarding meetings with division heads and the implementation of a system for monthly suggestions and comments from trade unions, remain unfulfilled. The resignations of the child protection officers have placed additional burdens on the remaining officers, requiring them to cover more jurisdictions. The original purpose of establishing the authority was to formulate policies to prevent child abuse and protect children who had fallen victim to such abuse. However, after two decades, the Auditor General submitted a special audit report, revealing that the authority had failed to effectively implement this policy. During the audit, it was noted that out of a total of 79,259 complaints received over nine years, 42,075 remained unresolved, and a staggering 55 per cent of the complaints submitted to the Attorney General went unprosecuted. The Auditor General’s department identified several reasons for the lack of investigation into these complaints during sample inspections, with one of the primary factors being insufficient transportation allowances that hindered officials from conducting on-site inspections. Following these revelations, in 2021, 18 proposals were submitted to the higher-ups of the NCPA by the National Child Protection Authority Employees’ Union on three key themes. Despite these limitations, the senior officer who spoke to Ceylon Today emphasised that the majority of child protection officers who continue to serve are dedicated to their roles and urged higher authorities to address this pressing matter urgently.

Dr. Sanjeewa alleged that Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry, Dr. Saman Ratnayake had also been duped by the tender submission of the pharmaceutical company for the purchase of those medicines. A significant part of the amount had been paid by Health Secretary, Janaka Sri Chandragupta, he claimed. The MCPA President warned that a complaint would also be lodged with the CID regarding the incident. Dr. Sanjeewa explained that 22,500 vials of immunoglobulin injection imported from India under the waiver of registration of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) had been withdrawn after patients in four State Hospitals islandwide, had shown adverse reactions. The stock had been withdrawn as a result, he said. Medical practitioners from National Hospitals Kandy and Colombo and District General Hospital Matale and Matara where the medication was used complained of the adverse reaction in patients after administering the injection.

One of the primary obstacles hindering livestock production in Sri Lanka has been the scarcity of animals suited for specific agricultural purposes. Currently, the nation heavily relies on import of cows and goats for meat and milk production. Tragically, many of these imported animals perish due to their inability to acclimatise to the country’s climate and vulnerability to various diseases. Minister Amaraweera recognised the urgency of this situation and has advised the Department of Animal Production and Health to launch research initiatives aimed at introducing two distinct breeds of cattle and goats ideally suited for Sri Lanka. The goal is to significantly boost domestic milk and meat production. Officials from the Department of Animal Production and Health have revealed that such research typically spans five to seven years. However, they are already making headway by exploring the potential of a new cattle breed, using white cattle from the Eastern Province. Additionally, ongoing investigations are focused on the Kottukachchiya goat species, which originates from the Kottukachchiya farm. Sri Lanka’s demand for beef stands at an estimated 37,000 metric tons per day, with the majority being imported. Moreover, only 40 per cent of the country’s milk needs are met locally, while the remaining 60 per cent is sourced through imports. The scarcity of technology and cattle breeds capable of yielding higher milk production poses a significant challenge to farmers. Minister Amaraweera stressed that had the livestock sector initiated this project five years ago, the nation could have already produced cattle and goat breeds tailored to Sri Lanka’s conditions. However, the lack of proactive steps has resulted in continued reliance on imported milk and meat. To address these pressing concerns, the minister urged the immediate commencement of research efforts to identify two distinct cattle and goat species that can thrive in Sri Lanka’s climate.

Letters have been circulated, instructing that the all assets associated with the Sathosa, including the two paddy mills situated in Pannegamuwa and Higurakgoda, the Nuwara Eliya Resort, and the head office buildings, be transferred to designated officials. However, due to vehement opposition from employees, these officials have been unable to carry out their duties thus far. Requests to surrender keys to various properties, such as the generator room at the Sathosa Head Office, the main electrical circuit room, the door connecting the 8th and 9th floors, and the two paddy mills in Pannegamuwa and Higurakgoda, as well as the Nuwara Eliya Resort, have been met with employee protests and refusals to comply. Despite officials appointed by Lanka Sathosa being prepared to receive these keys, they have been forced to retreat in the face of employee objections. Consequently, due to the inability to open the old locks of the generator room, electrical circuit room and the door between the eighth and ninth floors in Sathosa’s Main Office, measures have been taken to replace them with new locks and station new security personnel at these locations.

Saravanarajah, who presided over the case related to Kurunthumalai Temple. The President has given this order because the Judge resigned without notifying the Police or the Judicial Service Commission of the threats he received. Consequently, the President has ordered an immediate investigation into the root causes of this incident. Accordingly, Ekanayake has discussed the matter with Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles. It was reported that during the discussions it has been revealed that the Magistrate had not previously lodged any complaint about the death threats. The Judge reportedly left the country on 24 September and submitted his resignation letter to the Judicial Service Commission on the previous day (23 September). The President’s Secretary also inquired from the Attorney General about the allegations made by the Judge against him. The Attorney General stated that he discussed legal matters with the Judge in his office, following a request, made through the Judicial Service Commission to represent the latter in a case assigned to the Court of Appeal. This discussion took place in the presence of three senior lawyers from the Attorney General’s Department. The Attorney General emphasised that during the meeting it was decided that it was wrong to name the Judge as a respondent in the case. Additionally, intelligence services have reported to the President’s Office that the Judge had close interactions with officials from several embassies recently. Considering all these factors, the President has ordered an investigation to determine whether this is a genuine threat or if it resembles a situation akin to a ‘Channel 4’ allegation."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/30/mullaitivu-district-judges-sudden-resignation-creates-controversy/,Mullaitivu District Judge’s sudden resignation creates controversy,Author not found,0,2023-09-29T20:33:00+00:00,"Following the sudden release of the resignation letter of Mullaitivu District Judge T. Saravanarajah on social media platforms and the subsequent ‘racial’ narration given to it with the incident going viral, many parties have raised concerns whether it was another asylum-seeking bid at the expense of the country’s image. Judge Saravanaraja, in his letter of resignation dated 23 September, addressed to the Secretary, Judicial Services Commission, stated he wished to resign from all his posts including post of District Judge, Magistrate, Family Court Judge, Primary Court Judge, Small Claims Court Judge and post of Juvenile Court Judge, alleging life threats and lots of pressure. However, he appeared to have given statements to regional Tamil correspondents which have been now circulated on social media platforms indicating that life threats and undue pressure was exerted on him due to the judgement he gave on the Kurunthamalai archaeological site. Several websites and social media posts even suggested that the Attorney General pressured him to reverse the orders. The Attorney General’s Department meanwhile, has vehemently denied allegations made on certain social media platforms, purportedly quoting Judge Saravanaraja, claiming that he had been compelled by the AG to reverse the orders the latter had issued in the Kurunthamalai case. A post on X (formerly known as Twitter) supposedly quoting Judge Saravanaraja, stated, “Constant pressure was applied by the Government to reverse the orders I had issued in Kurunthoornalai [sic] case. “Members of Parliament such as @ReAdSarath and others belonging to the majority community have issued threats against my life, both in Parliament as well as outside it. “The Police protection afforded to me (the Judge) was recently reduced, whilst the intelligence officers continued to surveil [sic] me. “The Attorney General invited me (Judge) to meet him in his office on 21 September and during the meeting he compelled me to reverse the orders that I had issued in the Kurundurmalai [sic] case. “Moreover, two cases have been filed against me personally in the Court of Appeal in connection with the Kurunthoormalai [sic] case. “I have had to resign from all my much beloved judicial posts due to life threats, pressures and harassments that I have been subjected to since delivering the order. The above said are just a handful of examples of the threats, pressures and harassments I received.” However, the Attorney General’s Department stated that certain matters in the above narrative contain gross inaccuracies. Accordingly, they stated, the Judge is the First Respondent in three Writ Applications; 474, 482 and 528 of 2023. He has been named personally, whereby his several orders are sought to be quashed and make mala fides levelled against him. In total, there are seven Writ Applications filed, and apart from Judge Saravanaraja, his predecessor Judge has also been named as a Respondent challenging his order made when the latter was the Mullaitivu Magistrate. The AG’s Department also said, a written request was made by Judge Saravanaraja through the Judicial Service Commission to the Attorney General to safeguard his interest in the above-named cases. They added that pursuant to his request, a consultation was held with the Judge in the AG’s Chambers with the participation of three Senior Counsels who are handling these cases. Being a Judge, courtesies were extended to him to have the consultation in the Attorney General’s Chambers. The AG’s Department stressed that it has to be noted that the Judge attended this consultation as a client meeting his lawyers, as per the fiduciary relationship. Notwithstanding the fact that he is a Judge, he was a client as he was named Respondent in three Applications. The Department emphasised that he was not summarily summoned, and that the meeting took place pursuant to his written request. At the meeting, there was no pressure exerted on him and it was very cordial. The Judge gave instructions and various issues were discussed. It was stressed by the Counsels that the Court of Appeal will be apprised that the practice of naming sitting judges as Respondents should be eschewed and the Judge should be discharged. Without prejudice to the above, various other legal issues were discussed, to which the Judge agreed. Since the matters are subjudice, it is inappropriate to discuss advice given to a Client by his Lawyer. However, the submissions to be made to the Court of Appeal were made known to him. They stressed that at no stage was any pressure exerted on the Judge to change his orders. The Attorney General could have taken the path of least resistance and refused to appear for the Judge and asked him to retain his own Counsel. Such a course of action was not followed, but they acted on his instructions and advised him on the proposed submissions that were to be made in the Court of Appeal, the AG’s Department stated. On the other hand, Judge Saravanaraja’s resignation appears to be a part of a well-thought-out plan to seek asylum in a foreign country by painting the country in a negative light.  According to highly placed sources, the Judge had already decided to leave the country. A few days before he sent his letter of resignation via registered post, he sold his car to another Magistrate stating that he wanted to buy a new car. Also, according to HQI Mullaitivu, Judge Saravanaraja had come to Colombo on 23 September in a hired van with his Personal Security Officer (PSO). Thereafter, he had got in touch with the PSO on 27 September, and told him that he was in India and had asked the PSO to report back to Mullaitivu Police. It is reliably learnt that Judge Saravanaraja had departed the country on 24 September, on Air Arabia flight G9 503 at 3:08 a.m. Reportedly, Judge Saravanaraja is presently in Switzerland. "

He appealed to the public on Friday (22), not to be overcome by undue fear despite reports of the viral infection, which had claimed the lives of two of the six infected cases of the bat-borne virus Nipah, in the South Indian State of Kerala India. Dr. Gunawardena, noted that the zoonotic disease had not affected the island nation and that thereby people should not be seized by an undue fear. In 2001 and 2018 the disease was detected in Bangladesh where it reached epidemic proportions.  However, up to now no cases of the viral infection have been detected amongst Sri Lankans, he noted adding that the public should not to fear it like the Covid-19 viral infection.   Acting Director Epidemiology Unit, Dr. Samitha Ginige noted that the zoonotic viral infection was not new and that it had first been identified in the late 1990’s in Malaysia. “Back in Sri Lanka we will keep a watchful eye on any new developments of the infection,” he reassured. He noted that symptoms of the virus occurred between four and 14-days following exposure, they included fever followed by headache, cough, sore throat, difficulty in breathing and nausea. Virology Expert, Medical Research Institute (MRI), Dr. Janaki Abeynayake, noted that the carriers of the virus were bats. It was released into the environment through bat secretions. “Bats eat fruits and attempt to drink toddy from pots during the night. If a person consumes a fruit eaten by an infected bat, he or she too, can contract the viral infection, she warned If pigs are exposed to secretions of bats, they too, can get this infection, she further explained. As a result, the Nipah virus could also come out with secretions from pigs.  She urged the public to refrain from consuming pork if pigs were known to be sick. She also warned that people should avoid eating fruits bitten by bats to avoid contracting this virus. Fruits should be washed well before consumption. When giving fruits to young children, parents should take measures to wash them well. Also, refrain from consuming damaged fruits, Dr. Abeynayake appealed.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/23/no-feasibility-studies-conducted-prior-to-construction-case-study/,No feasibility studies conducted prior to construction – Case Study,Author not found,0,2023-09-22T20:34:00+00:00," A new case study of the Nuwara Eliya District highlights significant challenges in the new houses provided for plantation families and has uncovered the absence of individual survey plans, leading to ambiguity regarding property boundaries and the absence of comprehensive feasibility studies for each house.  The new report, ‘Socio-Economic Study on Current Estate Housing and Land Distribution Programme of the Government of Sri Lanka: A Case Study of Nuwara Eliya District’ by Dr R. Ramesh, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Political Science of the University of Peradeniya, was submitted to the Movement for Land and Agricultural Reform (MONLAR) at an event held in Colombo last week. The case study also points out that there is lack of ownership to the deeds, raising concerns about their long-term property rights and security. The case study also points out that there is inadequate land size per housing unit which is often limited to just seven perches and may not be sufficient to meet the needs of the families residing there. The report also notes that there is discrimination in distributing land compared to other provinces. It is also pointed out that the families have limited livelihood opportunities and there are few opportunities for residents to earn a livelihood within or near the housing schemes. Also the estate managements show reluctance in land allocation and that has exacerbated issues related to overcrowding and housing shortages. The report also cites that a proper drainage infrastructure is not in place and poses challenges related to waterlogging and other associated problems, affecting the overall living conditions. And there are also neglected retaining structure facilities like retaining walls that have not received adequate attention, potentially compromising the housing schemes’ infrastructure and safety. The case study shows that these issues were repeatedly mentioned in both interviews and focus group discussions and not only the new householders, but also the entire community is very vigilant about these issues. Further, criticism was levelled against the method of selecting beneficiaries, where party and trade union politics continue to be a key factor in determining householders. Similarly, householders are not very much happy about the material used for the construction and they are skeptical about the quality – they have a strong feeling that the PHDT is a corrupt entity and the housing construction should not be carried out by them, as it diminishes the durability of the new houses. Moreover, incomplete estate houses are handed over to beneficiaries where they have to spend money for the completion of the floor, skim coat, ceiling, painting, fixing sink, pavements and so forth – this becomes a burden to householders. The absence of people’s participation is also a major criticism levelled against the new housing schemes. Very importantly, these drawbacks are not only limited to the housing projects implemented during the Good Governance Government, all these can be equally applied to all the housing programmes implemented since the mid-1990s. Hence, the study explicates that future housing programmes should pay grave concern on the above flaws aiming at ensuring sustainability and minimum standards of housing programmes stipulated by national and international human rights and legal instruments. Similarly, the future housing project should also align with the Sustainable Development Goals, the report stated. Also, there are mixed perception concerning the size of the rooms and other amenities in the new houses – some are happy with what is provided, while there are also grievances and criticisms in this regard. A few householders noted that they had more facilities in the line room than that of the current place, namely, they pointed out the number of rooms, the extent of the house, home garden and so forth. The residents also revealed the grievances among kids – they have a feeling of loneliness and loss of friends, playing, and other engagements with friends and neighbouring houses.  These drawbacks need immediate attention and the ministry can come up with a plan based on priorities. Based on the empirical evidence and analysis, the study proposes the following recommendations to address the flows, challenges, and barriers of the new housing in a manner to ensure sustainability and housing rights. Currently 68% of the plantation community continues to live in line rooms. During the period between 1984 and 2014, 37,000 houses were built in tea and rubber plantations. It only averages to 912 houses per year. By 2015 plantations had accounted for 244,500 families and 966,700 people and 160,000 houses in the plantations were in debilitated conditions and beyond repair. 44% of the people living in the plantations have been living in line rooms smaller than 500 square feet in size. Studies have uncovered various issues on the legality of the deeds awarded and other problems in documents as well. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Supreme Court on 21 March issued an Interim Order suspending the operation of elephant trench projects and the digging of elephant trenches in wildlife national parks, after considering a Fundamental Rights Petition filed by the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ). The Supreme Court granted leave to proceed with the petition and fixed the petition for argument on Friday (22). The CEJ had filed this petition, naming the State Minister of Wildlife Protection, the Director General of Wildlife Conservation, the Central Environmental Authority, the Inspector General of Police, the Attorney General, and several others as respondents. When the petition was taken up for hearing on Friday (22), the Court questioned the Director General of the Department of Wildlife Conservation on whether the trenches project could be stopped completely. However, the Attorney General’s Department, appearing on behalf of the Director General, responded that they did not have a firm opinion on that matter. The petitioners told Court that the said project is an illegal one and it violates the provisions in the National Environmental Act. They also said, illegal sand mining happens under the guise of this project, without obtaining licences from the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) and paying royalty to the government. The Department of Wildlife Conservation and Department of Forest Conservation requested more time for preparations and thus, the Supreme Court extended the Interim Order. The Supreme Court Bench comprised Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Priyantha Fernando and Yasantha Kodagoda. Attorney-at-Law Parinda Ranasinghe appeared on behalf of the respondents, while Attorneys-at-Law Ravindranath Dabare and Savanthi Ponnamperuma, instructed by Attorney-at-Law Samadhi Hansani appeared for the petitioners. The petition stated that, under the pretext of human-elephant conflict mitigation, trenches are being proposed to facilitate natural resource extraction from protected areas and soil and sand smuggling. The digging of trenches has already commenced at the Udawalawa National Park and Lunugamwehera National Park with plans for trenches to be dug along electric fence lines without any feasibility study, EIA, climate impact assessment, archaeological impact assessment, or recommendations by the relevant experts, the petition stated. Further, the petition stated that it is reported that large-scale sand smuggling operations are being conducted under the guise of digging trenches for wild elephants in the Manampitiya and Karapola Reserves, on the border of the Flood Plains National Park, which is under the management of the Department of Wildlife Conservation, while the trenches in wildlife landscapes impede the movement of all wildlife.

This decision was reached during a discussion chaired by President’s Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake, attended by officials from the relevant fields. Additionally, two other policies, one focused on environmental concerns and another on drug prevention, have been introduced in response to current needs. Regarding vehicle imports, several factors will be taken into consideration, including the country’s foreign exchange status, traffic congestion, environmental impacts, and the expansion of the country’s vehicle assembly facilities. The committee responsible for this will also explore the possibility of implementing a quality certification system for vehicles, similar to the existing one in Singapore. The environmental policy committee will develop a protection programme addressing issues like deforestation and mineral resource diversion. To support this effort, the government is exploring the acquisition of drone technology and seeking the assistance of Security Forces. In addition to these initiatives, the government has decided to collaborate with the Ministry of Public Security in formulating drug prevention policies. This committee will also work on combating the large-scale smuggling of drugs into the country."

The motion, presented by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, was passed in Parliament on Friday (22). In his presentation of the motion, the Opposition Leader highlighted several points. Firstly, he noted that MP Ali Sabri Raheem, representing the Puttalam District, is currently under investigation by the Committee on Ethics and Privileges of Parliament, due to alleged misconduct. Secondly, he pointed out that the involvement of this particular MP in parliamentary committees has created issues concerning the behaviour of MPs. In the light of these concerns, Parliament has decided that Ali Sabri Raheem should not participate in any parliamentary committees until the ongoing investigation is concluded. Additionally, the Opposition Leader raised concerns about the disparity in fines for illegal activities. He noted that only a fine of Rs 7.5 million rupees was slapped on the Member of Parliament for illegally importing 3.3 kg of gold valued at Rs 74 million and 41 smartphones worth Rs 4.2 million. In contrast, a fine of Rs 70 million was levied on a Frenchman for smuggling a similar amount of gold worth Rs 80 million. As a result, he called for an investigation into the leniency of the fine imposed on Ali Sabri Raheem."

This is the first time the Government officially made such a revelation about ‘Abu Hindh’ and ‘Sonic Sonic’. Minister Tennakoon, participating in the adjournment debate, on the controversial Channel 4 documentary on the terror attack, unveiled new information regarding two mysterious code names that have baffled both the nation and Parliament since the attack: ‘Sonic Sonic’ and ‘Abu Hindh’. Minister Tennakoon began by explaining that ‘Sonic’ was, in fact, an intelligence officer who infiltrated the terror cell led by Zaharan Hashim. This courageous operative successfully extracted crucial information vital to national security, operating undercover among the extremists as one of their own, the minister said. In a separate revelation, Tennakoon disclosed that ‘Abu Hindh’ was a pseudonym used by an International Intelligence Agency to establish contact with the extremist group led by Zaharan. This alias played a crucial role in extracting intelligence and thwarting potential future attacks. “These intelligence officers demonstrated exceptional skill and bravery by infiltrating terrorist networks, gathering vital information and ensuring the safety of our nation. We owe them a debt of gratitude,” Tennakoon said. He emphasised the importance of these covert operations and urged Parliament to avoid politicising them and expressed concern about the potential repercussions such actions could have on the willingness of military intelligence officers to engage in future missions. “There is no other way. Parliament must understand this. Please stop making this political,” he requested the MPs. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

Secretary of ACEPA, Ratnasiri Alahakoon said on Thursday (21) that eggs which looked artificial were allegedly available in the market. However, according to information these were eggs imported from India prepared to be in storage for approximately three months using chemicals. The white of the egg was said to be harder than that of a normal egg, he added. Not even the locally produced egg could be kept for that long – even in cold storage. Maximum shelf life is two to three weeks, he stressed. Alahakoon urged Authorities to carry out an urgent probe to establish how such a thing could happen.  The public can trust the local egg producers, but there are issues with the imported eggs. Such chemical treatment could be harmful, he observed. However, the point is that with no development projects in the country, it is apparent that politicians were aiming at taking commissions by importing all unnecessary commodities and thereby compromising the local industries, Alahakoon accused.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/16/government-analyst-reports-lost-in-post/,Government Analyst Reports Lost in Post,Author not found,0,2023-09-15T20:36:00+00:00," In a surprising turn of events, many reports of the Government Analyst’s Department that were sent to the relevant Courts by registered post have disappeared, and there should be a formal investigation regarding the loss of those records, the Sectoral Oversight Committee on a Just and Law-Abiding Society has recommended. This observation is included in the committee’s report on ‘Delaying the Issuing of Government Analyst’s Department Reports,’ which was presented to Parliament on 8 September by its Chair, W.D.J. Seneviratne. “One major issue highlighted during the discussion was the loss of reports sent via registered post to relevant Courts. It was observed that these reports often faced issues of non-receipt, prompting requests for resubmission. This discrepancy raised concerns, leading the committee to recommend a formal investigation into the loss of records during transit. “The delays in resubmitting reports were found to have a direct impact on legal proceedings, causing undue hardship to parties involved and compromising the timely delivery of justice,” the report said. At a Parliamentary Session held on 25 May 2023, the Sectoral Oversight Committee on a Just and Law-Abiding Society held a comprehensive discussion with officials from the Government Analyst’s Department, shedding light on significant operational setbacks. The department, entrusted with the crucial task of providing analytical and expert advisory services in forensic and food sciences to Courts, law enforcement agencies, and various institutions, was found to be grappling with issues leading to delays in submitting vital reports to relevant authorities. Another pressing concern mentioned in the report is the present vacancy rate within the department. Out of the approved staff of 350, there are 113 vacancies, including 25 in the scientific service category. The committee strongly urged the expeditious filling of these positions. Additionally, the shortage of essential resources such as chemicals, materials, machinery, and spare parts was identified as another significant factor contributing to the delay in report submissions. The delay in providing investigation reports related to drug suspects was noted to result in prolonged detention, leading to increased government spending on maintaining these detainees and contributing to prison congestion. The committee also raised concerns about certain Police Officers intentionally submitting samples in drug cases that yield negative results, potentially impacting investigations and Court proceedings. To address these issues, the Sectoral Oversight Committee has proposed a set of recommendations as well. These include improved handling of reports by personally delivering the reports to relevant Courts and establishing a formal work arrangement, in consultation with the Inspector General of Police (IGP), to reduce the number of samples yielding negative results in drug-related cases received by the Government Analyst’s Department. The IGP should also be informed to take necessary measures in Police stations where a high number of cases with negative results are presented. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the 113 employee vacancies within the department to ensure its smooth operation and timely report submissions, the committee recommended.

President’s Counsel Faiszer Musthapha, who appeared for Sirisena, filed the motion, which was considered before a Supreme Court Bench comprising Justices Bhuwaneka Aluvihare, Murdu Fernando, S. Thurairaja, Kumuduni Wickramasinghe and A.H.M.D Nawaz. Musthapha said that Channel 4 has revealed new information about the terror attacks and that a fresh committee has been appointed on the matter. Therefore, the case should be re-examined, he said. Gamini Perera, the lawyer who appeared for the petitioners, said that since the verdict given by the Supreme Court has not been implemented properly, a Contempt of Court case will be filed. Chandaka Jayasundara, who appeared for the former Director of State Intelligence Service (SIS) SDIG Nilantha Jayawardena, said his client had paid a part of the compensation and has no capability to pay the rest. After considering the arguments presented by both parties, the Court decided to take up the motion on 2 November. The Supreme Court, on 12 June ruled that former President Maithripala Sirisena and four other top officials failed to prevent the terror attack that killed nearly 270 people and ordered them to pay compensation. The seven-judge bench ruled that Sirisena was responsible for negligence to take measures to prevent the attacks despite solid intelligence warnings two weeks prior. The Court ordered the former president to pay Rs 100 million from his personal funds to family members of victims who brought the civil case before the Court. The former IGP, two former top intelligence officials and the then Secretary to the Ministry of Defence at the time were ordered to pay a total of Rs 210 million."

According to the delayed draft of the 2023 Annual Transfer List published by the Health Ministry, the vacant positions include two Anesthetists, two Surgeons, and two Paediatricians, all of which are two-man positions. Additionally, several single-station specialties are also expected to be vacant, such as Haematology, Histopathology, Oncology, Orthopaedics, ENT, Neurology, Ophthalmology, Endocrinology, Genitourinary Surgery, Venereology, Chemical Pathology, Psychiatry, Microbiology, and Judicial Medicine. District General Hospital Ampara is one of the major hospitals in the East, alongside Trincomalee and Batticaloa hospitals. Medical sources suggest that there is a strong possibility that these vacant positions will be temporarily filled by ‘Acting Consultants’ (those who have not completed foreign training) or Senior Registrars. Senior medical sources point out that this situation is not unique to District General Hospital Ampara and is prevalent in several other State hospitals in peripheral areas. The delay in publishing the 2023 specialist Annual Transfer List, which should have been available in November of the previous year, has exceeded eight months. According to regulations, medical practitioners are expected to accept their transfers and assume their positions by January of the following year. Allegations have arisen that the Ministry intentionally delayed the specialist transfer list due to this crisis. Senior medical sources have expressed concerns that the Health Ministry may expect retiring specialist doctors to fill these positions if the Cabinet approves Minister Keheliya Rambukwella’s proposal to re-recruit retired doctors on two-year contracts. The situation has been further exacerbated by the brain drain and the enforced retirement age. In the coming months, doctors may be required to cover multiple stations to sustain the State health service, they stressed. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Ratnayake also cited import limits as a reason for the decline in income and emphasised that taxes should not be imposed to a level that the people cannot afford. He stressed that increasing government income requires attracting investment.

This particular Committee is set to be made up of an officer from Sri Lanka Police, the Attorney General’s Department and the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. The President had reportedly taken this decision during the most recent National Security Council (NSC) meeting while the task of making the necessary appointments to the Committee has been entrusted to President’s Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake and State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon. Besides that, the President has also decided to form a Parliament Select Committee (PSC) to fully investigate the details put forth by the said TV Station pertaining to the Easter Sunday terror blasts while that task has been handed over to Chief Government Whip Minister Prasanna Ranatunga. It is said any individual who would like to submit evidence connected to the Easter Sunday mayhem four years ago could do so before either the three-member Committee or the PSC. Meanwhile, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said in Parliament on Friday (8) that the Sri Lankan Parliament should determine the course of action regarding the allegations raised in the recent Channel 4 video regarding the terror attacks. Minister Rajapakshe said in Parliament, “President Ranil Wickremesinghe proposed an international investigation into the Easter Sunday attacks shortly after assuming office as the President of Sri Lanka last year. However, there has been no positive response from any party on this matter. Consequently, it falls upon Parliament to decide the nature of the investigation.” He continued, “I had forewarned about an extremist attack in Sri Lanka 29 weeks prior to the Easter Sunday attacks, but I faced severe criticism from government ministers and MPs, despite being a part of the same government. The entire nation suffered due to this negligence.”"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/09/09/tesla-wanted-sls-graphite-with-a-potential-battery-manufacturing-plant-fmr-gsmb-chair/,Tesla wanted SL’s graphite with a potential battery manufacturing plant – Fmr GSMB Chair,Author not found,0,2023-09-08T20:32:00+00:00," Two representatives from Tesla, the US-based company owned by business magnate Elon Musk, had visited Sri Lanka in December 2021 with the aim of procuring graphite and investigating in the potential establishment of a car battery manufacturing plant within the country, former Chairman of the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB), Prof. Anura Walpola, claimed. He alleged the plan eventually fell through due to his ouster from the post of GSMB Chair.  Speaking to Ceylon Today Prof. Walpola emphasised that the GSMB had the authority and capability to offer its services to Tesla with the necessary Government approval and that endeavour could have been accomplished without any significant difficulty. He said they had visited his office in December 2021 and he was in the process of coordinating discussions with graphite miners about the investment where Tesla said they want 4,000MT of graphite for lithium car batteries. “I requested one week’s time to evaluate the proposal, but before the matter could progress further, a new chairman was appointed and I had to leave.” Prof. Walpola recounted the meeting with the Tesla officials, who expressed their interest in procuring a substantial monthly supply of 4,000 MT of graphite. Sri Lanka was extracting only 300 MT of graphite per month, prompting discussions to consider a feasible supply volume of at least 2,000 MT. “Digging into historical data, Prof. Walpola said that Sri Lanka had a thriving graphite mining industry in the 1940s, with 3,338 graphite mines, which had since dwindled to just a few active mines of four now. During that era, graphite was primarily used for pencils and steelmaking, whereas Tesla sought this crucial material for advanced applications in nanotechnology batteries and renewable energy solutions,” he added. The former Chairman noted that one kilogram of graphite can produce 500 gm of graphene, a material with a significant market value of USD 5,000 per kg. Regrettably, Sri Lanka had missed numerous opportunities to capitalise on this valuable resource. Prof. Walpola was determined to explore the potential of increasing graphite production in Sri Lanka. He initiated discussions with the four licensed graphite miners, after Tesla approached, to explore options for boosting production. “The plan was to issue additional licenses and employ around 200 miners, thereby enabling the supply of 2,000 MT of graphite to meet Tesla’s requirements.” However, amidst these efforts, political tensions escalated, resulting in Prof. Walpola, having to quit. “It was time to provide a credible response to Tesla’s proposal, but I was compelled to vacate my position,” he noted. He added that Sri Lanka’s high-quality Kahatagaha graphite, for lithium battery manufacturing within the country, would have been an ideal investment plan. Prof. Walpola claimed that had this venture been approved, car batteries could have been produced at a significantly reduced cost of Rs 5,000, compared to the prevailing market price of Rs 25,000. “The potential collaboration with Tesla would have been promising for Sri Lanka’s graphite industry and we have missed it,” he stressed.

According to the information obtained through a Right to Information (RTI) request, between 1 January 2022 and 31 July this year, 822 complaints have been received with regard to not maintaining minimum fuel stocks and other incidents, but no legal action has been initiated so far. This was revealed in a letter from the Marketing Manager of the CPC to the Human Resources Division. In 2022, a total of 634 complaints were received from various provinces, including the Western, Sabaragamuwa, South, North-West, North-Central, Central, Uva, North, and Eastern, with respective counts of 280, 33, 85, 109, 28, 53, 24, 12, and 10.

In response to inquiries made by Ceylon Today, regarding these complaints and the action taken, the Marketing Manager of the CPC clarified that no legal action has been taken due to ongoing investigations. Furthermore, the manager’s letter states that the complaints have been received with regard to fuel distributors who have outsourced their operations to third parties and the filling stations did not have any category of fuel at their storages for consumer sales. Additionally, the RTI revealed that the CPC lacks an electronic data system to monitor fuel stocks at petrol stations. Therefore, the CPC officials carry out monthly checks and file reports. Also, according to instructions given to distributers, they should report the status of available stocks to the CPC on a daily basis through the mobile application provided to them. On 9 June, it was reported in the media that Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera instructed the CPC to take necessary legal action against 618 fuel station owners, who failed to order the required fuel and did not maintain the minimum fuel stock of 50 per cent, thereby violating licensing conditions during previous fuel price revisions. It was reported that preliminary investigations had been concluded.  At that time, the CPC spokesperson said, the corporation has the authority to temporarily suspend the licences of fuel stations and if found guilty after a proper investigation, the licences can be cancelled permanently.

This was discussed during a meeting of the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms held recently in Parliament chaired by Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. The Committee further questioned the basis for raising fees for Law College to such extent placing a burden on the students. Responding to this concern, the Principal of the Law College stated that, unlike other Universities, the Treasury does not allocate money for the maintenance of the Law College and it has come to a stage where the future of the Law College is at stake given the high expenses and economic crisis. The Ministerial Consultative Committee on Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms considered a proposal to accrue a membership fee from practicing lawyers without burdening the students of the Law College. In light of this, the Committee Chair was of the view the matter should be further discussed and looked into."

He said the Health Minister and the officials who concealed the information should be removed from their positions and brought to book if the use of medicinal drugs had resulted in the deaths of patients. Dr. Sanjeewa noted that according to a communiqué (bearing No: NMRA/AD/CH/PR number 09.08.2023) the Chairman of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), Prof. S.D. Jayaratne accepted that the medicines Propofol, Bupivacaine, Co-amoxiclav and Ceftriaxone procured by the Health Ministry and distributed to the hospitals had caused severe anaphylactic reactions in patients leading to their deaths. According to Prof. Jayaratne, these drugs had failed in laboratory tests, failed in biological tests, and failed in American National Standards in tests conducted after the complications or deaths of patients. With this, Sri Lanka will join the ranks of countries like South Africa and Latin America, which manufacture, distribute and use substandard drugs in the world. This seriously undermines Sri Lanka’s international reputation, Dr. Sanjeewa lamented.

The Minister stated this at the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Public Security held in Parliament recently. Furthermore, the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Public Security inquired about the rewards and recognition of Police officers conducting drug raids. The senior Police officers, who were present, stated that a mechanism is already in place for such rewards and recognition and posts considering the facts related to such raids, the respective officers are being subjected to the due rewards and recognition. The Committee also inquired about the non-utilisation of the residence allocated for the Officer-in-Charge of the Imaduwa Police Station. The officials who were present stated that arrangements have been made to put the residence to use. The Committee inquired about the arrangements regarding use of drugs, distribution and drug control at ground level. Senior Police officers stated that unlike before, when the Police received information regarding the possession of drugs, where the person in possession is charged for illegal possession and produced in Court, the Police now conduct two separate inquiries on illegal possession as well as money laundering. The Committee also raised concerns regarding the ethicality of Traffic Police videorecording traffic offences and then releasing it to the Media. The Committee was of the view that the Police must respect the privacy of any offender. IGP C.D. Wickramaratne, while acknowledging that there is a concern in this regard, stated that he will look into the matter and work towards resolving it.

A Right to Information (RTI) request revealed that the Ministry has no records with regard to the foreign trips from 2012 to 2018. “This gap is primarily due to inadequate documentation during the handover and transition periods when ministries change. These transitions have not been conducted in a proper and organised manner,” S.N.B.K.S. Senaratne, Additional Secretary (Administration) of the ministry said. Accordingly, although the ministry is responsible for securely maintaining its information, some data has been lost during the merging of the ministry with various others.  The Additional Secretary, who is also the Information Officer of the ministry, further disclosed that most of the information initially held by the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation is now in the possession of other ministries. Additionally, a significant portion of the expenses incurred post-merger with another ministry, is recorded in the financial records of those other ministries. Efforts made to contact the Ministry Secretary and the Chief Financial Officer, to seek clarification on this issue, proved futile.

Senior Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris told the Court, that the witness concerned had disappeared from a few places that he had resided previously. He therefore requested the Court, to instruct the Director of the CID, to deploy a few teams under his supervision, to arrest the witness. Taking the submissions into consideration, Judge Thotawatta deferred further hearing of testimony for the prosecution till 5 December and advised the fifth witness for the prosecution, to appear before him, at the next hearing.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/26/dutch-govt-to-open-up-museum-vaults-to-sl-researchers/,Dutch Govt to open up museum vaults to SL researchers,Author not found,0,2023-08-25T20:36:00+00:00," There may be around 3,000 items of interest for researchers in museum vaults in the Netherlands, which were collected during the colonial period and as a part of the recent policy of the Dutch Government, to return the stolen artefacts to their rightful owners, the researchers from the former colonies will be granted access to those collections, Ambassador of The Netherlands in Sri Lanka, Bonnie Horbach said. During a briefing with a group of newspaper editors and electronic media heads on Friday (25), the Ambassador explained that there had not been a study done to ascertain whether the items were of any value and that it is up to respective States and their researchers to determine whether they wanted the items to be returned or not.  “Among those collections there may be items that were either stolen, or commissioned and paid for by Dutch money. It is important to identify the items that were stolen. Therefore, we decided to open up the museum vaults, where researchers will have access to those items and decide whether they want certain items returned or not,” she added. The briefing was organised in the backdrop where a delegation from the Netherlands, led by Gunay Uslu, the State Secretary for Culture and Media, is set to visit Sri Lanka from 27 to 31 August to finalise the legal arrangements for the transfer of ownership of cultural artefacts that will be returned to Sri Lanka later this year. Transfer of ownership The official signing ceremony, to transfer ownership of six artefacts, will take place on Monday (28 August) at 3.15 p.m. at the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs ofSri Lanka. “On this occasion, two agreements will be signed. One is to legally transfer the ownership of the artefacts. The second one is to loan them to the Netherlands for a further period until the items are physically transferred to Sri Lanka in early December,” Ambassador Horbach said. She also said this is only the beginning of a long process which will continue for a period of at least 5 to 10 years, during which she hoped the two countries would be able to develop stronger cooperation between researchers, particularly when it comes to preserving historical manuscripts.   “So far we have kept these manuscripts in dry conditions. But they have become brittle with age. These manuscripts are written in palm and ola leaves, using a unique technology. We have no expertise on this. Sri Lankan experts have the knowledge and technology to better preserve them. “Also, the manuscripts are in Sinhala and Tamil and written about 350 years ago. We don’t have the knowledge to read them. Therefore, we want to give access to Sri Lankan researchers to study them,” the Ambassador added. When asked whether there was any resistance to the process of returning the stolen artefacts, she said, museums in general are open about the process. “They are not reluctant, but rather keen. But, that does not mean there is no resistance. What we need to understand is although there is no legal obligation to return these artefacts there is a human and ethical obligation to do so.” She also said, there are certain items that were initially stolen by other European nations but have somehow ended up at the museums in the Netherlands, and they are looking to return such items as well. “The fact that they were looted by others, does not release us from the obligation to return them.” ‘What is stolen is stolen’ When the Dutch Government announced the return of stolen artefacts to Sri Lanka, many embraced the decision, while some were sceptical. Some sections of the public claimed that the artefacts should be left in the Dutch museums for safety and for better preservation, and that the return should be subjected to strict conditions by the Dutch. Ambassador Horbach, however, has a different view. “What is stolen is stolen. We cannot return them to the rightful owners and then impose conditions. That’s not the way to do it. On the other hand, museum theft happens everywhere in the world. This happens at the museums in the Netherlands. We all saw what happened at the British museum.” She also said although the national museum in Sri Lanka may not have some of the technology used by the Dutch museums, its conditions are up to international standards. “Sri Lanka has a number of highly-educated and enthusiastic experts who are passionate about their work. Therefore, it will not be a difficult task to preserve the returned artefacts. In fact, we are ready to provide them any assistance if it is required.” When asked whether the Netherlands taking the lead in returning stolen artefacts — particularly after the apologies issued by their Prime Minister in 2022 and just a few weeks ago by the Dutch King for the atrocities committed in the name of colonisation – the other European nations would follow the example, the Ambassador said, it is up to the individual States to decide as there is no legal obligation to do so. For certain nations however, the process is much more complicated. While several British Prime Ministers famously refused to return looted treasures, the British Museum Act of 1963 was created to make it illegal to give looted treasures back to the people they were looted from.    The process which will begin with the return of artefact and opening doors for Sri Lankan researchers to study stolen manuscripts, will have to next focus on the stolen fauna and flora. Although it is not part of the ongoing policy and discussion, the Ambassador believes that it is important to make this also part of the current dialogue. She added that the collection of fauna and flora is highly valuable and the study of this can shed light on the life as it was several centuries ago. Global South / North Balance Ambassador Horbach elaborated that returning the artefact is not closing a chapter but in fact the beginning of a new chapter in establishing balance between Global South and Global North, especially when talking about economic reparations for the atrocities committed by the colonial empires, particularly in the Global South. She pointed out that the resources that were plundered during colonial times cannot quantify in a real sense. For example, the Kandyan Kings had trade deals with the Dutch. Although the Dutch were quite meticulous at keeping records, it would be a near impossible task to quantify the actual amounts at today’s value. Ambassador Horbach opined that the unequal relationship between the Global South and Global North that existed during colonial times continues to exist today. “We need to critically look at certain standards that we set for countries in the Global South, such as labour and climate conditions, and many countries find it difficult to meet them. This perpetuates the unequal relationship.” She also pointed out that there is a tendency in the Global West to consider the material imported from the Global South as just raw material and it is the West that adds the branding value to such products. For example, diamonds, tea and textile are imported from the Global South and marketed by adding the brand value, which creates a massive discrepancy. “What we need is an open discussion on making this multilateral system more inclusive,” Ambassador Horbach stressed.    The Dutch have taken the first step forward in acknowledging and making amends for the centuries of oppression and exploitation done in the name of colonisation. Here is hoping that other European nations will also be conscientious enough to follow their example. By Vindya Amaranayake"

Rajakumari, a housemaid, who died while in the custody of the Welikada Police. Magistrate Kekunawala delivered the verdict after careful examination of evidence and the findings in the post-mortem report submitted by the Judicial Medical Officer. The cause of death was ruled as hemorrhagic shock caused by damage to the muscles after being attacked with a blunt weapon or similar force. The Magistrate fixed the case to be taken up again on 27 October and ordered the CID to submit a report on the progress of investigations on that day. Rajakumari, 41, a resident of Badulla, was arrested on 11 May on a complaint made by her employer, claiming that she had stolen gold jewellery. She had later died, while in the custody of the Welikada Police and her relatives claimed that she had been subjected to assault. When the case was taken up on Friday, the hearing of evidence, led by the Criminal Investigation Department’s Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Meryl Ranjan Lamahewa, was concluded. During a previous Court hearing, a witness, identified as Mahendran Suresh, had testified that he had seen Rajakumari being assaulted by the officers of Welikada Police. He also claimed that he was handcuffed by two Police Officers at the Pettah Bus Stand and taken to a house at Cotta Road in Borella, where Rajakumari was employed. According to Suresh, both he and Rajakumari were handcuffed together, and at that point, she had been in good health. After taking them to the Welikada Police Station, Suresh said, two officers had assaulted both him and Rajakumari, despite her employer’s pleas to resolve the issue in a non-violent manner. Later, disciplinary action was taken against seven officers of the Welikada Police, with a Sub-Inspector, two Sergeants and a Constable being interdicted, while a Constable and two Women Constables were transferred.

The most-recent incident involved the destruction of 50 acres of land due to a fire in the deciduous forest belonging to the Rakwana South Grama Niladhari Division. This forest is situated on the border of the Sinharaja Forest Reserve, close to the Galdola Ella in Rakwana. This area, which is home to numerous springs that have dried up due to the prevailing weather conditions, constitutes a biodiversity hotspot with Kekilla plants, orchids, and pitcher plants, along with various endemic bird species. Unfortunately, the flames have consumed the vegetation in this region. Additionally, the Rakwana River which is the primary source of water in Godakawela originates from the fire-affected area. On 15 August morning, a fire ignited in the reserve situated above Nelawatta Estate in Rakwana. Although the fire was initially extinguished, it flared up once again on 22 August night, despite the village committees’ efforts to warn the Nelawatta Estate residents about the risk of reigniting. The fire persisted until 23 August evening. While officials from the Rakwana Forest Office and the Divisional Secretariat attempted to contain the fire, it continued to spread rapidly due to the prevailing strong winds. With coordination from the Godakawela Divisional Secretary and assistance from Kuruwita Army camp personnel, the fire was finally brought under control by 23 afternoon. Unfortunately, the fire reignited in the same area that night. Environmentalists had conducted afforestation efforts in the affected region, which has now been obliterated by the fire. A local myth suggests that rain will follow when this part of the mountain experiences a fire, though area residents also suspect that the fires might have been deliberately set, possibly related to illicit liquor production or an attempt to seize land for cultivation. In response to these ongoing fires, a meeting was convened on Thursday (24) at Ubhayatilakarama temple in Rakwana, led by the Godakawela Divisional Secretary, and attended by residents and State officials. The Rakwana OIC said strict legal action would be taken against those responsible for the arson attack on the reserve. By Suranga Thilakarathne – Rakwana"

They stated that they are against the preliminary work currently underway by a private company in the Kosgulana. This group has constructed a mini hydro power plant by building a dam in the area that belongs to the Pitakanda Grama Niladhari Division, located below the Kukule Ganga in the Ayagama.

This remark was made by Kumarasinghe during a press conference at the President’s Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (25). She also expressed her opinion that NCPA officials should continue their services instead of focusing on the staff shortage issue. Kumarasinghe mentioned that she plans to bring this matter to the attention of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, as he serves as the Cabinet Minister for her portfolio. However, the NCPA has repeatedly expressed concerns to the authorities about the staff shortage. Although the ideal staffing for the NCPA should be 618 employees, including Zonal Officers, they are currently operating with only 288 staff members, which is less than half of what is needed. The repercussions of such understaffing in critical sectors can be extensive and harmful. Delays in addressing complaints, conducting investigations, and providing essential services can result in a breakdown of justice administration and rights protection. This situation also places a heavy burden on the existing staff, affecting their ability to fulfil their responsibilities effectively. Additionally, Kumarasinghe touched upon the topic of gender equality, noting that although she doesn’t frequently discuss it, she strongly believes that gender inequality is prevalent in the labour sector, particularly concerning wage payment to female and male employees. She stressed that achieving equal wages for both genders in the labour sector is imperative. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

He urged Sri Lanka to critically evaluate its foreign policy in this evolving context and make necessary adjustments. Gammanpila pointed out that the dominance of the USD as the international currency is bolstered by the G7 nations, which includes the United States. In contrast, BRICS is actively exploring alternative approaches for international transactions that are less dependent on the US dollar. Meanwhile, the BRICS group of nations has decided to invite six countries – Argentina, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to become new members of the bloc, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday (24).

Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha made this remark, when concerns were raised with regard to taking action against Ali Sabri Raheem, a member of the All Ceylon Makkal Congress. Raheem stands accused of smuggling gold and smartphones. Raheem was arrested when he attempted to smuggle 3.3 kg of gold and 74 smartphones through the VIP lounge at the BIA in May of this year. Premajayantha in response made a motion to summon MP Raheem before the Committee on Privileges. The intention behind this action is to address Raheem’s conduct of smuggling items using his diplomatic passport, which is considered an insult to the legislative body. Chief Opposition Whip, Lakshman Kiriella then proposed the establishment of provisions that would allow for the expulsion of any MP who commits offenses that bring disrepute to the Legislature. He pointed out that such provisions existed during the time of Lord Soulbury, during which four MPs who were involved in bribery were expelled from the House. Premajayantha told Kiriella, “We are ready to collaborate with you.

It has come to light that though Sri Lanka had received USD 250 million worth of fuel from Iran, the Government has to date reneged on its promise to that country to send tea valued at the same price. It has been alleged that the failure of the CPC to deposit the requisite finances to Sri Lanka Tea had created this unwarranted situation. These details had surfaced following a recent discussion held by the President along with his Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake with a group of local tea exporters in Colombo. However, following instructions from the President it had been decided to send across monthly tea stocks to Tehran worth USD 5 million. The officials had also consented to depositing the requisite funds to the Tea Board following talks with the officials from the CPC. As part of this process, the first such consignment of tea had been sent to Iran during the past week, while the officials from the Tea Exporters Association (TEA) had informed the officials at the Presidential Secretariat that the price of a kilo of raw tea leaves, which had decreased in the recent past, had increased to Rs 200 per kilo.

This meeting was convened at the Presidential Secretariat, where President Wickremesinghe engaged with Governors and Provincial Chief Secretaries. The purpose of this gathering was to discuss upcoming administrative protocols related to the provincial council system, according to the PMD. According to the President’s Media Division (PMD), drawing attention to incomplete two-storey buildings constructed under the ‘the best school is the nearest school’ concept, the Governors emphasised instances of building deterioration. They appealed for the creation of a suitable programme to address this concern. During the meeting, President Ranil Wickremesinghe unveiled a novel strategy aimed at enhancing the efficiency of operations within Local Councils, Provincial Councils, and Central Government bodies, all with the objective of minimising financial inefficiencies. The President instructed officials to formulate this innovative approach with a strong focus on optimising the performance of these three entities. Additionally, President Wickremesinghe directed officials to collaborate closely with Governors and Chief Secretaries to compile a comprehensive report on this initiative within a month. These consultations are designed to ensure a well-rounded perspective is incorporated before finalising the new strategy. Saman Ekanayake, the Secretary to the President, expressed optimism regarding the support from the Presidential Secretariat in addressing the challenges faced by Provincial Councils in their interactions with the Central Government, the report added. During the discussion, the attending Governors highlighted the urgent need to promptly fill teacher vacancies within their respective jurisdictions. They observed an imbalance, with certain schools having a surplus of teachers while others faced shortages. In response, they proposed the implementation of a teacher exchange programme to rectify this disparity. The Governors also raised the issue of stalled development projects that had been allocated funds. Unfortunately, progress on some of these projects had been hindered due to pending funds, they pointed out. In addition to these topics, the Governors requested the President’s support in promoting opportunities for advancing the provincial-level tourism industry."

However, this endorsement from the PUCSL is contingent upon certain conditions. The PUCSL, in a statement said, the additional power supply will be operated based on a merit order system and the transmission licence holders are required to exhibit that the power plants are managed through an independent dispatch audit at the conclusion of the Power Purchase Agreement period. Furthermore, the procurement of this supplementary power will be executed with a focus on obtaining it at the lowest possible cost. The rationale behind this decision is rooted in the fact that the Cabinet of Ministers had declared a state of emergency concerning the release of water from the Samanalawewa Power Plant for downstream cultivation irrigation purposes. To avoid planned power cuts, a directive was issued during the Cabinet meeting held on 7 August 2023, necessitating the procurement of an additional 100MW of power by 15 August 2023, for a duration of four to six months. Taking into consideration the information, provided by the Meteorology Department, which indicates that substantial rainfall is anticipated only around mid-October 2023, this decision was taken. Additionally, the activation of the new Polpitiya 220kV transmission line has enabled the Mahaweli Complex to establish a connection between the 220kV network and the southern sector of the power grid. According to the statement, the inclusion of supplementary power is anticipated to contribute to a reduction in hydro dispatch throughout the year, while also facilitating the accumulation of adequate hydro storage as an initial reservoir in the Year 2024."

Speaking at an event, the Minister indicated that a detailed report concerning the extent of damage to paddy crops is anticipated to be made available in the upcoming weeks. Furthermore, Minister Amaraweera projected that the adverse impact on paddy cultivation could surpass 50,000 acres by the time the comprehensive report is officially published. Meanwhile, Amaraweera has also announced that swift measures will be taken to address the challenges arising from the procurement of paddy from farmers. The Minister highlighted that due to insufficient funds allocated by the Paddy Marketing Board for paddy purchases, a portion of paddy has been procured using funds from the Treasury. This financial constraint has resulted in farmers being disinclined to sell their paddy as the expected prices are not being met. During a recent Ministerial Consultative Committee on Agriculture meeting held in Parliament, the Minister responded to concerns raised by Parliamentarians regarding paddy procurement. He pointed out that even if rice is bought at the minimum price designated for paddy procurement, the Paddy Marketing Board would have to sell rice at a rate lower than that price. Given this predicament, he indicated that resolutions will be sought through discussions with relevant stakeholders to address the issues pertaining to paddy procurement. MPs from Batticaloa and Ampara Districts brought to his attention that farmers in their regions had to acquire fertilisers at higher costs due to commencing the season earlier than other areas. In response, the Minister stated that he intends to collectively decide the commencement date of the season during meetings, aiming for a general approach. Additionally, he emphasised the intention to publicly announce the start date to have a uniform impact across the entire island."

The Central Environment Authority stated that the owners of this factory will be subjected to legal consequences under the provisions of the National Environmental Act. Ajith Weerasundara, Deputy Director General of the CEA, emphasised that the factory’s failure to secure the environment licence has resulted in environmental damage due to the release of chemical substances during the fire. While investigations to determine the cause of the fire are on-going, Weerasundara pointed out that the exact reason behind the fire has not yet been determined. The fire had spread to a garment factory situated within the industrial zone and an adjacent factory had also suffered from the blaze. As per reports, the factory affected by the fire was involved in the production of sanitizers and chemicals meant for water purification. Several firefighting units collaborated in attempts to contain the fire, although achieving control proved to be challenging. Eventually, after continuous efforts throughout the night, the fire was successfully extinguished. However, its smoke dispersed across a considerable area. Substances like chlorine and sodium silicate ignited within the chemical factory, resulting in the dissemination of a chlorine odour throughout the vicinity. Regions such as Mawathagama Uduwana, situated a distance from Katuwana, displayed a haze reminiscent of white smoke on Friday morning. Additionally, Dr. Indika Katudampa, the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) for Homagama, said that an odour originating from the chlorine gas, released during the fire, was perceptible. He cautioned that given the presence of chlorine at a low level in the atmosphere, inhalation of the gas was probable. Individuals inhaling the smoke faced an elevated risk of developing respiratory complications, particularly those who already contend with respiratory issues, who should exercise extra caution.

Dolawatte, emphasised his intention to introduce a bill to establish a mandatory 25 per cent representation of youth within Local Government bodies. This proposal underscores the commitment to fostering generational inclusivity and engaging the perspectives of young citizens in governance processes, he said. The MP highlighted that the objective of this initiative is to reinstate an opportunity that has historically existed in this nation but was regrettably lost over time. He expressed confidence in garnering the backing of both parliamentary colleagues and the general public to realise this endeavour. Dolawatte made these remarks during a media briefing at the President’s Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (18). In addition, he emphasised that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s agenda is centred around affording opportunities to the youth and facilitating their active involvement in the decision-making framework. Dolawatte further elaborated on this perspective. The discourse surrounding youth representation remains consistent, acknowledging the historical backdrop of youth-led uprisings in Sri Lanka, such as the events of 1971 and 1989. “Notably, it was subsequent to the 1989 unrest that a paradigm shift occurred, affording the youth the prospect of engaging in politics and facilitating essential interventions to enable their participation. The Youth Discontent Commission had initially extended a significant opportunity by proposing a provision for 25 per cent youth nominations within local government bodies. However, an unfortunate turn of events occurred when the introduction of women’s representation rights in the previous season led to the inadvertent dismissal of the youth’s entitlement, as stipulated by the relevant Local Government Act,” he said."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/12/srilankan-seeks-potential-gulf-buyers/,SriLankan seeks potential Gulf buyers,Author not found,0,2023-08-11T20:36:00+00:00,"SriLankan Airlines should be a target for takeover by carriers in the Gulf once it is privatised, after making an operating profit for the first time in 15 years, its Chief Executive said. Richard Nuttall also suggested that Gulf operators could substantially benefit from the airline’s easy access to its Asian neighbour. “The big prize for everybody is India,” he said. He suggested that Emirates, which previously owned 40 per cent of SriLankan, might be among those carriers who respond to the Colombo Government’s wish to privatise the airline. It was part-owned by Emirates for 10 years until the Sri Lankan Government bought all the airline’s shares in 2008. In that year SriLankan made a profit of nearly USD 30 million but under government administration, over the next seven years, it lost USD 875 million. Asked if the Dubai-based airline was among likely bidders Nuttall said he could not “speak for either Emirates or anybody else in the Gulf” but the Government’s plan was “to look for expressions of interest in the coming months and they want to do that fast”. SriLankan has been severely impacted by a triple hit: the collapse in tourism during the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2019 ISIS-coordinated Easter suicide bombings and last year’s financial ructions. Despite the turmoil, Nuttall, who has worked for eight airlines, has taken the company into an operating profit that could have been significant if not for the large debts he inherited. “Essentially, on a USD 1 billion turnover the business made USD 100 million profit,” he said. “But we then had to pay almost all our profit on finance charges. But the essential thing that we’ve got here is an airline that works and over time should definitely make money.” The profit means that for the first time since it was managed by Emirates in 2008, it has not been in the red. Income could be further enhanced with an ambition to double the fleet from 23 aircraft to 40 in the next three to five years. Significant rewards then await with the India market a vastly untapped resource, argued the 57-year-old Chief Executive from Yorkshire, England. “The big prize for everybody is India,” he said speaking at his office in Colombo. “If you work with us then you start being relevant to the Indian market in all directions. So, I think that’s the big interest for the Gulf carriers.” Despite being the world’s most populous nation of 1.4 billion, India has just 0.5 commercial aircraft per million people whereas China has three and America 30. With the wait for new commercial aircraft stretching to five years, having a partnership with a major airline would bring significant benefits to help exploit the vast India market. “We are right next door to the most populous country in the world,” Nuttall said. “If we get an airline investment then that can help us with buying power or assistance with expertise in certain areas.” While Gulf buyers are a possibility, Indian media have also reported that the major industrial conglomerate Tata Enterprises is a potential investor after its recent purchase of Indian Airlines. Nuttall, who has previously worked for Saudi Airlines and Royal Jordanian, suggested the alliance could be a useful fit given Sri Lanka’s proximity to India and its understanding of its culture. The airline also serves 14 Indian cities. He said Sri Lanka, with its vast unspoilt shoreline, was “the closest international friendly beach to India by a long way”. The airline would also offer a Gulf carrier a significant hub in Southern Asia for onward flights to China, Australia and South-East Asia. Nuttall pointed out that customers in India who wish to fly east currently have to “backhaul” three or four hours to the major hubs of Mumbai or Delhi on the West Coast before heading eastward again. “Essentially we give you a hub in the South-East so you become more relevant in more directions for more cities.” Last year Sri Lanka’s newly appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pledged to privatise the airline as it was still making a loss. “Even if we privatise SriLankan Airlines, this is a loss that we must bear, even by the poor people of this country who have never stepped on an aeroplane,” he said. However, in a meeting this year SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ashok Pathirage said, in the past three years “we have not received any money from the Treasury, we did not take even one dollar”. It is understood that the Government will decide on privatisation steps in the coming year. The main revenue sources for SriLankan are the country’s significant Diaspora in the UK, Australia and the Middle East, as well as the Indian market. It also has the major attraction that the airline’s host country is as a tourist destination unspoilt by major development and with a very welcoming population. “I’ve never had anywhere where so many people have said, ‘Wow, the best holiday I ever had was in Sri Lanka,’” said Nuttall, who is married with two teenage children. “The people here are interested, they smile, making it so much more personable with much more human interaction than elsewhere.” The new Sri Lankan Government wants him to regrow the airline to pre-Covid levels “and then see what a potential buyer might want beyond that”. While it flies to 126 destinations in 61 countries, including direct routes to Melbourne, London and Dubai, Nuttall is looking to have three daily flights to top Gulf and European destinations. Part of the expansion plans are also to build a new terminal in Colombo, allowing the airport to double passenger numbers. “If we have more frequency, then we’re a stronger product and we can stimulate more tourism,” Nuttall said. This he hopes could get the country back to its 2018 numbers of three million visitors a year.  (The National)"

A five-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court, led by Justice Murdu Fernando, ruled that the application was legally flawed, lacked foundation and served to cause disruption. Consequently, the Court opted to reject the application right away. The basis of this contempt case pertained to alleged disrespectful conduct exhibited by Chief Justice Jayasuriya on 21 September 2017, while he was serving as the Attorney General. This conduct was said to undermine the Supreme Court’s authority and reputation, specifically in regard to the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill, which was presented to the Speaker of Parliament. Attorney General, Sanjay Rajaratnam, who participated in the case, as an impartial legal adviser (Amicus Curiae), moved for the application’s dismissal on grounds of legal misconceptions. He argued that the application, along with the affidavit provided by the petitioner Nagananda Kodithuwakku, contained offensive and defamatory statements, flawed facts, misleading information, untrue allegations and distorted legal arguments. According to the Attorney General, the application did not adhere to legal standards. Moreover, the Attorney General emphasised that the opinion presented on the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill by the then Attorney General, as per his constitutional duties, outlined in Article 77(2) of the Constitution, had been tendered to fulfil his obligations under the law. The opinion was provided in September 2017. The Supreme Court concluded that the vexatious nature of this application undermined the dignity and authority of the country’s highest and ultimate Superior Court, the Supreme Court itself."

Jayaratne disclosed this information while responding to a query raised by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Ashok Abeysinghe, who inquired whether there were plans to relocate the Welikada Prison to a different location. The State Minister further stated that a portion of the funds garnered from this assessment will be allocated to construct a prison in the Horana area. The remaining funds will be channelled to the Treasury, in line with a decision that has been made to that effect. Elaborating on the matter, Jayaratne underscored that the Welikada Prison’s land, spanning approximately 40 acres, holds significant commercial value within the Western Province. He also noted that preparations are underway to secure two hundred acres of land for the establishment of the Horana Prison. Importantly, he emphasised that all planning and execution will occur without utilising any funds from the Treasury. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

Siyambalapitiya made this statement, while delivering a special address to Parliament regarding the Parate execution law. Highlighting the application of the Parate law, the Minister noted that from January to June of the present year, 19 banks and financial entities had invoked the Parate law on 173 occasions, leading to the retrieval of loans amounting to Rs 15 billion.

The President has advised officials to probe circumstances which led to the decision and the reasons. The President has taken this measure following submissions made to him by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) officers, who had observed that one of the main reasons for the Samanalawewa water issue had been the release of waters at an inopportune time.  Informed sources had revealed to the President that the situation had come to a head due to the release of water from the Samanalawewa, when there had not been any issue with the Udawalawe Reservoir. It is said that officials from the agriculture sector had informed the farmers to set aside waters from the Udawalawe for 13,000 acres of paddy cultivation and a further 12,000 acres for the cultivation of other crops from a total acreage of 25,000 which is supported by its waters.

Opposition MPs expressed concern over the Speaker’s ruling, which was issued on 9 August. This ruling stated that the Judiciary lacks the authority to issue orders or judgments against resolutions passed by the legislature. The MPs argue that this ruling could set a negative precedent, potentially leading to conflicts between Parliament and the judiciary, eventually culminating in a Constitutional crisis. In response to these concerns, the Speaker stated, “I sought legal advice and thoroughly considered all relevant matters before reaching my ruling. Additionally, my ruling did not reference any specific Court case. Therefore, I will not retract it.” Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who initiated the request to the Speaker, highlighted that this ruling could establish a perilous precedent. He cautioned that this ruling might hinder the judiciary from delivering judgments in the future. Dissanayake also suggested that the Speaker might be excessively inclined to appease the Executive branch. He implored the Speaker to reconsider his ruling, emphasising that doing so would help preserve his dignity. MP Prof. G.L Periris argued that the Speaker’s ruling might lead to a Constitutional crisis and ultimately undermine the rule of law. Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella criticised the Speaker for influencing the judiciary by issuing the ruling ahead of the Courts’ judgment on the domestic debt restructuring issue. Kiriella pointed out that the Speaker’s reference to a previous ruling by the late Speaker Anura Bandaranaike appeared untimely, given that Bandaranaike had delivered his ruling before the Court verdict in the case involving former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva’s impeachment. Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha countered the Opposition MPs’ concerns by asserting that the judiciary’s role is to assess the consistency of a given legislature with the Constitution. He clarified that the current Speaker merely referenced a resolution passed by the legislature and reaffirmed the supremacy of Parliament, without challenging the judiciary. Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva intervened in the discussion, asserting that the Speaker’s rulings cannot be contested. He emphasised that a Speaker’s ruling can only be addressed through a no-confidence motion against the Speaker himself. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

Accordingly, the Atigala family, proprietors of the relevant tea estate, have granted their consent to the arrangement, foregoing any compensation claims from either CEB or the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL). As a result, CEB is now poised to complete the necessary work on the electricity transmission route from Polpitiya, Laxapana to Hambantota within six days. The conflict originated when the landowners initially requested compensation amounting to Rs 48 million based on a private estimate, and subsequently Rs 9.6 million following criteria set by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In contrast, CEB had offered Rs 1.6 million in compensation for the loss of land to facilitate the installation of a 630-metre power cable, which would establish a connection between the Southern Province and CEB’s main transmission line. During a meeting of the Conciliation Board held on Friday (11) with the mediation of the PUCSL, the family approved the move. By Chamara Amarasooriya"

The bottom line is that it’s about Sri Lankans’ economic interest to address some of these challenges,” he added. He highlighted the pervasive and damaging nature of corruption, emphasising how it hampers progress on both national and personal levels and impedes people’s ability to achieve their aspirations. On meeting the acting Justice Minister, Nephew, said they discussed the challenges Sri Lanka is facing and the ways they can work together to address them. The important thing is we try to work with partners in various ways to address it. He said, they can use other resources and spoke on how other countries addressed corruption. He also spoke on the technical support towards achieving it especially in complex financial transactions. He said, there are multilateral institutions including the UN Convention against Corruption Conference of the States Parties which is going to be held in Atlanta, Georgia at the end of this year and the US is trying to focus on getting more opportunities for people to engage in such work. On the Anti-Corruption Bill that was passed in Parliament in April this year, he said, the final text of the Bill is not yet available and many amendments are being put in there. “I don’t know whether anyone who has seen it knows whether the final text is ready. I think there is certainly a lot to be positive in the draft. I think there are lots of changes that were proposed and suggestions as well. So, the final text is yet to be looked at.” He underscored that addressing corruption is a fundamental component of America’s foreign policy, particularly concerning the well-being of the American middle class. Collaborative efforts with international partners are pivotal in combating this issue. Nephew said, corruption knows no boundaries, transcending borders without constraint. Corrupt actors, whether operating domestically or utilising the US financial system, often spread their assets across the globe. Thus, a collective approach is essential to counteract these activities. He acknowledged that journalists and civil societies play a pivotal role in unveiling corruption and establishing connections that are critical to understanding and addressing the issue. He highlighted the essential contributions of these entities within the broader framework of combating corruption, noting that their work often involves personal risks and dangers, extending to their families. Nephew affirmed that the United States is actively seeking ways to support journalism and journalists engaged in this important work. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi for his now-expunged Bharat Mata remarks, PM Modi said it was the Indira Gandhi Government which gave away Kachchatheevu to Sri Lanka in 1974. “Kachchatheevu is an island between Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. Somebody gave it to another country. It happened under the leadership of Indira Gandhi,” he said. “Wasn’t that part of Maa Bharati there?” he quipped. Today a part of Sri Lanka, Kachchatheevu remains a hot-button political issue in Tamil Nadu, for politicians across the aisle. Just recently, ahead of Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s visit to New Delhi, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin wrote to PM Modi requesting him to retrieve the island. “The transfer of Kachchatheevu to Sri Lanka, by the Union government, without the state government’s consent, has deprived Tamil Nadu fishermen’s rights and adversely impacted their livelihoods,” Stalin’s letter said. Kachchatheevu is a 285-acre uninhabited speck in the Palk Strait, between India and Sri Lanka. It is no more than 1.6 km in length and slightly over 300 m wide at its broadest point. It lies northeast of Rameswaram, about 33 km from the Indian coast. It is about 62 km southwest of Jaffna, at the northern tip of Sri Lanka, and 24 km away from the inhabited Delft Island, belonging to Sri Lanka. In 1974, Indira Gandhi made attempts to settle the maritime border between India and Sri Lanka, once and for all. As a part of this settlement, known as the ‘Indo-Sri Lankan Maritime agreement’, Indira Gandhi ‘ceded’ Kachchatheevu to Sri Lanka. At the time, she thought the island had little strategic value and that ceasing India’s claim over the island would deepen its ties with its Southern neighbour.(Indian Express)"

However, sources said on Friday (4) that the NMRA was yet to register the dengue vaccine due to lack of research data and research material. Also the Expert Committee of the Epidemiology Unit too, should give the green light. As it is, the vaccine is suited for Type II dengue while currently Sri Lanka is affected by Type III, they noted. Sri Lanka had been severely affected by Type II dengue, in 2017. They noted that prior to giving its approval the NMRA and the Expert Committee should ensure the safety, efficacy and the durability of the vaccine. Unlike the Covid -19 vaccine, the public cannot be expected to take booster dose after booster dose. Therefore, the said vaccine should be able to prevent people from contracting the viral infection as well as it should be able to protect those who contract it. Dengue has been affecting Sri Lanka annually, therefore knowing that, neither the NMRA nor the Health Ministry should merely get down a vaccine which would not be able to control the infection. There are concerns as to what the impact of a vaccine meant for the Type II dengue would have on patients infected with Type III of the mosquito-borne infection.

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), in response to a Right to Information (RTI) request of former JVP Provincial Councillor Nalin Hewage, revealed that an outstanding electricity bill of Rs 2,682,246.57 was due for the Weeraketiya house, relating to the provision of security lights and generators for an event that took place between 12 – 15 September 2019. The CEB said, they had installed security lights and generators for the mentioned function at the Weeraketiya house on being informed that former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was to attend a function on the said dates. The CEB further said, despite providing the services and incurring the electricity charges of Rs 2,682,246.57, the payment has not been settled after four years, even after multiple requests from it to do so. When Hewage publicly accused Namal Rajapaksa of dodging payment of the said electricity bill on a television show, (Namal) Rajapaksa denied receiving any such bill. “That is when I decided to file an RTI request and obtain the information,” Hewage told Ceylon Today. After the CEB’s response to Hewage’s RTI request went viral on social media on Friday (4), Namal Rajapaksa took action and sent a letter to the CEB.

This decision was reached at a discussion chaired by President’s Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake. It has been proposed to lay a cable that could carry 220 MW from Bopitiya to Hambantota to connect the Southern Province to the main transmission line of the CEB. Although this project was initiated with a loan facility provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), it could not be completed as 600-metre overhead transmission cables would pass over a privately owned tea estate and it required the approval of the owner. This problem has arisen because the owner of the estate demanded a huge sum as compensation to let the power lines pass over the land and kept changing the sum from time to time. According to the Government’s assessment, compensation of Rs 1.6 million was recommended to be paid for the laying of electric cables over the private land, but the tea estate owner has now demanded Rs 9.6 million, thus delaying work. Electricity is supplied to five districts of the Southern Province with hydropower generated from the Samanalawewa Hydropower Station. CEB officials have informed the Government that if the Samanalawewa dries up, the Southern Province will experience hour-long power cuts. Even if Embilipitiya private mini power plant supplies electricity, it doesn’t have the capacity to supply power to the Southern Province for 24 hours."

This practice has caused injustice to law-abiding gem businessmen who dutifully pay their taxes to the Government, the authorities told the committee. The committee discussed issues related to import, export, and re-export in the gem and jewellery sector. MP Ajith Mannapperuma chaired the meeting, and representatives from business associations, the National Gem and Jewellery Authority, the Ministry of Finance, Sri Lanka Customs, and the President’s Senior Additional Secretary (Agriculture and Environment) attended. Mannapperuma stressed the need to restore Sri Lankan gems’ prestigious reputation in foreign countries and to generate foreign exchange through gem exports and re-exports. The Ministry of Finance officials mentioned that a proposed amended bill has been submitted to Parliament, seeking exemption from the 2.5 per cent social security tax imposed on imported gems for re-export. They assured that relief would be provided to businessmen in the future. The committee also learnt that importing precious gems as hand luggage, even with a tax of 2.5 per cent, is more financially advantageous compared to importing by courier. Gem businessmen sometimes resort to cash transactions aboveRs 500,000 to avoid government taxes, impacting those who conduct transparent transactions through banks and adhere to tax regulations. The National Gem and Jewellery Authority revealed that policies are being developed to regulate foreign nationals’ involvement in the local gem industry, and the committee emphasised the urgency of implementing these policies. Further, jewellers requested tax-free imports of gold based on a percentage of their previous years’ export earnings. The Ministry of Finance clarified that businessmen registered with the Board of Investment can obtain permits for temporary gold imports for export processing without import hurdles. Gem businessmen proposed the establishment of a Sri Lankan bank in China or a Chinese bank in Sri Lanka to facilitate their business activities. The representative from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) stated that the Bank of China has been operating in Sri Lanka since 2018, but setting up a Sri Lankan bank in China is challenging given the country’s ongoing economic crisis."

However, despite the promise made, the government cut off the electricity in Mihintale within two days. To fulfil the pledge, the Opposition Leader mentioned that the Rs 4.1 million required for the bill was paid through donations from members of the SJB and other donors. He asserted that the support for historical centres with significant religious, cultural and social values is a priority and should not be limited to mere words. Premadasa criticised the government’s opportunistic use of religion, history, and culture and accused them of abusing religious shrines. He called on the government to immediately cease such abuse and arbitrary activities involving Buddhist and other religious places. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

The Minister revealed this while addressing the media in Kandy on Friday (4). He mentioned that the government is currently assessing the feasibility of granting these investors the opportunity to produce eggs and poultry meat in Sri Lanka in a competitive manner without negatively impacting local businesses. According to the Minister, rather than relying on imports from foreign countries, encouraging foreign investors to establish production industries within the country would be a preferable approach. He also emphasised that the government is open to considering requests not only from India but also from other countries interested in similar investments. Minister Amaraweera highlighted that the rising prices of eggs and chicken were making it difficult for the public to afford them. He said his aim was to provide chicken and eggs at lower prices to the people. Additionally, the Minister disclosed plans for potential egg and chicken exports if there is a surplus. Furthermore, Minister Amaraweera said he expects that in the future, chicken and eggs will be available at even lower prices than the current rates. He mentioned the interest from India’s Amul to initiate a dairy industry in Sri Lanka, and that the government was actively considering the request. BY K.L. Suraweera – Kandy"

Ruhul Haq (SLMC Registration No. 15168) on whom a suspension had been imposed from 20 December 2022 till 20 August 2023 (eight months) could have conducted two important post-mortems during the past six months. However, the SLMC has done its part in informing the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) in writing about the said suspension, while action had not been taken to inform Dr. Haq’s superiors of it. Sources said, action should be taken by the DGHS to inform the Health Secretary, who in turn should instruct the JMO’s superiors of the SLMC’s decision. Ceylon Today, in its 29 July edition, noted that when the late Dinesh Schaffter’s case had been taken up on 9 February, Anuja Premaratne, PC had informed Court that the post-mortem report compiled by JMO Ruhul Haq had been contradictory. He had charged the CID of having sought a post-mortem report from JMO, Dr. Haq, who had been suspended from service for eight months by the SLMC even at that time. According to informed sources, Dr. Haq’s service had been suspended by the Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) following an inquiry into a complaint made by S.A. Rathnasena. The committee at the time had decided that commencing from 20 December 2022, Dr. Ruhul Haq should be suspended for eight months from exercising his rights, privileges, and immunities conferred on him by the registration as a medical practitioner. Several attempts to contact Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella for comment were futile.  Senior medical sources, lashing out, said this whole situation was a result of the Health Ministry being full of medical administrators. “When they should be treating patients, they are engaged in administration and feign to be clueless as to what needs to be done during situations like these,” they charged.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Debt Restructuring activities are underway, and discussions have taken place with leaders from various countries. The goal is not to default on outstanding loans but to gain more time to repay them while finding ways to pay off debts incurred for necessary imports. This necessitates a shift towards a highly competitive export economy,” he said. The President said, the debt optimisation work is in progress, with proposals presented iat the Cabinet and discussions held with the International Monetary Fund and major crediter countries. After parliamentary discussions and amendments, the proposal has been submitted for acceptance. The Committee on Public Finance (COPF) too has actively participated in this process, working diligently regardless of party differences,” he added. Furthermore, he expressed gratitude for the invitation to attend and acknowledged the historical significance of coconut cultivation for Sri Lankan businesses. He highlighted that until 1970, the Sinhalese people held a significant amount of coconut land, but this changed with the land reform of 1972-73, leading to a decline in the capital of Sinhalese businesspersons. He mentioned that during the presidency of J.R. Jayawardena, efforts were made to develop the coconut industry with assistance from the Asian Development Bank. However, he acknowledged that the coconut industry’s progress over the last 50 years has not been satisfactory, contrasting it with other countries such as Brazil and Vietnam that have rapidly advanced in coconut cultivation. President Wickremesinghe emphasised the current situation of coconut farmers in Sri Lanka, with 82% of them owning less than 20 acres of land, while only 18% are engaged in large-scale cultivation. Comparatively, India, which started coconut cultivation with approximately 20 million acres of land in 1950, now has around 45 million acres dedicated to coconuts. He pointed out the significant difference in coconut yield between Sri Lanka and neighbouring regions like Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal. While Sri Lanka’s coconut production stands at 7,000 nuts per acre, these regions are achieving much higher yields, such as 11,400 coconuts per acre in Tamil Nadu and 10,000 coconuts per acre in Telangana."

The reason behind the rush is that many people are lining up to obtain copies of birth certificates for their children in preparation for school admissions next year. Several parents expressed their frustration with this unfortunate situation, blaming it on some school principals in the Galle District who are demanding new birth certificates valid for six months. They alleged that this requirement has caused them to incur additional costs and waste valuable time, as they are forced to wait in long queues, despite having valid birth certificates. When contacted, an official from the Registrar’s Office explained that although a copy of a birth certificate is generally valid for a lifetime, the unusually long queues have emerged due to the insistence of principals from popular schools in Galle for new birth certificates valid for six months. The official said the Education Ministry has allocated new computers to address the issue, and they hope that once the new computers are received, the unusual rush for birth certificates will cease.

The Southern Expressway is one of the busiest in the country. Reliable sources reveal that despite the Expressway being constructed using land acquired by the Road Development Authority (RDA), it has not been officially transferred to the RDA, contravening Section 44 of the Land Acquisition Act. Ownership of the land on which the Expressway stands still remains with the Land Ministry, not yet transferred to the RDA. Notably, a State-owned private company called Sahasya Investments Ltd (SIL), which was gazetted during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s administration, appears to have taken over the Expressway, but an official letter stating the road’s ownership by the RDA has not been issued. As a result, the Expressway has now been handed over to an Indian company through the State-owned private company of the RDA.  To manage the expressways in a more commercial manner, the Cabinet has granted approval for Sri Lanka’s expressways to be shifted from the RDA to a State-owned company called Sahasya Investments Ltd (SIL), established in October 2020. A public-private partnership (PPP) through SIL for expressway management is also executed. It is said that the company SIL has offered the Kottawa-Matara Expressway to the Indian company on a 35-year lease. Due to poor income for RDA from the expressways, the RDA has been relying heavily on the Government budget and has a significant amount of debt guaranteed by the Treasury. To improve its financial position, the RDA is identified for reform and the Cabinet has instructed the RDA to enhance efficiency in budget and human resources use. The proposal involves separating the expressway network, lands, local loans, and staff from the RDA and assigning them to SIL. SIL’s Board is expected to include Independent Directors with relevant expertise and industry knowledge. The Treasury will provide gap financing to SIL until its financial position improves to handle loan repayments. Additionally, SIL is expected to explore new strategies, including the use of idle land for generating renewable energy, it has been revealed. Also the government has introduced Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) packages for staff and that has been rejected by the trade unions before. Prior to 2015 the VRS was introduced but however, that was not implemented.  Once again a VRS package has been introduced for those who served the RDA between 5 to 10 years, sources said. The RDA is tasked with revaluing its road network and improving transparency in business operations and financial reporting, with regular financial statements. Any transfers from the Government to the RDA will be reflected in the national budget, aligning with fiscal targets under the IMF Extended Fund Facility. In the meantime, the Director General of RDA has written all the executive officers attached to the RDA on 20 July about certain officials of the RDA having behaved in an unbecoming manner and thus tarnishing the image of the institution whenever responding to inquiries made by the media, responding to public inquiries and complaints. As a result of it henceforth all heads of various branches of the RDA ought to appraise all employees of the different types of activities performed by their units and there should not be any room left for any junior officer not to be unaware of such services. Henceforth if either, the media, public or any outside individual were to inquire into activities of the RDA all such information should be released in a responsible manner and the officials should ensure that their responses does not bring the RDA into disrepute or tarnish its images in the eyes of the public. Furthermore, supplying of official information either to the media or the public should be undertaken as per Section 6 of the Establishments Code XLVII and also when inquiries are made as per the RTI Act responses to such inquiries should be provided within a stipulated time frame and if certain responses need adequate time then the inquirer should be informed accordingly.

ICA is an embodiment of cultural exchange, mutual respect, and understanding. Established with the vision of fostering a sense of belonging among expatriates, this association has become a melting pot of diverse traditions, customs, and beliefs. One of the primary goals of ICA is to bridge the gap between cultures. Indian Expatriates with different backgrounds and walks of life come together to share their unique experiences, customs, and traditions. Through a myriad of events and activities, such as cultural festivals, language exchanges, and culinary workshops, the association cultivates an environment where members can learn from each other, thus creating a close-knit community of global citizens. Moving to a foreign land can be both exciting and challenging, and ICA recognises the importance of creating a supportive network. By embracing newcomers and providing them with opportunities to engage in social events, the association enables them to adapt more smoothly to their new surroundings and build meaningful connections. While expatriates have embraced their host country, the association also emphasises the preservation of their own cultural heritage. From celebrating traditional festivals to organising art exhibitions and performances, members of the Indian Cultural Association take pride in sharing their roots with the local community. This exchange enriches the cultural landscape of Colombo and promotes a greater appreciation for diversity. Beyond cultural exchange, the association is deeply committed to giving back to the local community. Collaborating with various charitable organisations, the Indian Cultural Association organises CSR events and volunteering initiatives. These efforts demonstrate the association’s dedication to being responsible global citizens and making a positive impact on the lives of those in need."

During the inspection of these two people at the counter of Omani passengers, they were arrested by the CID as the female passenger had a printed copy of an Indian visa and an Indian air ticket and an Omani tourist visa and an Omani air ticket.

MCPA President Dr. Chamal Sanjeeva on Friday (30) said that the Health Ministry’s Medical Supply Division (MSD) of the Ministry of Health and the State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC) were preparing to purchase close to 100,000 lenses in several steps to be used for eye surgeries in hospitals in the island. However, the procurement process of the purchase will allegedly cost more than Rs 100 million above the normal price. He urged the Auditor General to take immediate measures by intervening in the matter while advising the Health Ministry to temporarily stop this procurement process and conduct such transactions with transparency. Of the amounts quoted for tenders GHC/C/S/WW/6/21, closed on 4 April 2023 and DHS/RS/RQ/73/23 closed on 28 April 2023, the tender was allegedly awarded to the latter pharmaceutical company which had submitted a bid to supply a lens at a cost of Rs 10,350 per lens. The MCPA President said that the other company bidding for the tender had quoted a little over Rs 9,000 per lens. The MCPA President lamented that the government would be paying more than Rs 100 million for the 100,000 lenses incurring heavy losses to the Treasury. “It is unfortunate for people of this country that they could not even prevent the loss of about Rs 1.2 billion rupees more than the normal price for an antibiotic on a past occasion. The procurement report notes that one company quoted as much as Rs 35,000 rupees per lens, he said noting that the Auditor General’s Department should take strong decision to put a stop to such questionable procurement procedures. Corrupt politicians and their officials were quite aware that no action could be taken against them despite the probes that have been carried out by Parliamentary Select Committees and the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) in the past. The procurement procedures had already been completed by the time the probes were carried out.  Dr. Sanjeeva urged the President to look into how officials carry out these allegedly crooked deals without any doubt or fear in a situation where the corruption, fraud irregularities of the Health Ministry were being continuously revealed through the media.

The auspicious inauguration ceremony, set to commence on 31 July, at 10.00 a.m. will be attended by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, as well as Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Qi Zhenhong. The renovation project marks another milestone in strengthening the long-standing diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and the People’s Republic of China. Back in 1988, the Supreme Court complex was initially built as a grant from the previous Chinese Government and handed over to Sri Lanka. Moreover, in 2016, an agreement was signed between the Government of Sri Lanka and the People’s Republic of China, paving the way for extensive renovations to the High Court complex. The renovation will be conducted in two phases and is expected to be completed within 32 months, targeting a finishing date in 2025. The initial phase will focus on the Court of Appeal area, followed by the second phase, which will address the renovation needs of the Supreme Court section. The agreement was signed on 21 December 2021, between the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China, the Ministry of Justice, and the China International Economic Cooperation Agency to facilitate the reform activities. Renovation efforts were made in 2012, mainly on the renovation of roofing, security booths, plumbing system, and electrical system of the Supreme Court complex.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

South Africa were cruising to a historic first win in five matches at the World Cup after goals by Linda Motlhalo and Thembi Kgatlana either side of half-time in Dunedin, New Zealand. But Argentina pulled one back via a stunning Sophia Braun strike in the 74th minute and then drew level five minutes later when Romina Nunez headed home. South Africa also threw away the lead, and then conceded the decisive goal in the last minute, to lose 2-1 to Sweden in their opening match. “It is about taking our chances, making better decisions in the final third. If we take our chances we have a different conversation,” coach Desiree Ellis said. “Today was a great opportunity to put ourselves a step ahead, but it is not all lost.” Appearing at their fourth World Cup, Argentina have still never won in 11 attempts themselves. “I am really proud of how we came back, we never gave up. We showed a lot of heart,” said Braun, Argentina’s US-born full-back. After losing their opening matches in New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa have one point each in Group G. Favourites Sweden and Italy have three points before playing each other in Wellington on Saturday, before a decisive final round of games on 2 August. Captain Kosovare Asllani warned her Sweden team won’t back down in the face of Italy’s physical approach. A victory for either will be enough to qualify for the knockout phase, but Italy-based Asllani said her team will need to come through a rigorous examination. Experienced AC Milan midfielder Asllani – the only outfield Swedish player in Italy’s top flight – has warned her team-mates to expect some old-fashioned Italian treatment. “I’m quite used to that type of football. It’s very focused on man-marking and we know that there will be tough situations,” she said. “We never turn down the offer of a physical game so we’re very much looking forward to it,” she added.  (Agencies)"

According to the assessment by the AidData research project at William & Mary University in Virginia, the Hambantota Port in the South Asian nation is the most probable location for a base, given China’s significant investment of USD 2.19 billion in the port. Currently, China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has only one overseas military base in Djibouti, located on the Horn of Africa’s coast. However, amid the escalating rivalry between the US and China, Beijing is striving to catch up with Washington’s overseas maritime strength. Unlike the US, China is not a participant in international defence alliances, with its only formal defence treaty being with North Korea. This makes the development of overseas naval bases a crucial priority for China’s military advancement, as highlighted by the AidData researchers. China’s future ambitions for PLAN may be closely linked to its belt and road initiative. Out of the eight bases shortlisted by AidData, four are located in Africa. While China’s immediate maritime interests lie in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, the report’s authors suggest that these operations could be conducted “entirely from the Chinese mainland and home naval bases.” However, having PLAN bases in more distant locations would enable China to safeguard shipping routes, particularly in the face of potential western sanctions, and enhance their intelligence-gathering capabilities."

Speaking to Ceylon Today, Dr. Perera lamented that the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children appealed to parents to have their children vaccinated. The LRH receives patients who have not even been administered the BCG vaccine (Bacille Calmette-Guerin, administered to prevent childhood tuberculous meningitis), he said. Every country runs a risk of there being one or two allergic reactions to the vaccine. There is a one-in-a-million chance of such incidents.  This does not mean that parents should take the risk of not giving their children the right vaccines at the right time, he stressed. Failure to do so would only result in endangering the community they lived in. He warned that not having these vaccines would leave children venerable to other diseases. Citing an example, Dr. Perera said by refraining from getting vaccinated against Rubella, mothers left their children vulnerable to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) resulting in miscarriage, stillbirth, and severe birth defects such as cataracts, blindness, congenital heart disease, deafness, and even mental retardation. “Therefore, don’t be duped or cowed down by myths regarding childhood vaccines. Obtaining the MMR vaccine would not result in the child contracting autism as some parents wrongly believe,” Dr. Perera said. Having children unvaccinated would take the State health service back several years with hospitals having to open wards for polio and tetanus cases in addition to the present disease load they were battling with, he warned.

EC members were also directed to come-up with a plan to reduce the time span between the nomination date and the polling date after a study tour in Europe. He has told this to the EC members at a meeting held with the participation of officials of the Attorney General’s Department and the Finance Ministry. “How much financial provision is required to hold a Presidential Election next year? We have to prepare the Appropriation Bill 2024 by incorporating funds needed to be allocated for the election,” he added. Election Commission officials, led by Chairman R.M.L. Ratnayake, have pledge to prepare the estimates and present those at the earliest. The President also advised EC members to forward it to the Ministry of Finance immediately, and to discuss the matter further with the Ministry of Finance as well. Meanwhile, Presidential Secretary Saman Ekanayake has instructed the Election Commission to prepare a system to reduce the time spent on elections from the time nominations are accepted to the polling day. Giving further instructions, Ekanayake had told them to prepare this system by taking examples from countries with advanced electoral systems in the Europe. Sri Lanka is a country that has longer election period. Once the elections are announced the entire State mechanism focuses of the election spending money, time and labour on it. Humongous amount of funds are spent as longer it takes bigger the costs are, Ekanayake pointed out while adding this leads to hinder the day-to-day normal lives of the ordinary public.  Ekanayake, therefore told the EC members to prepare an election system that ends in shorter time span. “Go to European countries with best election system and study if the necessity arises and the Presidential Secretariat will facilitate the tour. Give us a thorough report on it,” he added.

The project involved acquiring the Muturajawela marsh, a bird sanctuary located north of Colombo, under the authority of the Urban Development Authority (UDA). However, the decision sparked controversy and protests, prompting President Wickremesinghe to intervene. He instructed the UDA to prepare a Cabinet Paper to reverse the gazetting and acquisition process for the Muthurajawela land, noted Herath. According to UDA Chairman Herath, the Cabinet Paper for the de-gazetting process was submitted two weeks ago, but was deferred by the Cabinet for further review. Currently, the Cabinet is seeking final observations from the Finance Ministry before proceeding with the de-gazetting process. Initially, the UDA had plans to develop the area as a wetland and have it declared under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. However, the release of an Extraordinary Gazette on 7 October 2021 allowing the UDA to acquire the Muthurajawela marsh was met with criticism, even from the Colombo Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith. The UDA’s development projects covered a 30-acre area in the wetlands, including the construction of a small wewa, canals, access roads, and bridges. This prompted several Fundamental Rights petitions to be filed in the Supreme Court, challenging the legality of the Gazette Notification that allowed the UDA to acquire the Muthurajawela marsh. The UDA has been entrusted to the development plan of the entire Western Province and this is one of the lands that has been earmarked to be de-gazetted. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Health Ministry Additional Secretary Dr. Saman Ratnayake said on Friday (21), although the Indian-based company, from which the regional anaesthetic had been purchased, claimed that the death may have occurred as the proper solution of Bupivacaine and glucose solution not being used, the possibilities of such an eventuality was very slim. The possibilities were more that cardio toxicity one of the side effects of the drug may have led to the mother’s death, he noted.   Dr. Ratnayake noted that registration of the drug had not been renewed since 2016. The company had not been given the tender to import the drug twice since and thereby the registration of the drug had not been renewed. However, with the urgency with which the anaesthetic had been required in Sri Lanka, measures had been taken to import it.

Speaking in Parliament, Fernando highlighted that these companies currently hold a monopoly in the market, making them powerful players and stressed the need to introduce competition to establish competitive pricing for flour. He proposed a solution to address the situation, suggesting that at least 30 per cent of flour imports should be allocated to other importers, while the remaining 70 per cent should go to the two main companies. This distribution would help maintain a competitive price for flour in the market. He also recalled a past instance when the import of flour was not banned and they were able to provide a kilo of flour at Rs 165, at a time when flour prices had soared to Rs 430. However, the Finance Ministry later imposed a ban on flour imports and introduced a licence system. The Minister emphasised that the issuance of licenses should be managed by the Finance Ministry to address the situation effectively. The Minister’s response came in reply to a question raised by MP Dayasiri Jayasekara, who asked about the undue profit earned by the two companies through their monopoly in the flour import market, and the government losing revenue due to the removal of the Rs 35 tax.

This new commission would be created through new legislation. According to the Chairman of the Select Committee, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the proposed National Higher Education Commission should comprise 11 members appointed by the President with prior approval from the Constitutional Council. These members should be eminent individuals in their respective fields, encompassing academia, professions, and management expertise. The Commission, in turn, should be divided into four sub-committees, namely a State University Committee, Non-State University Committee, Vocational Education Institutions Committee, and a sub-committee dedicated to quality assurance. Furthermore, the Select Committee recommends the establishment of universities under public-private partnerships, along with a restructuring of the administrative system of State universities. This restructuring aims to delegate responsibilities for finance, good governance, accountability, and transparency, while preserving the autonomy of these universities. Additionally, the proposal includes the establishment of Virtual Universities. As part of the educational evaluation system, the Select Committee suggests the implementation of a mixed evaluation approach. Under this system, students would be evaluated based on both examinations and continuous assessments. Apart from higher education, the Select Committee has also directed its attention to early childhood education and primary/secondary education. The recommendations include the establishment of monitoring bodies for early childhood education institutions and private schools. These recommendations, if implemented, aim to enhance and reform the higher education landscape in the country, making it more robust, transparent, and responsive to the evolving needs of students and society, Rajapakshe said.

The IRD official also added that according to the Legacy Computer System, around 76 per cent of the income or Rs 1.7 billion accrued via tax arrears, fines and interest has also been suspended. He thus added that the suspension imposed on the levying of tax arrears, fines and interest has resulted in the Government losing a colossal amount. He said, this loss of revenue to the State could be described as unprecedented due to the actions undertaken by the IRD. He further noted that the failure of the IRD to achieve its set targets annually has worsened issues and stressed that if this trend is not corrected shortly the sole purpose of setting up the IRD will be lost. Efforts made by this newspaper to contact the Commissioner General of the IRD on 145 occasions were futile and of those 145 times, the IRD Chief had allegedly attended IRD Board Meetings on 65 occasions while on 12 occasions, he had gone out of his office premises.

The 7th and the 25th named accused in the Easter Sunday attacks Trial-at-Bar, Rasheed Mohommad Ibrahim and Mohamed Akram Ahakkam represented by M.M. Zuhair, PC and Attorney-at-Law Rizwan Uwaiz filed the said bail applications in the Court of Appeal on 21 February. The applications were heard by Justice P. Kumaratnam and Justice Sampath Abeykoon, and the preliminary objections taken up by the State were overruled on 16 June. The Attorney General filed the aforesaid Special Leave to Appeal application against the order of the Court of Appeal stating that the power of the Court of Appeal to consider bail in respect of a suspect under Section 15B of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary) Provisions Act No. 48 of 1979, is ousted by Section 450 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act when the accused is facing their trial before a Trial-at-Bar constituted by the Chief Justice on the request of the Attorney General considering the public importance of a matter. The Attorney General also argued that the accused – respondents were barred from invoking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as they have already invoked the bail jurisdiction of the Trial-at-Bar. It was argued that an accused who has resorted to invoking the jurisdiction of the Trial-at-Bar has a remedy provided by the Legislature to go to the Supreme Court in appeal if they are aggrieved by an order of the High Court at Bar. Respondents argued that under Article 128 of the Constitution, the Attorney General could not have come before the Supreme Court seeking Special Leave to Appeal as the order of the Court of Appeal does not amount to a final order. They also argued that the Court of Appeal under Article 138 (2) of the Constitution read with Section 15B of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary) Provisions Act is also vested with the jurisdiction to consider bail in respect of the accused named before a Trial-at-Bar. Respondents further contended the Court of Appeal has provided adequate and rational reasons in overruling the preliminary objections of the State. Having heard both parties, the Supreme Court granted Special Leave to Appeal on the grounds urged by the Attorney General, and deemed it fit to grant the interim relief sought by the Attorney General to stay the proceedings of the Court of Appeal until the hearing of this matter. Supreme Court fixed the case for argument on 14 September. The Respondents were represented by M.M. Zuhair, PC and Attorney-at-Law Rizwan Uwaiz, while the Attorney General was represented by Additional Solicitor General Harippriya Jayasundara, PC assisted by SC Akila Dalpathadu, SC Shakthi Jagodaarachchi and SC Sajith Bandara."

AHP President, Ravi Kumudesh, on Friday (14), said the Health Minister, the Director General of Health Services (DGHS), and himself included could face a similar situation in near future. “Therefore, pay attention to finding a solution and quickly prepare a mechanism for the public to clear their doubts regarding the present crisis regarding pharmaceuticals,” he said.  The 38-year-old had been admitted due to an infection he had developed, while being treated at Karapitiya. It is suspected that his death may have been a result of further complications due to an infection in the cannula site. Kumudesh lamented that this incident had made evident that health workers were also victims of this crisis. “While deeply saddened by his death, we must collectively acknowledge that there is a crisis in the health service that requires serious attention,” he said.  Noting that his outfit was not afraid to say that the cause of death was an inferior type of cannula or to stress that it was a problem with the quality of medicines administered, he added that it is extremely alarming when a patient who had gone home after receiving treatment for his illness, dies unexpectedly due to an issue related to the hospital that he had sought treatment from. Informed medical sources said, a cannula was used under highly sterile conditions.  Meanwhile, a five-member committee was appointed by the Health Ministry to probe the death of 21-year-old Chamodi Sandeepani, who passed away, while receiving treatment at Teaching Hospital Peradeniya. The committee was scheduled to visit the hospital on Saturday (15), to conduct investigations. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

This glaring discrepancy represents an alarming difference of nearly 3000% between the estimated and actual costs of these avian acquisitions. COPA shed light on concerning irregularities in the procurement process of birds, by the Department of National Zoological Gardens, between 2018 and 2020.  The Committee highlighted that due to a requirement to procure 32 types of birds from a specific supplier, the Department incurred a loss of nearly 17 million rupees as the birds had to be purchased at significantly higher prices. This revelation was made during a COPA meeting chaired by Lasantha Alagiyawanna in Parliament, where the Auditor General’s report and the Department’s current performance were examined. Expressing concern over the substantial gap between estimated and actual costs, the Committee questioned why such a significant difference occurred, especially considering the department’s understanding of the subject matter and market conditions. The COPA Chair stressed the need for a detailed report on this matter and the issuance of an internal circular to ensure accurate assessments in future procurements. The Committee further emphasised the urgent need to amend the Act governing the National Zoological Gardens, particularly to address the incorporation of new zoological parks. The COPA Chair directed the Compilation Department to coordinate with relevant stakeholders and submit a comprehensive report on this matter before 5 August. During the meeting, the need for proper classification of the Zoological Department’s income was also highlighted. The Auditor General instructed that income from tickets and other activities should be presented separately to ensure transparency. Concerning the conservation of endangered animals, the Committee Chair informed that the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation, Ministry of Environment, Department of Wildlife Conservation, and Department of National Zoological Gardens should jointly appoint a committee and develop a comprehensive programme. The regular updating of information on endangered animals in the country, following the guidelines of the IUCN Red Data Book, was also stressed, urging the conduction of a comprehensive national survey in this regard. Attention was drawn to issues at the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage, Wagolla Pinnawala Zoo, and Ridiyagama Safari Park. Notably, out of the 900 animals in Ridiyagama Safari Park, 485 have not been properly identified as male or female. It was revealed that over 300 of these animals are star tortoises from India, currently under the custody of the zoo pending legal proceedings. Additionally, the Committee Chair instructed the swift filling of vacancies, particularly in the safari park, where there is currently only one veterinarian. Furthermore, due to the lack of a proper strategic plan, the Chair directed the preparation of a new plan for the years 2024-2030, with completion expected by 31 December this year."

This was revealed when queried about a recent complaint, with regard to an incident of buying an antibiotic vaccine worth Rs 500, from a pharmacy in Kandy for Rs 5,000 for the Kandy Teaching Hospital, violating the procurement process of the hospital. The Ministry of Health has commenced an investigation into the said incident, the official said. Ceylon Today learns that several complaints have received regarding similar incidents from the hospitals across the country. When the said information system was in operation, the quantity of drugs available, their locations, exchanges etc. were updated, so the medicinal drugs could be maintained. In the event of a shortage, the hospital directors are allowed to buy some drugs from outside with the approval of the State Pharmaceutical Corporation, said the official. He said, at present there is no such management but complaints are being received that some directors are procuring medicines at different prices. Meanwhile, during a recent media briefing, held at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella said, the information system established in 2021, in the medical supply sector, which cost millions, is currently inactive. “An inquiry is currently underway regarding this matter.

In response, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella denied the existence of inferior quality medicines. Premadasa highlighted a tragic incident where a woman from Galle died after being administered Propofol, a drug that reportedly failed quality tests. He emphasised that another death occurred due to the use of substandard medicines, despite Rambukwella’s claims to the contrary. Propofol was one of three drugs that failed sample quality tests. Premadasa expressed his frustration over the lack of a proper mechanism to lodge complaints or investigate incidents involving substandard medicines. He called for the establishment of an effective system to address such issues. Additionally, he held the NMRA’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer responsible for the situation, alleging that they should be held accountable for their role in overseeing the regulatory authority.

Dissanayake criticised the notion that these cases were withdrawn on technical grounds, asserting that the influence of the political authorities in power had led to law enforcement agencies being swayed. “The Bribery or Corruption Commission filed 94 cases in 2019, and four of them were withdrawn. In 2020, 55 cases were filed, with three withdrawals. In 2021, 69 cases were filed, but 42 were withdrawn. Similarly, in 2022, 71 cases were filed, but 46 were withdrawn. The stated reasons for withdrawal were technical grounds, yet this is not a legal problem. These institutions have been completely under political influence,” he alleged. Dissanayake questioned how the Attorney General’s Department, its lawyers, and the law enforcement agencies could become politically influenced. “When a new government comes to power, promising investigations, they end up imprisoning former CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekere for two to three years, fearing that he would expose the wrongdoings of the previous government’s criminals. Where is the safety of these officials? As soon as a new government assumes power, these officials are incarcerated, accusing them of conducting investigations incorrectly and intending to imprison those responsible due to political motives. Is this a legal issue? It reflects the ugly and corrupt nature of politics,” he alleged. He emphasised the need to change this political culture, pointing out instances where prime ministers of other countries, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, have been imprisoned for large-scale corruption and fraud. Dissanayake questioned why local government members in Sri Lanka do not face similar consequences and whether there is a flaw in the law. Furthermore, Dissanayake accused the governments in power of protecting criminals and stated, “Plans are being made regarding whom to sue, how to file cases, and how to conduct investigations. Economic crimes have occurred in our country, and the common people have become the biggest victims.” He highlighted instances where patients become blind after receiving medicine from hospitals and criticised the irresponsibility of certain ministers who claim they have been providing such medicine for years, after patients have died.

He urged the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) to announce the reason for the alleged heart attack she is said to have suffered during surgery at the NEH.  The MCPA President said that the Health Ministry’s explanation, with regard to the death that occurred at the Eye Hospital, was unacceptable as forensic science reports given regarding such controversial deaths in Sri Lanka were altered subsequently. Dr. Sanjeewa alleged that the death of a patient at the National Eye hospital, during an operation, was suspected to be the result of an anaesthetic drug and urged the Ministry to conduct an impartial investigation and reveal the truth to the public. He urged the President’s to pay attention to the collapse that was occurring in the State health service. “It is the misfortune of Sri Lankan citizens that the country’s leader was failing to pay due attention to the State health system at a time it was facing the worst collapse in the island’s history,” he lamented. Dr. Sanjeewa accused the Health Secretary of having initiated disciplinary action against him and attempting to conceal the truth when in December of last year his outfit had revealed of the damage being caused by the importation of substandard and unregistered drugs to Sri Lanka, of bringing drugs without proper scientific analysis reports and without the supervision of expert advisory committees, endangering the lives of patients and burdening the tax payers of this country. It could be considered reasonable for the public to fear that even the deaths that occur under normal conditions in State-run hospitals were due to complications of medicinal drugs or low quality drugs, Dr. Sanjeewa said, noting that the current health administration had no moral right to play with the lives of the people under a situation where the Health Ministry had accepted that unregistered drugs were coming into our country. The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) itself was admittedly giving the green light to import medicines sans proper laboratory testing, he alleged. Sources revealed that a patient H.G. Himali Priyadarshini Weerasinghe (35), a mother of two, from Kosgoda Boralukatiya South, died following eye surgery at the National Eye Hospital, Colombo (NEH). The patient had undergone surgery to insert a lens earlier at the NEH, Colombo and had been admitted to the hospital for another operation due to an allergic reaction in the eye, which had been operated. She had been admitted to the hospital on the same day for a second surgery which had been carried out on Wednesday (5). However the patient had died during the surgery without even regaining consciousness, they said. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Dr. Bellana on Friday (7), alleged that it was difficult to say as to whether this situation had arisen due to the Health Minister’s lack of knowledge or the crazy advice of the henchmen closest to him that he did not seem to realise that the Health service should have a zero level of defects. One cannot afford to give excuses like the drug had been in use for a long period and was being used in many countries, he noted.  “Hopefully the Health Minister does not hope to pay compensation using public funds. It would be highly unacceptable to use public money- people’s tax money when the fault lies entirely with the Health Ministry and the companies that sold such substandard medicinal drugs, the GMOF President observed. If Minister Rambukwella was to be appointed to the portfolio of Civil Aviation it would be highly shocking if he were to give such shockingly lame excuses when a airplane crashed. One cannot say that the flight had travelled to this many countries and carried this many passengers up until that unfortunate moment, he lashed out.  Dr. Bellana lamented that the Minister seemed to be submerged in a den of corrupt officials and was misadvised. He noted that if the Minister was expecting a strike this September in the Health Sector, it was mainly due to his bad handling of the State health service.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of CTU, highlighted the major predicament faced by principals and teachers, due to the lack of the necessary funds. Stalin asserted that certain schools had to bear an exorbitant cost to administer the previous term tests and that the Ministry of Education is urging teachers to charge students for the upcoming tests. Additionally, he claimed that a significant expense is associated with printing question papers for the term examinations. Consequently, unless timely funding is provided, schools, other than the affluent ones, on the island, will be unable to conduct these examinations. Expressing disappointment, Stalin said the Ministry has not yet supplied the required funds. He acknowledges that the Ministry’s proposal is to charge students for the exams, but believes that teachers cannot impose such fees. Given the on-going crisis, parents are already facing numerous difficulties in sending their children to school, making it an unjust to burden them with examination fees. While reputed schools may have the means to bear these expenses impoverished schools will struggle to do so, he stressed. Stalin further alleged that the government prioritises other activities over education, reflected in its inadequate attention and allocation of funds. He questioned whether free education still exists in Sri Lanka today, citing incidents like these as evidence of the government’s neglect of education. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/07/01/srilankan-set-to-finalise-agreement-with-foreign-airline/,SriLankan set to finalise agreement with foreign airline,Author not found,0,2023-06-30T20:35:00+00:00," SriLankan Airlines is set to finalise an agreement with a foreign airline within the next two months, according to Minister of Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva. In an interview with Ceylon Today, the Minister clarified that SriLankan Airlines will retain a majority stake of 51 per cent. The Minister acknowledged that out of the fleet of 27 Airbus aircraft owned by SriLankan Airlines, only 16 are currently in operational condition. However, complications have arisen during negotiations regarding the restructuring of the airline. The investors interested in the process have expressed a desire to operate other airline services, including SriLankan Catering and Ground Handling services, in addition to the airline itself. Minister de Silva emphasised that he has chosen not to agree to any conditions that would be detrimental to Sri Lanka’s interests while collaborating with a foreign airline to run SriLankan Airlines. To address these challenges, a dedicated committee from the Treasury has been appointed to oversee the restructuring of the airline. Their primary objective is to devise on a comprehensive plan to ensure the long-term viability and success of SriLankan Airlines. Meanwhile, the Minister, during a media briefing, at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), said SriLankan Airlines employees’ jobs would be at risk if immediate restructuring  measures are not implemented. The minister expressed concerns about the potential loss of jobs for approximately 6,000 employees at SriLankan Airlines if immediate restructuring  measures are not implemented. The minister emphasised that the government cannot sustain the financial losses incurred by SriLankan Airlines and it would be unfair to continue using taxpayer funds in this manner. To address the situation, the government has already initiated efforts to engage the support of international financial experts, with the aim of conducting the restructuring process in a transparent manner, as part of their commitment to building a stable country. He said: “SriLankan Airlines, established as our national carrier many years ago, holds a unique position. While it managed to generate a profit of Rs 30 million during the period it was under the control of Emirates Airlines, it has struggled to achieve profitability otherwise. The airline is primarily funded by the taxes of ordinary citizens, including those who have never experienced air travel. We take pride in having our own national airline, but we must question whether the cost associated with maintaining it is justified. Presently, SriLankan Airlines carries a debt of USD 1.2 billion.  Various organisations, including local State banks, have had to cover outstanding payments for international bonds and leased planes. Additionally, we have accumulated unpaid fuel bills. Operating an airline under such immense debt is unsustainable.” Due to economic challenges, including foreign exchange difficulties, the government is unable to provide financial support for losses as it has done in the past. This approach is no longer equitable, which led to the decision to restructure SriLankan Airlines. The restructuring plan entails the government retaining a 51 per cent share, with the remaining 49 per cent to be offered to another investor. The proposal for the restructuring process of SriLankan Airlines was submitted to the Cabinet six months ago. Although some profits are generated through ground operations and SriLankan Catering Company, they are insufficient to cover the airline’s losses. “Considering the need to sell shares separately and the memorandum presented to the Cabinet, a series of proposals have been forwarded to international financial experts through the Ministry of Finance. We are committed to transparently maximise the benefits of this process. The completion of the SriLankan Airlines restructuring is anticipated within the next six months. It will then be transferred to the identified investor under conditions that safeguard the rights of employees. Through this initiative, we aspire to enhance the performance of SriLankan Airlines. Failure to undertake this task promptly puts the jobs of approximately 6000 employees at risk,” the minister pointed out. The airline industry worldwide experienced a severe setback due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Tourists ceased to visit countries, and many nations had to ground their planes. In fact, even Qatar Airways had to lay off 72 pilots. In contrast, our government ensured that our pilots received half their salaries, even when they were not actively flying.  This gesture was driven by a humanitarian approach, he added. Following the Covid-19 epidemic, our country faced immense challenges, including a decline in tourist arrivals. However, under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the government successfully navigated these difficulties and revitalised tourism through the efforts of SriLankan Airlines. As a result, tourists gradually began returning to our country, the minister said. BY J.T. de Silva"

Speaking on the matter, Media Spokesperson of Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe accused the particular consultant of having shown such questionable behaviour in other stations that she served in. “Having joined the LRH a few years ago, medical officers and staff had been compelled to complain to the hospital’s administration to no avail. It was as a last resort that the Union appealed to the DGHS calling for his intervention in resolving the issue in the particular ward. Since this is an internal issue, it is the LRH administration which should resolve it. But unfortunately failure on the part of the administration to take action had forced the GMOA to appeal for the Director General’s intervention.” He said on Friday (30), that the questionable behaviour of a Consultant in Ward 8B had resulted in a strained situation in the ward for the past two months till his outfit had decided to intervene in the matter and complain to the Director General Health Services (DGHS) nearly two weeks ago. Dr. Wijesinghe alleged that ‘inefficiency and irresponsible’ behaviour of the Administration at Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children has placed the staff of ward 8B in a predicament. Dr. Wijesinghe noted that the DGHS, Dr. Asela Gunawardena had provided two solutions to resolve the issue without interfering in the functioning of the ward. Of which one was the initiation of an investigation by a committee appointed by him (the DGHS) and the other was to instruct the Administration on how the matter should be handled. But unfortunately the administration has failed to carry out the DGHS’s instructions till date and is not even acting on the instructions of the DGHS, he alleged. Dr. Wijesinghe said, the union on the previous occasion had taken trade union action without disrupting the ward’ but tos functions hoping that the situation would improve to no avail. Meanwhile, the Hospital Administration noted that a Ministerial investigation into the consultants conduct had been launched.

The Cabinet on 30 May granted approval for Akira Airlines, an Israeli-based airline, to operate in Sri Lanka. Israeli flights typically carry on board armed security personnel for the safety of their passengers. However, Sri Lanka does not permit armed security from another country to disembark at the BIA with weapons. Chairman Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority Priantha Fernando said, that the government has been checking with other countries that welcome Israeli airlines, to understand how they manage this situation. “Given the significant security threat Israel faces, their security personnel will be on the flight and will inspect the cargo that will be carried back to Israel. They have expressed the need to check the cargo loaded onto their flights at BIA, which requires their armed security personnel to disembark and enter the airport premises. They will undergo the necessary security checks and assess the safety measures in place,” the STDA Chairman said. Earlier, the airline was not allowed to commence flights from Sri Lanka due to security reasons; Airlines had two security guards in the planes – this was not permitted in Sri Lanka due to security reasons. The negotiations have been on-going for over six months with Akira Airlines. They had consistently explained their requirement to have armed security personnel on board. According to Sri Lanka Tourism, 8,818 Israelis arrived in Sri Lanka. “These numbers are expected to increase with the introduction of direct flights from Israel. Their requests and clearances went through the Defence Ministry, involving both civil aviation and defence authorities, while we focussed on the tourism perspective. Regarding security at the BIA arrival and departure; Sri Lanka has indeed tightened security measures due to the threats faced. This is justified as they aim to prevent any potential acts of violence. In the past, even Swiss Air had armed security on board their flights,” the SLTDA Chairman told Ceylon Today.

The decision, subject to certain conditions, will result in an overall reduction of 14.2 per cent, providing relief to consumers across various categories. The Chairman of the PUCSL revealed the revised tariff structure, highlighting the specific reductions for different consumer segments. Notably, consumers falling under the category of using less than 30 units will benefit from a remarkable 65 per cent reduction in costs. For consumers in the bracket of 31 to 60 units, the tariff will be charged at 51.5 per cent of the total cost. Similarly, those consuming electricity between 61 and 90 units will enjoy a reduction of 24.5 per cent. In a move to support the hotel sector, a reduction of 26.3 per cent will be imposed on their electricity tariffs. Additionally, the PUCSL outlined several other conditions related to the 2023 tariff revision. The industrial category will see a nine per cent reduction, while commercial buildings will benefit from a five per cent reduction. Religious purposes will experience an overall reduction of 16 per cent, and government institutions will see a modest 0.8 per cent reduction. Recognising the importance of accurate billing, the PUCSL urged the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity Company (LECO) to promptly implement measures to ensure that residents of all condominium properties are billed according to their respective tariff categories. The commission also emphasised the need for metering or estimating streetlight consumption and directed the Local Authority or Road Development Authority to be billed accordingly. Furthermore, the PUCSL emphasised the investment of security deposits obtained from consumers, with interest being paid from the returns on these investments. The interest accrued on security deposits will be paid or deducted from the monthly electricity bills of all consumers. To ensure a stable and reliable power supply, the PUCSL directed the execution of fuel supply agreements with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Lanka Coal Company. Additionally, Power Purchase Agreements between CEB transmission and CEB generation plants, as well as Power Sales Agreements between Distribution Licensees and CEB Transmission Licensee, are to be established. The PUCSL said, it was important to settle all outstanding payments to renewable energy-based electricity generators, including small-scale rooftop solar providers, as soon as possible. These tariff revisions and conditions aim to provide relief to electricity consumers in Sri Lanka, easing their financial burden, while supporting the development of a sustainable and efficient power sector in the country.

OPA serves as the apex body of professionals in Sri Lanka, representing 52 professional associations across 33 disciplines. These associations cover over 60,000 professionals who hold key decision-making positions in both the public and private sectors of the country. The main theme of this year’s Annual Conference is ‘Sri Lanka’s Challenging Path towards Economic Recovery and Stability’.  The chosen theme, along with the sub-themes in the Technical Sessions, addresses timely issues that require brainstorming and discussions among professionals in Sri Lanka. The goal is to propose and recommend adaptive management strategies to overcome the existing economic crisis. All professionals have a mandatory obligation to facilitate a way forward by implementing mitigating yet sustainable measures that focus on achieving speedy economic recovery and stability. The inaugural session, which will take place in the evening of 9 August, will be graced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who will be the Chief Guest.

Speaking during a media briefing, MP Ashok Abeysinghe claimed that despite the Government’s initial declaration that they would not touch the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and refrain from local debt restructuring, they have now gone back on their word. “What the Government had promised to the people has been completely reversed. From the beginning, we advised the government that if we were to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it should have been done in early 2020. By doing so, only Sri Lanka and the IMF would have had to sign an agreement. However, without heeding our advice, the country declared bankruptcy, leading to the involvement of a third party in addition to the agreement,” he stated. He further explained that the IMF initially deemed the country’s debt as unsustainable and now Sri Lanka has received the first instalment of the IMF loan facility. “The second instalment is yet to be received, and a review must be conducted. It is during this review that foreign creditors are suggesting the restructuring of domestic debt. President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that the foreign debt of seventeen billion dollars is to be restructured. Within our country, there are 8.7 million workers’ welfare funds, with 2.9 million of them being EPF accounts, which have now reduced to 400,000 active accounts,” he added. It is these 2.2 million active EPF accounts that the Government has decided to restructure due to the decrease in employment opportunities, he alleged. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

The operation was carried out using a toad collecting licence under the supervision of the Excise Department. The investigation revealed that this illegal liquor had been distributed in Aluthgama, Kalawila, Bentara, and Beruwala for several years. The Kalutara Crimes Division confiscated a lorry and other equipment. Meanwhile, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has expressed concern about the growing demand for illegal liquor, which he believes is a consequence of the increased prices of legal alcohol. However, this implication is troubling as it can have numerous negative consequences. “One of the primary concerns associated with illegal liquor is its potential impact on public health. Illegally produced alcohol often lacks quality control and may be made with unsafe ingredients or in unregulated conditions. Consuming such liquor can lead to severe health complications and even fatalities. This situation underscores the urgent need for strict regulations and effective law enforcement to prevent the production and sale of illegal liquor,” he said Furthermore, Siyambalapitiya highlighted the loss of government revenue caused by the shift in consumer preference towards illegal liquor. When consumers turn to illegal sources, the government misses out on potential tax revenue that could have been collected from legal alcohol sales. This loss of revenue can have a negative impact on public finances, affecting various sectors and public services that rely on government funding, he pointed out. BY Dinithi Wijesundara"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/07/01/recognise-plantation-community-as-separate-ethnic-group/,Recognise plantation community as separate ethnic group,Author not found,0,2023-06-30T20:30:00+00:00," Catholic Bishops of the Plantation Region called for the recognition of the plantation community, which comprises a majority of ‘Indian Tamils’, as indicated by the Census Department, as a separate ethnic group in Sri Lanka. The Catholic Bishops of the Plantation Region (CBPR), in view of the 200th commemoration of the arrival of the Indian Origin Tamil population of the Plantation Community in Sri Lanka on Friday (30 June) observed that those recognised as ‘Indian Tamils’ by the Department of Census and Statistics and as the ‘Estate Sector’ by the Central Bank (CBSL) are of one and the same community that had a separate identity, tradition, jargon of language, art culture and literature. “Therefore, this community has all reasons to be recognised and treated as a separate ethnic group in Sri Lanka,” Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith said.     Submitting several recommendations to their unresolved socio- economic issues for the last 200 years, Cardinal Ranjith noted that it had been the result of the non-stable policy and plan of implementation by successive governments and managements of the plantations. He called for the inclusion of this “most vulnerable community into the National Social Services to accompany them towards a meaningful citizenship in Sri Lanka.” In an outline given by the CBPR it said that there were shortcomings in access to Primary Health Care. “The Primary Health Care System is not under the National Health Stream. Instead, it has around 500 Estate Medical Centres that are separately managed by a Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT) of the Regional Plantation Companies (RPC).” The CBPR said that though the plantation community lived on a mountainous region with an abundance of water resources, they were still deprived of safe drinking water due to lack of a proper mechanism and implementation of drinking water facilities on the estates. The Community is left with water from available streams that were below the expected standard of hygienic conditions. The Bishops recommended the Development in the field of housing and land rights as the plantation community mostly lived in dwelling known as ‘line rooms’ from the time of their arrival in Sri Lanka 20 Decades ago. “They do not enjoy the right to own a piece of land and build their own houses,” they observed.  The government of Sri Lanka needs to introduce new policies and bring legal arrangement by, to provide them with sufficient land and decent housing to enable them to live a dignified life. They urged the Government to have a political will and a national policy to address this issue. The CBPR noted that since landing on the island 20 decades ago, the children of the plantation community were deprived of education and were expected to work along with their parents and elders for more than 125 long years. “Even with the introduction of the Free Education in 1943, the so called ‘Estate schools’ were not incorporated into the National Educational System (NSE) until they were fully absorbed into the NSE  only in the latter part of 1970s. Therefore, the Plantation Children continue to lag behind in par with children of other communities who enjoyed the free education facilities since its inception in 943, the Bishops added.

Yesterday (23) several large rigifoam blocks were observed floating in various areas on the sea in Chilaw. Fishermen reported bringing these blocks back to the shore. Anton Roshantha, Chairman of the Chilaw Beach Fisheries Society, stated that in addition to the incident involving the X-Press Pearl vessel, there has been a significant accumulation of small plastic balls. Furthermore, Anton Roshantha mentioned that fishing nets have been soaked with a chemical solution, causing them to become heavier. As a result, fishing activity has decreased significantly in recent days. Most fishermen in Chilaw refrained from taking their boats out to sea on Friday (23) due to waste items, instead of fish, getting trapped in their nets. In addition, there have been reports of small plastic balls accumulating in the Mahawewa, Thoduwawa and Barudalpola. When inquired about this matter, Puttalam District Media Spokesperson of the National Fisheries Corporation, Loyel Pieris, revealed that a turtle had died in the early hours of Friday (23).

Addressing the parallel sessions at the Sri Lanka Health and Aging Study on the ‘Prevalence of diabetes and Pre-diabetes in Sri Lanka: a new global hotspot estimates from the Sri Lanka Health Ageing Survey 2018/2019’ on Friday (23), Dr. Rannan-Eliya said, most of the increases in diabetes and pre-diabetes prevalence with Body Mass Index (BMI) occurred in Sri Lankan adults of “normal weight”, as classified, using the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Asian BMI cut offs. He observed that previous studies suggested that diabetes prevalence in Sri Lanka was the highest in South Asia. It is associated with increased living standards, urban residence and higher BMI. But, “no internationally comparable estimates from any robust national survey covering all adults have been published,” he said. Dr. Rannan-Eliya noted that while Sri Lanka’s access to treatment was relatively high, there were shortcomings in controlling the non-communicable diseases (NCDs).” This was applicable to hypertension as well, he said. “Our findings suggest that the Asian BMI cut offs are not adequate to capture the increased risk of diabetes in Sri Lankans and probably in other South Asians and underlines the increased risk of diabetes in these populations at low body weights,” he noted.  The Executive Director of IHP said, the findings only reinforced the need for increased research to understand the drivers of increased risk of the disease in the South Asian populations and for increased efforts to tackle diabetes and underlying drivers such as weight gain in Sri Lanka.

This was revealed when COPA met last week to examine the Auditor General’s reports on the Ministry of Education in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Many of these tab computers have not been given to the students and teachers until the warranty had expired. Also, the tabs that have been distributed are inactive at the moment. On top of that, the distribution has not been done in a fair manner as well. Following these revelations, COPA instructed the Education Ministry to submit a report with regard to the matter before 26 September this year. The Education Ministry, which was under the purview of Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam in 2019, launched the project to provide tabs to students as a pilot project. It was reported that there was a purchase of 27,000 tabs and they were planned to be distributed to 1,000 schools which had computer labs and IT facilities to improve their facilities. Some of the teachers and Teacher Training Centres were to be provided with the tabs. Moreover, in another shocking revelation, the COPA said, the National Education Management Information System (NEMIS) for which Rs 64 million was used, does not contain enough data. In response the ministry officials said, the database contains information on teachers and the information on students is contained in another database. They also said there is a weakness with regard to the upgrading of the system. According to the Education Ministry’s website the NEMIS is an online web portal that automates the entire end-to-end management of education data and related administration functions. “The primary aim of the NEMIS is to collect, provide and analyse real-time data for better decision-making. Furthermore, NEMIS automates the manual processes of administration functions which decrease the waste of time and resources. NEMIS consists of modules which handle basically all the entities related to education including students, teachers, principals, schools, educational offices at zonal and provincial levels and the Ministry of Education.

Consequently, passengers who had made bookings had to be accommodated in nearby hotels, incurring potential costs amounting to millions of rupees. Speaking further, Jayasekara accused Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva of attempting to divert attention from the true problem plaguing SriLankan Airlines. “The Minister is trying to suppress the real issue at SriLankan Airlines and create a situation that would facilitate the airline’s sale. The pilots were demanding payment for their work during the Covid-19 period. Despite the grounding of flights, nearly 50 per cent of the pilots continued working,” he alleged. The MP also expressed concern over the significant inconvenience faced by passengers, as their vehicles are not allowed to enter the airport premises. As a result, passengers have to transport their luggage along the road to the passenger lounge.

Notably, in 2014, China sent its submarine, followed by two submarines from Russia last year. Sri Lanka, due to its strategic location on the East-West Maritime corridor and China’s dominance in the Indian Ocean has seen increasing number of warships calling at the port.

The main reason for this setback is that production and sale of alcohol has decreased due to the increase in the price of alcohol. As a result, reaching the targeted revenue for this year would be impossible, the officials representing the Department of Excise said. Committee Chair Mahindananda Aluthgamage, however said, the revenue of the Excise Department has not increased for a considerable number of years. “Because of this, it is not observed that the income has decreased, only due to the increase in the price of alcohol. Therefore, it is suggested to collect taxes directly from the large-scale alcohol production companies in the country. The licences of the manufacturing companies that fail to pay taxes would be revoked,” Aluthgamage stressed. Aluthgamage pointed out the need for digitisation of the Sri Lanka Excise Department. He pointed out that this institution has a history of 110 years and the lack of digitisation is a weakness. The Committee also instructed to prepare a system to check whether stickers are affixed to each liquor bottle in the liquor factories. It was mentioned that there is a trend of liquor bottles being released to the market without stickers. Due to this, the Committee instructed officials to prepare a proper mechanism to check this. The Chair also instructed to take necessary steps in order to cancel the liquor licence of the liquor shops selling alcohol without the sticker. The Chair also advised to check the quantity of liquor supplied to the liquor factories and the quantity of bottles distributed from the factories and take necessary measures if any irregularities occur. Aluthgamage further instructed that the officials attached to the Excise Department, who are working in the liquor factories, have been working in those companies for a long time, thus it is observed that corruption and irregularities are taking place and therefore to prepare a system to change these officials periodically. Furthermore, Aluthgamage instructed to inform the Committee of the laws and regulations, which are necessary to increase the efficiency of the Excise Department. Aluthgamage instructed to submit a report to the committee within two weeks showing the necessary plans to increase the income of the Sri Lanka Excise Department in relation to these matters."

He made this request at the Parliamentary Caucus for Children. In his address, he stated, “I am someone who supports media freedom, but I urge the media to handle cases, involving children with sensitivity. We must consider that these children have their whole lives ahead of them. The only way to stop this unethical behavior is for at least one affected victim to come forward and file a case.” Following his statement, Sanjeewani Abeykoon, the Law Enforcement Director of the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), highlighted the law and punishment pertaining to the crime of revealing the personal identity of a sexually abused victim and offenders could face up to two years of imprisonment. Abeykoon said, “The public is unaware of Section 365-C of the Penal Code, as amended in 1995, which deems the disclosure of a sexually assaulted victim’s personal identity as a crime. The NCPA is prepared to support the victims, but their silence is often due to a lack of knowledge about this law. Since 1995, no cases have been filed under this law. We hope that the victims will now step forward and take legal action.” GIG Renuka Jayasundara, the Chief of Police in charge of the Child and Women Abuse Prevention Division, revealed that thousands of complaints with regard to sexual assaults are reported each month. She further explained, “The Police do not have facilities to keep victimised children in custody after their medical examination, especially in cases of physical or sexual abuse. We cannot retain custody of the child or send them back home if the suspect is a family member, which is the majority of reported cases.” Responding to DIG Jayasundara, MP Weerasumana Weerasinghe emphasised the need for funding and support for Child Development Centres and children’s homes. He suggested that these facilities should be made suitable for children’s growth. Alternatively, he proposed that Child Development Centres, which currently rely on NGO funding, should be placed under government custody for the betterment and safety of the children.

Sinhapura Chethiyalankara Thera, said several places of archaeological value, in the historic Dimbulagala Aranya Senasanaya, have been burned, extensively excavated, and damaged by an organised group of treasure hunters over the past few days. According to Ven. Thera, these treasure thieves, who were living and eating in these places by setting up tents, have damaged many locations containing valuable archaeological artefacts. They drilled the stones, dug large pits, and set fire to these places. The medicine pond, Kosgaha Ulpotha, is among the areas affected. Ven. Thera mentioned that these organised treasure hunters have been hiding on the hilltop of the historical Dimbulagala Aranya Senasanaya since the Poson period. They have been excavating these significant archaeological sites day and night, resulting in serious damage to the sites. On Thursday (22) evening, officers from the Aralagangwila STF camp and some monks working in the temple observed the area damaged by these treasure hunters. The Chief Incumbent also mentioned that they discovered many tents and utensils used by the treasure hunters. He appealed to all relevant authorities to establish a programme for the preservation of this historic Aranya Senasanaya, which is a unique landmark of the Kingdoms of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, as well as all the places of historical archaeological value, located at the peak of the hill, before they are destroyed by these treasure hunters. The Chief Incumbent requested the relevant authorities and the Minister of Archaeology to promptly develop a programme for the protection of this historical Aranya Senasanaya and the surrounding areas of archaeological importance. The prelates also emphasised that these organised treasure hunters are engaged in a meat racket by hunting deer and elk on the top of Dimbulagala hill, taking advantage of the prevailing dry weather.

He said, as per the IMF Agreement that was tabled in Parliament, the Government is expecting to pay foreign loans amounting to USD 25 billion during the next five-years. But, he mentioned that the truth of the matter, as per calculations done by the Government, is the amount of foreign debt that has to be paid stands at USD 28 billion. Hence, he charged that in order to secure an additional USD 3 billion the Government will be forced to restructure domestic debt with no other alternative being at hand. BY Anuradha Herath"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/17/vital-records-at-national-archives-under-threat/,Vital Records at National Archives Under Threat,Author not found,0,2023-06-16T20:35:00+00:00," The Sri Lanka National Archives (SLNA), responsible for safeguarding vital records and preserving the national identity, accountability, and memory, is facing a critical situation due to stalled renovations in its main building for over two years, Ceylon Today reliably learns. According to concerned senior officials, presently, the building lacks essential features such as an air cooling system and fire protection, necessary for preserving archives. As a result, the archives have been relocated to other departments, creating challenges for the staff who struggle to cope with the limited space available. This has put the invaluable archives at risk and hindered the training and outreach programmes offered by SLNA. The gravity of the situation is worsened by the shortage of staff. The main building, constructed with a unique architectural design, is now over 45 years old. Several years ago, significant portions of the structure began to deteriorate and collapse, causing distress among staff and visitors to the National Archives. Following a request by the Department of National Archives, a Cabinet Memorandum (No. 17/29/2988/742/050, dated 17 January 2018) approved the removal and repair of dilapidated concrete fins, as well as the installation of central air cooling, fire protection, and advanced security systems. However, due to various internal reasons, renovation did not commence until January 2019. Since then, the renovation project has come to a standstill due to lack of funds. Most parts of the main building remain closed, forcing the staff to work in alternative locations, facing numerous hardships. The primary concern is the difficulty in preserving the archives. SLNA houses centuries-old records that require controlled environmental conditions to prevent their destruction. This challenge is exacerbated by Sri Lanka’s tropical climate. The renovated main building would address this need, but unfortunately, the delay in construction has put the archives at risk, as officials have expressed. Despite the challenges, SLNA staff strives to adhere to best practices in archive preservation, using acid-free boxes and repositories with controlled environments. However, due to inadequate infrastructure, a large number of archives are stored in temporary locations. Further, the abrupt halt in renovation has resulted in the discontinuation of courses, training programmes, and public functions since 2019. These include courses on bookbinding, training programmes on record management, and training for executive-level officials. Additionally, the SLNA is presently unable to host public functions due to safety and health concerns, as there is insufficient space available due to ongoing renovation. Moreover, the department is grappling with a severe shortage of staff. Out of an allocated cadre of 286, only 135 positions are filled, resulting in a significant shortfall of 40 per cent. Consequently, the existing staff is burdened with increased responsibilities. Under such circumstances, the Department of National Archives cannot allocate staff for training and outreach programmes. The shortage of staff is particularly felt in the conservation unit, which plays a vital role in preserving and prolonging the lifespan of damaged and vulnerable archives using specialised techniques and chemicals. However, the conservation unit presently comprises only three conservators, far below the standard cadre of 27. According to reliable sources, the SLNA has requested special permission from Cabinet to recruit staff for essential positions. However, due to the ongoing economic crisis, the Government has halted recruitment. Meanwhile, Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Vidura Wickremanayake has pledged to advocate for increased budgetary allocations for the Department of National Archives in the upcoming year.

The committee recently convened under the chairmanship of MP Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara. In response to these concerns, the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the ministry has consistently conveyed Sri Lanka’s position on this matter to the respective governments of the countries involved both through ambassadors and during high-level discussions. Additionally, they have requested these governments to reconsider their decisions. The committee has instructed the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to compile all pertinent information and communicate it to the respective ambassadors, to challenge the travel ban imposed on Sri Lankan military personnel. The committee also emphasised the need to publicise our strong opposition to the ban, citing its violation of the Geneva Convention. This violation is supported by reports from both the Darusman and OICL reports, which confirm that Sri Lanka had a non-international armed conflict. Weerasekara highlighted that the Canadian Parliament passed a motion unanimously stating that Sri Lanka had committed genocide against the Tamil people. Consequently, the committee has urged the Secretary of Foreign Affairs to take appropriate action and effectively communicate to other countries that Sri Lanka is not accountable for such allegations. Additionally, the committee raised concerns about the ongoing downsizing of the Sri Lanka Army and the withdrawal of Army camps in specific rural sacred areas, and its potential impact on national security. The Secretary to the Ministry of Defence reassured the committee that the withdrawal of the Army does not compromise national security, regional security, or the security of sacred places. The Ministry of Defence practises “rightsizing” rather than downsizing, and the rightsizing of the Sri Lanka Army has no adverse effects, according to the Secretary. Further, the committee acknowledged the importance of fostering harmony among ethnic groups and directed relevant officials to take appropriate action in this regard."

The project, which commenced in January 2016, was originally scheduled for completion in 2020. However, due to challenges faced by the contractor company, issues related to compensating residents for relocation, complications arising from water pipes along the road, and various other general problems, the project experienced significant delays.

President of the All Island Private Pharmacy Owners’ Association (AIPPOA), Chandika Gankanda said on Friday (16) said that with new price revisions introduced to 60 medicinal drugs, pharmacy owners had urged the PCSL to give them a note of credit to cover the losses they would incur when retailing medicines. However, the Chamber has continued to refuse the AIPPOA which would lead to the Association taking matters into its own hands by 27 June and paying lesser amounts for the bills that they receive from pharmaceutical companies. The gazetted price revisions with a 16 per cent reduction in prices of 60 types of medicinal drugs coming into effect from 26 June may result in more drug shortages in private pharmacies. Private pharmacy owners throughout the country have expressed concern with regard to the losses they would incur when the gazetted price revisions came into effect. Those medicines were purchased bearing heavy costs from the companies to be retailed at their old prices. “We will be unable to retail all those drugs by 26 June,” Gankanda said, noting that medicines cannot be sold like rice and coconuts. The Union has requested the PCSL to provide a note of credit, so that all private pharmacies would be able to meet their losses. After all when the cost of medicines was increased by the Government pharmaceutical companies even withdrew drug stocks that had been sent to the distributors to stamp the new cost of the drugs on their labels. The AIPPOA has decided that should the Chamber continue to steadfastly refuse the provision of note of credit the private pharmacy owners themselves would reduce from the drug bills they received from pharmaceutical companies. The Association said it had met the Health Minister as well to discuss their dilemma.  However, the AIPPOA continued to pressure the Health Ministry to reduce prices of pharmaceuticals. But prices of only 45 per cent of the medicinal drugs have been reduced whereas there were 55 per cent more which needed a price ceiling. The Health Ministry, issuing a new Gazette, revised the maximum retail price of 60 types of medicines, which include Albendazole (used to treat infections caused by worms), Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid (used to treat infections caused by bacteria), Clarithromycin, Cephalexin (used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria), Aspirin, Metformin, Thyroxin, Diclofenac Sodium and several other medicines. According to the Gazette issued on Thursday (15), the prices of the medicines have been reduced by 16 per cent with effect from 26 June. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

In an interview with Ceylon Today Thondaman said, “It is evident that fair trade organisations worldwide are not conducting thorough investigations and we believe they should refer to the reports of United Nations Special Rapporteurs to understand that the RPCs are deceiving workers in Sri Lanka. Our goal is to expose the companies that exploit workers and make the world aware of their deceptive practices.” He claimed that in an estate in Kegalle, workers traditionally engage in the outgrow system and have access to VP bushes spanning two to three acres. However, the company removed all the bushes from them and made them work on the seedling bushes, exploiting the workers. “We strongly oppose such practices and plan to raise this issue at international forums, including going to Geneva in October this year, with the support of the media.” Thondaman also pointed out another major plantation company that claims on their website to be a member of the United Nations Global Compact Network. However, when checking the UN page, that company is not listed there, and it is clear that they have falsified the information about constructing houses for 64 per cent of their workers. When confronted, the company admitted to this deception. “One of the reasons why we consider the out-growing system unfair is the lack of regulation. For instance, if the sale price of tea is Rs 130 per kg, workers are paid Rs 40, which is an unfair ratio. Today, tea prices have risen to more than Rs 200, yet workers only receive Rs 50. Is that fair? If it were a revenue-sharing model, the distribution should be equal. However, the companies take advantage of these workers. Additionally, they draft agreements between workers and managers in Sinhala, a language I, as a Minister, cannot read or write. How can they expect a worker to understand and comply with a document they cannot read? I refuse to sign any document that I don’t comprehend,” Thondaman stated. He added that in the past, there were planters who took care of the estates, but now they have accountants who manipulate the figures to show losses when they are actually making revenue. They lack the knowledge of how to treat workers and properly manage replanting. Thondaman also shared the story of a family where the woman works in Dubai and had sent money to build a toilet. However, when they built the toilet with their own funds in their line room, the estate manager called the Police and had it demolished, claiming that the land belongs to the company. He emphasised the distressing mistreatment of a family that has lived there for 200 years by a manager who arrived only four years ago. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Speaking to the media in Ruwanwella, the State Minister emphasised the need to thoroughly study the current situation in the country before taking any decisions regarding vehicle imports. He highlighted the impact of allocating USD 80 million for fuel purchase, which has affected the value of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar. Therefore, decisions involving large amounts of foreign reserves, such as vehicle imports, should be take after careful analysis. Regarding the recent depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar, the Minister explained that it occurred because the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation had to purchase approximately USD 75 to 80 million from the Central Bank to buy fuel. He further clarified that parties investing in dollars anticipated the rise of the dollar, leading to the current situation. Siyambalapitiya emphasised that this is a normal occurrence. Sri Lanka Customs recently informed the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Economic and Physical Plans that due to the ban on vehicle imports, Customs is facing challenges in achieving its revenue targets for 2023. In response, the committee’s Chairman, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, said the Government is currently engaged in discussions regarding the vehicle import ban.

These agencies urge the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to establish a new Traffic Separation Scheme that passes through Hambantota Port. The proposal will be discussed during the week commencing 3 July at the IMO, according to Jakob P. Larsen, Head of Maritime Safety and Security at BIMCO, Ceylon Today learns. BIMCO collaborated with the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), Independent Tanker Owners’ Association (INTERTANKO), Cruise Lines’ International Association (CLIA), to appeal to the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the IMO of the pressing need to establish a new Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) south of Sri Lanka to protect marine species, specifically the endangered blue whale. Larsen expressed in an email that they strongly encourage Sri Lankan maritime authorities to act now and this is not the first time the topic is brought up with the Sri Lankan authorities. Sri Lanka has not heeded the matter on the belief of unforeseen factors that could disrupt the East-West corridor, where Sri Lanka is strategically located anticipating to reap benefits from a potential maritime trade boost for Sri Lanka. The problems and risks associated with the current TSS south of Dondra Head have been the subject of discussions with Sri Lanka over the last decade and the first discussion had been held in September 2011 between IMO and the IWC that briefed concerning blue whales and ship strikes in the TSS and the last conversation was held regarding the matter in March 2022 where the WSC wrote to the President of Sri Lanka at that time and other senior Sri Lankan officials emphasising the value of creating a new TSS and inviting Sri Lanka to discuss the matter. Larsen said such rerouting would greatly benefit the marine life of Sri Lanka and enhance the country’s tourism industry. “To establish a new traffic separation system 15 nautical miles further south of the one presently used is a win-win for all stakeholders,” Larsen said, pointing at the benefits. “It will improve conditions for marine life in the area. There will be fewer collisions between whales and ships. It will improve safety for the many Sri Lankan fishermen working in the rich fishing grounds south of Dondra Head. It will improve the foundation for the tourism and whale-watching industry and potentially strengthen the economy. It will improve the safety of ships typically in transit from Far East to Middle East, Africa, and beyond,” he added. Through the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) located south of Dondra Head, Sri Lanka serves one of the largest marine trade lanes in the world. This trade corridor serves thousands of ships engaged in trade between Asia and Europe as well as important trade bound for destinations in the Indian Ocean and other locations connected to this major East-West marine traffic corridor. Data indicates that over 40,000 ships transit through these waters every year. The issue has also been the subject of several research studies conducted by scientists in Sri Lanka in collaboration with international experts. Some of these studies assess the risk of ship strikes within the existing TSS and also for alternative routes further offshore. For example, Priyadarshana et al. (2016) estimate a 95 per cent reduction in risk if shipping is routed 15 nm further south. The risks described above have resulted in a very large number of ships choosing to sail south of the existing TSS. Numerous masters and carriers have elected to sail south in light of the congestion, risk of accidents and well-known risk of ship strikes in the existing TSS. Data shows 33 per cent of ships transiting this area are now choosing to sail south to avoid the risks incumbent with the use of the existing TSS south of Dondra Head. The number and percentage of ships sailing south is growing significantly (from around 20 per cent in 2013) as a number of the world’s largest carriers and individual masters are choosing to sail roughly 15 nm south of the existing TSS due to the aforementioned risks.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/10/privatisation-of-slt-a-threat-to-national-security-soc/,Privatisation of SLT a threat to national security – SOC,Author not found,0,2023-06-09T20:33:00+00:00," The Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on National Security has issued a recommendation against the privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) due to potential threats to national security. The report of the committee, headed by Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara, was presented to Parliament on Friday (9). However, Ceylon Today learns that this report would be highly unlikely to affect the Government’s original decision to privatise several key institutions including the SLT. Following the committee report, the President’s Media Division (PMD) in a statement said, the Government has reassured that the policy decision taken will not compromise national security, contrary to what is indicated in the report. “The Government will take a final decision during an upcoming Cabinet meeting, considering this report along with recommendations from the information and communication sector. Additionally, the President emphasises that the current Government’s policy is focused on providing opportunities to the private sector, distancing it from direct Government involvement,” the PMD said. The committee report titled ‘The effects of the privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom on National Security,’ said SLT is already partially privatised, with international companies holding 44.98% of the stake and the Government holding 49.5%. Further privatisation could result in the exposure of the country’s critical communication infrastructure and sensitive information to private entities driven by profit-oriented interests, thereby compromising national security, the report claimed. The report also emphasised that individuals or organisations that have been blacklisted or have aided terrorists or extremists in any form should not be allowed to purchase shares or have any control over national assets. To address the issue, the Committee proposed that the State exercise its right to repurchase the shares held by the other major shareholder of SLT, as stipulated in the agreement. The segments of SLT would then be divided into categories such as sensitive and vulnerable, excess lands and buildings, critical infrastructure, and the business itself. Furthermore, the Committee recommended that while retaining ownership of the segments that directly impact national security, the State can divest the remaining portions through a Public-Private Partnership model. This approach would ensure the protection of critical infrastructure and adherence to Government regulations. By doing so, the Government would be able to exit from direct involvement in business operations, while still generating profit and safeguarding national security, the report added. The PMD in its statement said, the Government has focussed its attention to the committee report, which was presented to Parliament emphasising the concerns surrounding the potential risk to national security resulting from the privatisation of SLT. “While acknowledging the factual content of the report, the Government believes that it lacks a logical or scientific data analysis pertaining to the subject matter. To address this deficiency, it is necessary to examine the operation and regulation of information and communication technology service providers in Sri Lanka, analyse financial data related to the sector, understand Sri Lanka’s national ambitions in this field, assess the available capital capacity and conduct a comprehensive study of global trends,” the statement said.

The state-of-the-art high-tech analyser uses an analytic technique to measure and identify elements. The AHP President lamented that two more ICPMS machines, which were currently in working condition had been set up at the National Hospital and Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, but they had not been used to conduct  even 10 to 12 tests for the whole of last year. Some of these machines were purchased in 2018, while there were those which had been purchased after 2020 and remained unused since they were set up at the relevant hospital. He alleged that these pieces of medical technology were purchased on the requests of relevant consultants, but were abandoned as soon as that particular consultant left that hospital.

He only thinks about constitutional amendments. It is imperative that the ethnic question be resolved as soon as possible. We have already held many rounds of negotiations with the Government, but nothing has happened.” Sampanthan alleged the Government is postponing the solution to the ethnic problem as well as the holding of elections. If this situation continues, it will not be possible to work together with President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The ethnic problem should be resolved within the next few months. If the Government fails to provide such a solution, steps will be taken to get a solution under the international law,” he asserted. According to Sampanthan, the President said, the Government is working to establish interim administrative councils in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. “The Illankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) members questioned whether separate administrative councils would be established in the two provinces or whether one administrative council would be formed by combining them. However, the President did not give a direct answer to that question. He said, he also has such an idea and will discuss it with other political parties and take a decision,” he said.

The BASL statement reads: “We believe that the right to protest, as manifested in the freedom of assembly, association and expression, is an important feature of a democratic society. This right is vital for the healthy functioning of a democracy and while it is recognised that the right to protest can be subjected to certain limitations, it is equally important to ensure that these limitations are not the results of arbitrary measures contrary to the rule of law, and the equal protection of the law as guaranteed by Article 12 of the Constitution. “In the recent case of U. N. S. P. Kurukulasuriya, Convenor, Free Media Movement and J. K. W. Jayasekara, Vs Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation, SCFR 556/2008 and 557/2008, decided on 17.02.2021, the Supreme Court quoted with approval the following passages found in several decisions of Sri Lankan Courts: “The right to support or to criticise governments and political parties, policies and programmes is fundamental to the democratic way of life; …and democracy requires not merely that dissent be tolerated, but that it be encouraged. “Criticism of the Government, and of political parties and policies, is per se, a permissible exercise of the freedom of speech and expression under Article14 (1) (a).” In the same case, His Lordship Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare observed as follows: “The danger of suppressing dissent was emphasised in Gunawardena vs Pathirana, OIC, Police Station, Elpitiya (1997) 1 Sri LR 265, stating that dissent, or disagreement manifested by conduct or action, is a cornerstone of the Constitution, which should not only be tolerated but encouraged by the Executive as obligated expressly by Article 4(d), Justice Mark Fernando cited the dictum of Justice Jackson in West Virginia State Board of Education vs Barbette (1943) 319 US 624, 641; “Those who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves exterminating dissenters. Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard. It seems trite but necessary to say that the First,” the statement said. “Amendment was designed to avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings.” Therefore, we would like to remind the government that in a country with a rich history of expression through protest, it is important that people are not silenced and their right to peaceful protest is upheld and respected.”"

The Committee was appointed on 24 November 2021.

CSR’s Executive Director Rev. Fr. Rohan Silva said, given the seriousness of the Committee’s findings about Ratwatte’s behaviour, as well as its conclusion that Ratwatte purported to represent the State at the prisons and his behaviour resulted in bringing the government to disrepute. CSR is also concerned that no action has been taken against any prison official for failure to perform their duty of care and protection of prisoners and the two civilians who went with Lohan Ratwatte to watch the gallows in Welikada prison as well as security officials who accompanied Ratwatte, without attempting to stop him from engaging in illegal acts, the priest said. He said, the CSR agrees with the committee’s observation that the report is based only on information that “passes the tests of consistency, probability, and spontaneity,” permitting the Committee to conclude that the “information is truthful and trustworthy, and not mere fiction”."

Speaking to Ceylon Today, she said the Bill would enable microfinance institutions and money lending institutions and individuals in Sri Lanka to be subject to mandatory regulation and supervision.She said, the proposed bill is currently in the final stages of drafting and is expected to be presented to Parliament soon. She said, through the proposed legislation, banks and other financial institutions licensed by the CBSL will be subject to continuous surveillance and on-site inspections. Directives have been put in place for the protection of consumers of finance businesses and banks and if a violation of those directives is detected during the above investigations, regulatory action can be taken, she pointed out. “In particular, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka will check whether licensed finance institutions conduct a proper credit evaluation and a proper study of the customer’s indebtedness while providing microfinance loans.” She affirmed that there are a number of different institutions operating in the microfinance sector in Sri Lanka, but according to the existing legal framework, it is not mandatory to obtain a licence to engage in a business that lends money without taking deposits from the public. Accordingly, institutions that provide microfinance loans that are not subject to such regulation and supervision are currently operating in the microfinance sector, she opined. She mentioned that due to the regulation and supervision of money lending institutions and individuals, the microfinance sector has faced problems due to consumer distress, charging high loan interest and lack of proper loan information.She emphasised that due to the consumer’s taking loans from many sources and using the loans for consumption instead of proper income-generating entrepreneurship, they become highly indebted. She stressed that the Financial Customer Relations Department is located for the customers of the financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the microfinance customers of those institutions can make their complaints there. She added that the relevant complaints can be made with the Financial Customer Relations Department at 30, Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo 1 by post, dialling 0112477966 or through the e-mail address [email protected].

This decision has been made possible due to the improved supply of US dollars, leading to a relaxation of the previously imposed constraints. In response to the foreign exchange crisis last year, the Government implemented a ban on the importation of 1,465 items. However, considering the evolving economic situation, certain restrictions have been gradually lifted on select products. Siyambalapitiya addressed the media in Ruwanwella, emphasising that the initial import restrictions were implemented last year due to a shortage of foreign exchange in April. He further explained, the significant depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee, nearly 100 per cent, further necessitated these measures. During this challenging period, the Government chose to restrict the importation of non-essential items, he said. “However, the Government remains dedicated to safeguarding and promoting local industries. As a result, import restrictions on goods that are produced domestically will not be lifted at this time,” he said."

He said efforts are being made to launch the Climate Change University, next year. Additionally, the University Grants Commission has recently identified approximately 130 scientists, who have gained international recognition for their research on climate change. These scientists are expected to be brought together, along with their respective international affiliations, as part of this initiative, the PMD said. This was revealed, at the briefing on the progress of Climate Change and Green Growth, held recently at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, between President Wickremesinghe and officials of the Climate Change Secretariat, led by President’s Adviser on Climate Change Ruwan Wijewardene. The discussions also revolved around inviting a group of international experts from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, tentatively scheduled for July/August. The purpose of their visit would be to engage in policy conversations, addressing global issues, and exploring potential research projects that could be derived from these policy dialogues. Furthermore, it was disclosed that negotiations between Sri Lanka and the Korea Exim Bank, led by the External Resource Department, concluded successfully. President Wickremesinghe expressed his perspective on the International Climate Change University, emphasising that it is a post-graduate institution solely focused on research and does not offer undergraduate courses. Any country or organisation that contributes to the university becomes a stakeholder and gains membership on the Board of Governance. The Korean Exim Bank has expressed interest in partnering with the university. President Wickremesinghe urged that all future research in the field of climate change should be conducted at this institution. President Wickremesinghe stated that prestigious institutions like Harvard and MIT have expressed interest in collaboration. According to the PMD, the President also requested the consideration of short-term courses for government officials. During the briefing, the five thematic areas established during a previous meeting with President Wickremesinghe were extensively discussed. These areas include the Climate Change Office, Green Finance Facilitation, International Climate Change University, Nature Positive Green Growth, and Innovative Management Support. Specific attention was given to regions lagging behind in these areas, such as marine pollution and electric car mobility, the PMD added. President Wickremesinghe instructed the authorities to address these concerns, involve the private sector and international organisations in the efforts. Using the X-Press Pearl incident as an example, it was recommended that the Central Environment Authority, Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), and Department of Coast Conservation be merged into a single authority. This consolidation would enable more effective handling of matters related to environmental issues, as the Central Environmental Authority was not involved in or aware of the MV X-Press Pearl incident due to the fragmented authority structure. During the discussions, aimed at establishing Sri Lanka as a shipping hub in the region, various concerns were raised regarding the lack of a disaster-prevention authority. These concerns were highlighted in the concept paper, along with the willingness of international supporters to provide assistance. The President emphasised the importance of focusing on disaster preparedness within the country rather than solely relying on assistance from India. Attention was also given to the catastrophe management programme of the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), with a European delegation expressing their desire to assist. “This European team is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka on 12 June to guide the development of an internationally recognised regional disaster management programme. Another matter of concern was MEPA’s interest in establishing a separate disaster management unit within their organisation, supported by private sector funding.  Multiple offers of assistance from external sources were received, as there is significant interest in ocean-related matters that intersect with climate change. The United Nations (UN) agencies expressed interest in marine spatial planning and sought a focal point in Sri Lanka for potential assistance.  Additionally, there were discussions regarding an international maritime organisation initiative to relocate the marine traffic separation line near Hambantota further away to minimise the impact on whales in the area,” the PMD said. Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabri, Minister of Environment Naseer Ahamed, Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, President’s Senior Economic Adviser Dr. R.H. Samaratunga, Secretary of Foreign Affairs Aruni Wijewardane, Secretary to the Ministry of Environment Dr Anil Jasinghe, Director of Presidential International Affairs Dinouk Colombage, Dr. Ananda Mallawathantri and the other officials of the line Ministries attended the discussion."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/03/chec-port-city-tax-holidays-to-be-reduced-to-25-years-amunugama/,CHEC Port City tax holidays to be reduced to 25 years– Amunugama,Author not found,0,2023-06-02T20:32:00+00:00," Following concerns, raised by officials from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), over the huge 40-year tax concession for CHEC Port City Developers, State Minister of Investment Promotion, Dilum Amunugma, has confirmed that the CHEC developers have agreed to reduce the tax concession from 50 to 25 years at the outset of Sri Lanka seeking a USD 2.9 billion bailout package to address the country’s debt overhang. According the Investment Promotion Ministry the 40-year tax holiday was reduced to 25 years and after 25 years, it would be 50 per cent of the tax for 10 years. State Minister Amunugma told Ceylon Today, during an interview, that the CHEC Port City Developers have agreed to reduce the tax concession from the 40 to 25 years awarded to them.  The IMF Directors called for a prudent management of the Colombo Port City Project in the staff report of the year 2021.   The IMF had underlined the importance of Sri Lanka reducing the massive tax holidays offered to investors in the CHEC Port City Colombo. The Colombo Port City Project brings about an important opportunity for investment promotion and for testing growth-enhancing structural reforms. To maximise its benefits while minimising associated risks, there is a need to ring-fence tax concessions, ensure compliance with international tax and AML/CFT standards, and shield the domestic financial sector from offshore banking activities in the Port City, the IMF Staff report had said. The IMF is concerned about huge tax concession given to investors of the Port City and CHEC Port City Commission is trying to narrow down the tax holidays to 25 years for the Chinese blocks in the Port City, noted the State Minister. He said, he and his Ministry officials had met the Deputy Managing Director of IMF at the Port City and his question was also why to such huge tax concession. The Minister underscored that the Sri Lankan Government has not spent a penny on the development of the Port City and that is their bill or charges for creating a Port City that is 2.5 square km out of the sea. ‘We are discussing and the CHEC Port City is considering the reduction of tax holidays to 25 years. The Chinese have agreed, said the State Minister.  Even the Port City land that belongs to State will have reduce tax holidays based on the Business of Strategic Importance (BSI) regulations that is now being drafted. The tax concession was given to the Chinese contractor CHEC.  “China has been nice enough to cooperate.  With the IMF discussions and when be brought in the BSI in writing, but technically we have negotiated to 25 years tax concession. The State Investment Promotion Minister who anticipates potential investment outlook for Sri Lanka in the Year 2024 said the crisis itself has come as a blessing for investment in one way where investor will come when the country is hit by financial crisis where the investor can make money and help boost investment to the host country as well.  He said, Sri Lanka’s competitors are Vietnam and Bangladesh whereas India is going free on offering lands for investors. This is why we have to compete and we are in a provision to give concessions which is very challenging he added. The CHEC had discussions with the IMF officials at the Port City.  The IMF team met the CEO of Port City. If they did not agree with the BSI there would be a problem.  The IMF has agreed to the BSI which has the regulation of 25-year tax holidays. The State Minster said, the BSI will be regulatory body for the tax concession of the Port City and the new investment laws that are to be introduced by 2023 will be applied for new investors outside the Port City. “The BSI will set the concession for the Port City and the new investment law will say what the concession would be outside the Port City for the new packages.” Chinese delegation, led by Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, Sun Weidong, along with high-ranking officials from the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), engaged in the Port City’s investment construction project, were in Sri Lanka and Weidong conveyed his strong interest in exploring opportunities to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries, further underlining China’s dedication to fostering closer ties with Sri Lanka on multiple fronts. They also met with the Sri Lankan President. The Chinese delegation included officials such as Chen Zhong, Vice President of CCCC Group, Tang Qiaoliang, President of China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) Group Overseas Business and Chairman of CHEC, and Zhang Xiaoqiang, Vice President of CHEC and Director General of Sri Lanka Regional Company. They arrived in Sri Lanka and participated in the 12th round of Diplomatic Consultations in Colombo on 30 May 2023, between the two countries. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

As per the project conditions, there was a requirement for the Adani Group to fulfill a banking threshold in Sri Lanka, which they have done. However, since the PPA   has not been finalised, the project commencement has been delayed. The CEB is the buyer of the energy, hence they need to have the PPA ready and that will be finalised soon, he added. He said, there is no dispute and the CEB is drafting the agreement for all renewable energy projects in Sri Lanka and there is no other disputes regarding the Adani investment He also pointed out that there is USD 604 million in new investments for Sri Lanka, for the first quarter and the agreements have been signed. He noted that about 50 per cent are renewable energy projects. The investment fund has not arrived in full, however, around USD 250 million is in Sri Lanka.

He expressed concern over the way the country is currently being governed, comparing it to a flawed democracy. Rajakaruna, mentioning the former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, said, “There is freedom of speech and expression, but it cannot be guaranteed beyond that point. Idi Amin’s democracy is reflected in the introduction of a media regulation Act. This Act is highly dangerous as it allows the government to control what is being broadcast. It violates human rights and suppresses the freedom of expression of media organisations and individuals who share their opinions. It goes against the law and the Constitution.” He further said, this is why they are actively opposing the implementation of Idi Amin’s style of democracy and working against it. They have recently taken the matter to Court, hoping that justice will prevail. Rajakaruna alleged the entire country is currently being ruled by a dictator, evidenced by the absence of Provincial Council Elections. The Provincial Councils now comprise individuals, appointed by the President, who are loyal to him, effectively consolidating control in one person’s hands. Furthermore, he said Local Government bodies are also not functioning democratically. Even if the Court orders local government elections to be held, they are not implemented. Instead, those in power manipulate the law to exert control over LG bodies. Rajakaruna raised concerns about the appointment of friends and acquaintances to positions of authority, which is not provided for in the law. He mentioned an instance where a representative of the ruling party appointed a friend to a local council, resulting in the driver of the former chairman now being in control. The politicisation of these institutions and the disregard for democratic processes were distressing, he stressed and urged the people of the country to stand against this situation and take action.

During a discussion held on 25 May, President Wickremesinghe expressed his gratitude to Japan for their support during Sri Lanka’s economic crisis and debt restructuring talks. He informed the Japanese Prime Minister of the progress in the debt restructuring talks, including China’s involvement as an observer. President Wickremesinghe clarified that China’s role was limited to bilateral talks and that Sri Lanka was engaging with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well. He assured Japan that there was no preferential treatment for China and expressed the desire for China to become a full member of the creditor talks. President Wickremesinghe also apologised to Japan for any mistreatment experienced by the Japanese Government and people during the previous administration. He discussed plans for a new law governing mega projects in Sri Lanka, emphasising transparency and parliamentary oversight. The President expressed his intention to resume the halted Japanese projects, such as the Light Rail Transit (LRT) and the Central Expressway, subject to further discussions. He reiterated Sri Lanka’s support for Prime Minister Kishida’s ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific’ (FOIP) initiative and highlighted the alignment of Japan’s climate change targets with those of Sri Lanka. He expressed the intention to promote 2050 targets to address climate change. Prime Minister Kishida appreciated Sri Lanka’s support for the FOIP initiative and mentioned the ongoing dialogue between Japan and China to reduce tensions and strengthen the initiative. To enhance bilateral cooperation, Prime Minister Kishida proposed ministerial-level consultations between the two governments on various topics. He also expressed Japan’s willingness to continue the dialogue with Sri Lanka regarding its participation in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). During the meeting, the leaders discussed the situation in the South China Sea, with Prime Minister Kishida expressing Japan’s opposition to China’s unilateral attempts to reshape the region’s dynamics. They also emphasised the importance of nuclear disarmament, particularly in light of North Korea’s recent tests. Prime Minister Kishida requested Sri Lanka’s ratification of the UN Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, to which President Wickremesinghe agreed, confirming that the Foreign Ministry was in the process of doing so. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida informed President Ranil Wickremesinghe about the ongoing efforts to develop a code of conduct between China and ASEAN.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe also met Minister of Digital Transformation Taro Kono of Japan to discuss the ongoing digitisation efforts in Sri Lanka. They highlighted the progress made in the digitisation of the Sri Lankan economy, with a focus on private sector involvement. The importance of smooth transition and implementation, supported by necessary legislation, was emphasised. Minister Kono recommended the establishment of a single authority to oversee the digitisation process within the Sri Lankan Government system, drawing from Japan’s own experience. He also expressed support for Sri Lanka’s development of Financial Technology (FinTech) and offered assistance in this area. During his visit, President Wickremesinghe also held meetings with four former Japanese Prime Ministers: Yasuo Fukuda, Yoshihide Suga, Taro Aso, and Yukio Hatoyama. The former Prime Ministers emphasised the significance of building strong ties between the two nations, highlighting the historical connection and the mutual benefits of closer integration. Their endorsement showcased the potential for collaboration and cooperation. These former Japanese Prime Ministers continue to hold considerable influence within the Japanese Diet (Parliament), with three of them commanding the support of a large number of Japanese Members of Parliament. Their participation in the meetings emphasised the importance of their collective experience and expertise in shaping Japan’s political landscape. Expressing appreciation for President Wickremesinghe’s efforts to repair and strengthen the ties between Sri Lanka and Japan, the former Prime Ministers drew reference to former President J.R. Jayewardene. They highlighted his significant role in defending Japan during the San Francisco Peace Conference, which ultimately led to Japan’s readmission into the international community following World War II.

Launched on Tuesday (30 May), this operation was carried out based on specific input from DRI regarding the smuggling of contraband from the island nation to India. In anticipation of the smuggling attempt, Indian agencies maintained close surveillance of fishing vessels operating in the Gulf of Mannar and those near the India-Sri Lanka International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL). The agencies apprehended two boats – a suspicious boat approaching the Mandapam fishing harbour in Tamil Nadu’s Ramanathapuram district and another suspicious vessel south of Mandapam. The sea route between northern Sri Lanka and the southern districts of Tamil Nadu, India, is highly porous and has a lot of fishing activity. In a matter of a few hours and a few dozen kilometres, it is possible to cross over the IMBL and reach the waters of the other side. The first boat attempted to evade the agencies and then dumped the consignment overboard before its three-member crew was apprehended by the agencies. Upon interception, the second boat was said to have 21.269 kg of smuggled gold and its two-member crew was taken into custody. To recover the consignment that was dumped overboard by the first vessel, the Indian Coast Guard launched a diving operation at the site and recovered the gold consignment from the seabed, on Thursday. It contained gold bars weighing 11.6 kg. The entire seized consignment is valued at INR 20.2 core or USD 2.5 million. The seized contraband and suspects are in DRI custody for legal action.  (WION)"

This particular Committee had convened under SLPP MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage last week and its members had deliberated at length on the contribution made towards the national economy by the IRD as well as the input to it by COPA. Chairman of the Committee, Aluthgamage had questioned whether the IRD would be able to further expand State revenue via the new taxation system mooted by the Government. The members of the Committee had pointed out that by misusing provisions contained in the appeal process, certain institutions continue to avoid paying the relevant taxes to the State and those new reforms would need to be introduced to expedite the appeal process as it currently takes a period between two to seven years for its completion. The officers from the IRD, who attended the discussion, also agreed that the perceived delay in the conclusion of the appeal process had prevented them from collecting the requisite taxes to the State. Inland Revenue Commissioner General Ranjith Hapuarachchi had opined that a new judicial system formed specifically to hear taxation cases would need to be established here if the process is to be speeded up. The Head of the Committee then assured that the issue will be brought to the notice of the Justice Minister and measures will be taken to set up a special judicial system for the same. Meanwhile, the Committee also inquired from the IRD officers with regard to the exact documents and letters related to those who pay regular taxes to the State out of a stock of 500,000 such files, but the IRD officials were not armed with the relevant information and the Committee expressed its displeasure over it. The IRD officers were then advised to furnish the required information at the next meeting. In the meantime, the Committee also discussed the matter related to big-time firms that forgo payment of taxes along with importers who do the same. However, it had come to light that the IRD does not have sufficient details regarding the topic. The Committee had also discussed the non-existence of a system to collect necessary data regards large scale deals that are made here. Aluthgamage stressed that this issue needs to be looked at seriously and noted that the law changes should also be undertaken forthwith. Among other matters discussed had been levying of taxes from registered firms, the introduction of new tax files, the staff vacancies at IRD, the tax officers serving at Divisional Secretariats and the RAMIS system."

The Petitioner stated that the statement in question was said in order to bring out the differences contained in the Christian belief as opposed to the beliefs/practices in other religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. He noted that he did not advocate religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. The petitioner further noted that at the relevant sermon he stressed on the fact that love is a part of Christian teaching and while Jesus Christ said “I am the light of the world” (vide Gospel of St. John. Chapter 8 verse 12), Lord Buddha means “the enlightened one” and submitted to the audience that when Lord Buddha was looking for light, he was actually looking for Jesus and that is why every Buddhist needs Jesus by using the words “So, I submit to you, the Buddha was looking for light; he was actually looking for Jesus. This is why every Buddhist needs Jesus..” He went onto state that approximately two weeks after delivering the aforesaid sermon, he left to Singapore, accompanied by his wife and two daughters on 19 May and to attend the Opening of ‘the Glorious Church’ in Singapore on 21 May 2023 and that the plans to attend the said events were made well ahead of the ceremony. The petitioner noted that if he is arrested upon his arrival in Sri Lanka, that would constitute a violation of Article 13(1) of the Constitution and sequel to his arrest, if he is held in custody or detained, that would constitute a violation of Article 13(2) of the Constitution and as such, there is an imminent danger of the infringement of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to him under Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution.

These statistics were presented during a workshop, at the NCPA on 24 May, with the aim of raising awareness among the media about child protection issues. Sajeewani Abeykoon, Director of Law Enforcement at the NCPA, revealed that on average they receive over 600 complaints per month. The highest number of reported cases this year occurred in March, with a total of 1,026 cases. The figures for the first four months of this year are as follows: January – 779 cases, February – 703 cases, March – 1,026 cases and April – 594 cases. Furthermore, the statistics from 2022 indicate a total of 10,497 reported cases.  Abeykoon said, “There was a slight decrease in reported cases during the month of July last year, possibly due to the Aragalaya protest, as the fuel and economic crises may have had a positive impact for the first time. In the previous year, there were a total of 185 serious sexual harassment cases reported, along with 729 minor sexual harassment cases, 167 rape cases, and 132 reported cases of child smuggling.” She also emphasised the importance of raising awareness in society to safeguard children and prevent harm to them. Meanwhile, both Abeykoon and NCPA Director General Anoma Siriwardena revealed that there is a significant shortage of employees within the authority. Abeykoon said, the NCPA should ideally have 618 employees, including Zonal officers, but currently, they only have 288, which is less than half of the required number. Despite their efforts to address the problem by requesting assistance from the government, State authorities and higher officials, no action has been taken in response to the more than one hundred vacancies at the NCPA. “We believe that the authorities working for children should be given priority, but unfortunately, the situation at the NCPA has deteriorated due to the severe shortage of staff to handle cases and fulfil our duties,” said Abeykoon. Furthermore, she revealed that the NCPA has never been adequately staffed. They have inexperienced and untrained interns and out of the required ten lawyers, they only have four to handle all the cases in Court.

MCPA President Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa said on Friday (19), that areas like Moneragala lacked a permanent JMO, placing the people in a situation where they had to pay a large sum of money to take the bodies of their deceased relatives to other hospitals for post-mortem examinations. Post-mortems were delayed due to the resignation or retirement of doctors working in the field of forensic medicine in several districts, including the North and East. It had resulted in placing followers of the Islam faith in a quandary owing to the delays which occur in burials of their dead, he claimed.  He stressed it had given rise to the danger of hospital mortuaries being temporarily shut down due to lack of consultant JMOs and medical officers to support them.  Dr. Sanjeewa said, the issues that had affected the field of specialist clinical medicine was now spreading to the non- specialist clinical medical services (Non-clinical) as a result of the significant number of doctors and specialists serving in State hospitals leaving government service. It was recently revealed that specialist clinical medical services had already stopped in many hospitals, while the Health Ministry said recently that almost five hundred doctors, who were expected to receive new appointments this year had failed to take up their appointments, heightening the crisis, he said. Dr. Sanjeewa said, the greatest pressure of the situation affects the poor and needy patients who sought treatment in rural, estate, maternity and peripheral hospitals. The MCPA President alleged that it was a serious situation as many hospital directors were reluctant to submit facts to the Health Ministry regarding the problems in their respective hospitals.  “The issue was aggravated as the Health Ministry took decisions, according to the needs of some trade unions, in the allocation of doctors and specialists,” he charged. With many reasons prompting medical practitioners to leave the country, including the exorbitant taxes on professionals, the rising cost of living in Sri Lanka, the increase in the amount of debt instalments charged by banks in the next few years and the lack of a plan regarding their children’s education were amongst them. Dr. Sanjeewa said, under these circumstances, the first thing that should be done is to strengthen the free health service and complete the existing shortages rather than introducing one-time paying wards for the purpose of getting money. Meanwhile, Health Ministry sources, when contacted, said that ‘Acting JMO’s’ had been stationed where the position was vacant. However, all those who cry out about shortages of medical practitioners and consultants and medicines should be able to give a comparison in order to explain themselves, they said. They noted that the country which required at least 3,837 consultants, currently had only 3,200. Sources said, that of them over 260 were to go on pension by end of this year.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

In response to the Canadian PM’s statement, the Foreign Ministry said, “Such irresponsible and polarising pronouncements by the leader of a nation breeds disharmony and hatred both in Canada and Sri Lanka, instead of promoting peace and reconciliation.  Sri Lanka urges Canada and its leaders to refrain from making pronouncements from Canada which promote hatred, misinformation and extremist views and to cease its unhelpful focus on Sri Lanka based on distorted facts.  This runs contrary to the Canadian Prime Minister’s stated objective of “safeguarding human rights across the world.”  “Sri Lanka vehemently rejects this unsubstantiated narrative of ‘genocide’ which has been deliberately constructed by politically motivated anti-Sri Lanka elements whose so-called recognition in Canada depends on spreading misinformation and a false narrative of hatred.  We urge caution at a time when the world is combatting the dangers of misinformation, including through social media platforms,” the Foreign Ministry said.  “For over three decades the people of Sri Lanka suffered from the brutal terrorism waged by the ‘LTTE’ one of the world’s most ruthless terrorist organisations which suppressed the lives and democratic rights of all communities, Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese in all parts of the country. The LTTE atrocities included assassinations of Sri Lankan and foreign leaders as well as moderate Tamil leaders. The defeat of this terrorist organisation brought security and stability to Sri Lanka.  The LTTE continues to be proscribed in several democratic countries, including Canada. Many Sri Lankan soldiers were killed and disabled in protecting the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the country,” the ministry elaborated. “Sri Lanka and Canada are linked by a significant community of Canadians of Sri Lankan heritage who maintain a rich and mutually reinforcing relationship between our countries. We urge the Canadian Government and its leaders to leverage this platform to form bonds of friendship and harmony between people and to refrain from polarising communities in both Canada and overseas.  “Despite the socio-economic challenges encountered by the country at present, Sri Lanka has made a cautious start in ushering in stability, recovery and furthering reconciliation for all communities and all segments of the people. We deeply appreciate the support we have received from the international community in this effort. “Both Sri Lanka and Canada are committed to common democratic values, institutions and traditions and to the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of fellow citizens. Sri Lanka wishes to engage with Canada, a longstanding bilateral and development partner, in this spirit of mutual respect and calls on Canada to ensure that its pronouncements are not detrimental to Sri Lanka are overriding national interest of ensuring the prosperity of our people and future generations.” Trudeau on Thursday (18) said, “Today (18 May), we reflect on the tragic loss of lifes during the armed conflict in Sri Lanka, which ended 14 years ago. Tens of thousands of Tamils lost their lifes, including at the massacre in Mullivaikkal, with many more missing; injured, or displaced. Our thoughts are with the victims, survivors, and their loved ones, who continue to live with the pain caused by this senseless violence. The stories of Tamil Canadians affected by the conflict – including many I have met over the years in communities across the country serve as an enduring reminder that human rights, peace, and democracy cannot be taken for granted. That’s why Parliament last year unanimously adopted the motion to make 18 May Tamil Genocide Remembrance Day. Canada will not stop advocating for the rights of the victims and survivors of this conflict, as well as for all in Sri Lanka who continue to face hardship. In October 2022, we joined our international partners in adopting a United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution that calls on the Sri Lankan Government to address the human rights, economic, and political crises in the country. Canada has been a global leader in the adoption of other UNHRC resolutions calling for freedom of religion, belief, and pluralism in Sri Lanka – essential elements to secure peace and reconciliation in the years to come and we will continue our work to safeguard human rights across the world. And in January 2023, our government imposed sanctions against four Sri Lankan Government officials in response to human rights violations on the island.”"

Under the theme ‘Malayagam-200’, a programme began yesterday (20) and will continue today (21) at the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Hall. This programme aims to remember the arrival of Indian Origin workers and highlight the fact that despite the passage of time, the quality of life for the upcountry people has not improved in the 21st century. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardane, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, and several foreign mission heads have been invited to participate in the event. The event will provide insights into the journey taken by the hill country people over the past two centuries, their current situation, and their aspirations for the future. Additionally, a comprehensive discussion on the future of the upcountry people will be a prominent feature of the event. The mobile museum is scheduled to reach the Colombo National Museum on 8 June.

The plan was authorised by the Western Provincial Council as well as the Cabinet. The ‘Coordination Committee on Waste Management in the Western Province’ is to be established to facilitate the implementation of infrastructure development projects in accordance with the master plan and to oversee waste management performances in the Western Province. Kodippiliarachchi expressed her heartfelt appreciation to JICA for the support in solving waste management issues in Western Province. It is stated that the relevant Ministries and Western Province work together to support local authorities for the implementation of the master plan. She also highlighted that the master plan is a valuable and exemplary model that other provinces can follow. Through this project, coordination structures and capacity for the master plan development and implementation have been enhanced. Japan International Cooperation Agency expects that such coordination structures and capacity will continuously play a vital role to achieve appropriate solid waste management in the Western Province."

According to sources in President’s Office, a tri- strategy plan will be implemented within next few days if the Governors remain indifferent to the call by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to resign paving the way for the latter to appoint his representatives in respective provinces. As per the plan, the first strategy would be to appoint a committee headed by a judge to investigate the conduct of these Governors and thereby name them guilty and remove from the position. Second strategy is to appoint new people as Governors and thereby compelling the incumbent to resign. As the third strategy the Central Government will stop funds to the Governors and inform State officials that the incumbent Governors will no longer be considered as the representatives of the President.   According to President’s Office, President Wickremesinghe will however, appoint new Governors prior to his visit to Japan which is scheduled for 22 May. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is reported to have requested Governors of the North-Western, Eastern, Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces to resign from their office. They are Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda, Anuradha Yahampath, Tikiri Kobbekaduwa and A. J. M. Muzammil respectively. According to the reports, they would be replaced by senior members of the United National Party (UNP). This was confirmed by UNP’s Naveen Dissanayake during a media briefing last Sunday. The general practice of Presidents appointing and replacing Provincial Governors without rhyme or reason is common and, as a result, often taken for granted. However, the case is different this time because the Provincial Councils (PCs) and Local Government (LG) institutions do not have elected representatives and thus, the Governors’ function is much more significant.

Convenor, Health Entomology Officers Association (HEOA) Disnaka Dissanayake on Friday (12) said, the Director of the National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) had agreed to research the possibilities of using the method in Sri Lanka when Entomology Officers had first made the proposal. He noted that the method would be economically very profitable and minimises environmental damage if it succeeded. The HEOA Convenor proposed the fumigation method that minimizses the environmental damage such as what is a practice in some countries of the world.  There were objections against fumigation using chemicals due to the environmental damage. An integrated control method should be used by environmental management to deprive the dengue mosquitoes of breeding grounds he observed. At a time when a discourse has been created in the society about fumigation to battle against dengue, “we as health entomology officers are ready to look at the issue from a new angle,” Dissanayake said. He pointed out that fumigation could not be completely overruled because it had to be done to control dengue. He said that a single method could not be followed to battle the disease. A combination of methods such as removal of mosquito breeding places, using chemical methods like fumigation, and the use of biological methods, should be utilised to control the mosquito borne disease.

One of the expert firms from Australia advised the AG’s Department to file the case in Singapore, and based on their advice, the case was filed there,” the Minister said and noted that the AG had hired a legal expert from the UK to remove the limitation of liability in the Xpress Pearl compensation case filed in Singapore. Holding a press conference at his Ministry the Justice Minister did not rule out the possibility of facing challenges even if the case is filed in Singapore. He noted that the ship owners had already sought protection under the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC), which granted them an order limiting their liability to £19.8 million in case of distress or damage to the ship. This order was issued by an Admiralty Court in the UK, the Justice Minister explained. He also stated that if the ship owners do not intervene in the case and if we win, Sri Lanka would be awarded 19.8 million pounds as limitation compensation. However, he noted that Sri Lanka has the right to contest this and remove the limitation as well. The AG should prove whether the ship faced trouble and distress due to the owners or the crew’s negligence. If we can demonstrate that the fire occurred due to the crew’s negligence, the court has the power to remove the limitation liability. Further he noted that it was suggested by the AG that the lawsuit be heard in Singapore due to the vessel being registered there, as well as the operating party or charter party also being based in Singapore. The Attorney General (AG) explained that filing the lawsuit in Colombo Supreme Court and sending legal summons to the bankrupt X-Press Pearl company owners could prove problematic. Instead, the AG proposed utilising the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act of 1930 of Singapore to assist Sri Lanka, and therefore file the lawsuit in Singapore. He recalled that X-Press Pearl MV that caught fire on 20 May 2021 had 1486 containers and with nitric acid of MT 25 a month other cargo such as fertiliser, nurdles and explosive chemicals and caused massive pollution to the country’s coastal belt and the marine life.  He said, over this the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) and the AG’s Department jointly worked to clean up the marine environmental and coastal area claimed USD 10.076 billion as compensation.  He stated that the fishing industry and fishermen have claimed Rs 2,517 million for the damages caused, and this amount has been acquired thus far. He also mentioned that the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) formed an expert committee comprising 40 members, who recommended a compensation of USD 6.4 billion to be obtained from the ship insurer. In the process of claiming the compensation, the team explored various legal options. However, a crucial issue arose regarding the jurisdiction in which to file the lawsuit, either in Sri Lanka or Singapore. As this was a legal matter, neither the minister nor the ministry nor the Parliament was authorised to make a decision. The Attorney General’s (AG) Department, with their team of marine and environmental lawyers, worked on deriving a solution and tabled a proposal with reasons. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Accordingly, there will be 21 members in the Parliament Select Committee. The committee will be tasked with investigating and making suitable recommendations relating to the disasters caused by both international vessels which were gutted in separate fires within Sri Lanka’s territorial waters. MT New Diamond caught fire on 3 September 2020 off the western coast of Sri Lanka, resulting in the death of a Filipino crew member. After burning intermittently for almost a week, the fire was reported extinguished by 11 September 2020. The fire broke out in the engine room of New Diamond when the ship was about 65 km (40 mi) east of Sri Lanka in the Sangaman Kanda Point. At the time, the ship was carrying 270,000 tonnes of oil from Kuwait to the Paradip refinery in India, with 18 Filipino and five Greek crewmembers on board. The cargo was loaded on 23 August 2020 at Mina al Ahmadi and was due to arrive at Paradip on 5 September. The ship was chartered for the voyage by the Indian Oil Corporation. Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) said it believed that the ship’s cargo tanks were intact following the fire, but that a slight oil slick had been sighted, perhaps from the fuel on board. MEPA said that early on 4 September two explosions were reported from New Diamond, though the Sri Lankan Army said that there was no danger of an oil leak at the time. On 20 May 2021, X-Press Pearl caught fire off the coast of Colombo. The vessel was engulfed in flames by 27 May and declared a total loss. It was still afloat, and the fire was thought to be brought under control by Sri Lankan fire-fighters by the late hours of 27 May 2021. After burning for 12 days, the vessel sank on 2 June as it was being towed to deeper waters. The incident was deemed the worst marine ecological disaster in Sri Lankan history due to the chemical products that spilled. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

Speaking in Parliament, Thondaman said, “Infection has spread among patients who recently underwent eye surgery at the Nuwara Eliya District Hospital. It is said that the use of expired medication is to blame for this issue. People who were impacted are currently getting better. In the Cabinet, I will discuss this with the President, the Finance Minister, and the Health Minister. Victims should be compensated. I will take action for that. Speaking further, the minister said the poverty rate in Nuwara Eliya has increased. For estate sector employees, a remuneration of one thousand rupees is insufficient. The Wage Fixing Council is where we’re going. For this, trade union support is crucial, he pointed out. “The inflation rate in 2022 was 60 per cent. It is currently down to 35 per cent. He said inflation is expected to reach single digits by next December. Victims of eye surgery at Nuwara Eliya District Hospital should receive compensation,” he added."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/05/13/haematologist-urges-testing-for-thalassemia/,Haematologist urges testing for Thalassemia,Author not found,0,2023-05-12T20:50:00+00:00," Consultant Haematologist at the Thalassemia Unit of Teaching Hospital Kurunegala, Dr. Manel Ratnayake warned that there was a 25 per cent chance of parents with thalassemia producing a child who was a major disease carrier and urged the couples to do the required tests before thinking of bringing a child into the world. She said on Friday (12) that there were myths in families that have one child with the disease that at least the second would be born without it. But the chances are that even the second child born to parents with the blood disorder would also be a major carrier.  “Men and women should establish whether they are carrier of the disease before marriage,” Dr Ratnayake said, pointing out that knowing how burdensome the disease was to have two three children who were also major disease carriers was a strain on not only the family but also on the Health Ministry.  Meanwhile, addressing a media briefing earlier Professor and a Consultant Paediatrician at the Department of Paediatrics, University of Kelaniya, Sachith G. Mettananda lamented that with advanced healthcare system with a good reach and high level of literacy Sri Lanka had been unable to prevent the emergence of thalassemia patients even by an iota. “Sri Lanka was one of the countries with the large number of thalassemia patients in the world for which there were even historical reasons. But, when considering other countries where thalassemia was prevalent, such as Italy, Greece and Cyprus, where health systems have triumphed against the inherited blood disorder, Sri Lanka had fallen short despite its superior health service. He said that those countries have been able to stop the occurrence of thalassemia patients almost completely. Sri Lanka has about 2,000 patients with Thalassemia spread out in several districts and they are being treated in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura and Ragama treatment centres. Thalassemia is a troublesome disease. A child or an adult with thalassemia should receive a blood transfusion once a month. Donating blood increases iron in the body and therefore it requires further medication to reduce that iron content. “This disease is costly,” he lamented noting that the economic crisis of the last year, had resulted in the collapse of their treatment to a great extent. There were deficiencies in the packets that properly collect blood and there were deficiencies in the medicines that reduce iron in the blood. One reason was the high cost of treatment incurred on the Health Ministry. Prof. Mettananda said, “This is one of the main reasons as to why we should look to reduce the number of thalassemia patients. It is not something that the Health Ministry, paediatricians or medical practitioners could perform. It is a subject that needs to be popularised amongst the people, he noted. The only thing that should be done is to prevent the marriage between two people who are carriers of the genetic disease, he observed. Every Sri Lankan should test to see if he or she is a thalassemia carrier. Those expecting to get married should test and find out if he or she is a carrier. “It you are a carrier it does not mean that you cannot get married, there should be certain factors that should be observed if you are a carrier in order to marry someone who is not,” he explained.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

He lamented that there was a stark absence of a qualified person in pharmacology or at least qualified pharmacist on the Board of the Health Ministry’s arm, established to govern the quality and efficacy of medicinal drugs. This situation which had been prevalent for the past several months only challenged the NMRA’s purpose of having being established. Noting that vested interests and politicisation to be key players in the absence of properly qualified persons to occupy the Board seats, he said that the Authority had initially been tasked with “protecting and improving public health by ensuring medicinal products available in the country meet applicable standards of safety, quality and efficacy.” The NMRA’s job description includes regulating medicines, medical devices, borderline products, clinical trials and cosmetics while the National Medicines Quality Assurance Laboratory (NMQAL) was charged with ensuring the quality of medicines. Dr. Sanjeewa said however that it was questionable as to how far the NMRA had been able to fulfil their duty by the citizens of the country. In a letter, appealing against the awarding of a tender, it was revealed that there were questions regarding the reliability of a NMQAL – the NMRA’s Lab facility report as it was not an accredited laboratory by the SLAB. When medicinal drug companies challenged the accreditation of NMRA’s lab facility to issue “quality failure report’ and the Board of Directors in the Authority itself is lacking at least one authoritative person on medicinal drugs who is to take responsibility when a quality failure occurs. Is it the Health Ministry that takes hurried decisions and withdraw batches of medicinal drugs on such occasions when the country is struggling to stabilise its economy? the MCPA President queried.

He further said the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) blames and makes baseless allegations against others, especially the Government, as it is their political tradition and they use the issues of Tamil people to survive in politics. He also lamented that as long as the ITAK is shackled with such policies, no solution can be found to the problems of the Tamil community as a whole, no matter what efforts are made. The minister alleged that the ITAK does not want to resolve the problems of the Tamil people. He cited their reaction to the meeting President Ranil Wickremesinghe had with Tamil political parties to discuss these issues. “It doesn’t seem that the Tamil factions have any interest or motive to resolve the problem of Tamil people. Several instances in the past were the pre-examples for it,” Devananda said. According to Devananda, only when the problems of Tamil people remain unresolved, these factions can take forward their politics of selfishness. Despite negative predictions and allegations made by many factions regarding the Sri Lankan Government’s efforts to obtain assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and to compensate fishermen affected by the X-press Pearl Ship disaster, both efforts have paid off, Devananda added.

Speaking to Ceylon Today, the State Minister said Sri Lankan adoption law is governed under the provisions of the Adoption of Children Ordinance No. 24 of 1941, and a foreigner may adopt a child under the provisions of the Adoption of Children (Amendment) Act, No. 38 of 1979. As a summary of the procedure included in the said ordinances, the District Court has the jurisdictional power to make legal decisions and judgments to make an adoption order as the upper guardian. After the District Court receives an adoption submission, the Court will assign a probation officer from the Department of Probation and Child Care Service as a guardian to safeguard the child’s interest, she said. “The court will also take into consideration the welfare of the child. The Court can postpone the adoption order and make an interim order giving custody of the child to the applicant for a probationary period of two years. All parties to the adoption must be present in Court on both calling and inquiry dates. The Court may confer the surname of the adopter to the child with the adoption order. For international parents to adopt Sri Lankan children, the parents should be registered with the Sri Lankan Government through any of the diplomatic missions abroad.” Speaking further, Kumarasinghe said it should be legal for a single woman to adopt children under certain conditions and restrictions. She added, “We are in the 21st century, women are independent and most of them are financially stable. Earlier, society was different, and most women had to depend on others, but now it’s different. The eligible age limits of the children should also be amended as well as that of the parents.” By Sanjana Marzook"

The residents of Tailaimannar who had been on the alert following the abduction attempt, had noticed the vehicle used in the abduction bid and after questioning the driver they had detained him and informed the Police. According to statements recorded from the two students, two persons had arrived in the vehicle. Police are interrogating two suspects in this connection. BY Rasadi Chathurangi Gamage – Vavuniya"

NTC Director General Nilan Miranda said, a pilot programme in this regard was held from Galle to Gintota, on the Galle corridor, to minimise the conflicts between the inter-provincial long-distance bus services and provincial bus services, when picking up passengers at certain bus stops. The announcement was made while addressing the media at the Government Information Department during the launch of the pilot programme. Accordingly, the NTC has identified 37 bus stops for inter-provincial long-distance buses from Galle to Gintota on the Galle corridor. NTC Director of Planning K.A.C. Karunarathna said yellow sign boards are displayed along with black sign boards. “Both the provincial and inter-provincial long-distance bus services are permitted to stop at the bus stops where the yellow signboards are displayed. Inter-provincial long-distance buses are not permitted to stop at the bus stops with black sign boards,” she said. Accordingly, inter-provincial long-distance buses will be permitted only at yellow bus stops from 15 May. “Legal action will be taken against the inter-provincial long-distance buses that do not stop at the permitted bus stops as per the prevailing law. This directive will be included as a criterion in the route permit of the NTC,” Karunarathna said adding that internal disciplinary action will be taken against those buses that violate this.  By Nabiya Vaffoor"

In an interview with Ceylon Today, Ratnayake said, he has been challenging the government on the tariff hike on power and if it was someone else on his seat as the Chair of PUCSL, he would have ‘resigned 10 times’ by now. “Despite threats, sealing my office, and removing PUCSL board members in favour of political appointees, I have refused to resign.” Why should I step down? I lost the case when I went to Court to support the Advance Level Students’ exams and asked for electricity for them. I was looking for two hydro Giga units. At the time, they were providing eight million units, and I requested 10 million units (an additional two million units) to avoid power outages. They only turned on the power for two days. They directed the water secretariat not to supply power. They claimed that agriculture required power. In the agricultural sector, they are currently using 13 million units. “How does that sound?” he argued. He stressed when he went to Court the three PUCSL members were with him, but they resigned and two political appointees came in and they are against him. “I am not in a precarious situation despite facing challenges from all sides including the three PUCSL members,” added the Chairman.  “I’m going about my daily business. Only specific issues require the PUCSL members’ approval, otherwise not. In the past two months, I’ve accumulated 50 board papers. The three members claimed that because of the allegations against me, they could not attend board meetings. He said, they should comply if they took over the position.  They cannot refuse to attend meetings, he pointed out.  According to the PUCSL Act, they lose their positions if they miss three meetings. “They did not come for two board meetings. They may come for the third one otherwise they are out,” he added.    By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

That person shouldn’t have any ties to the politics of the previous 75 years and ought to bring about a paradigm shift in this country. The person ought to be competent and capable and someone who has a plan to boost the economy and transform people,” he said adding, “That person is me.” In an interview with Ceylon Today, he called the Government to reform the mindset of politicians. Also, the Government should implement better policies if they want to change the political and economic landscape, he added. Ratnayake said, “I have said I would consider entering politics. I started business in early 90s in IT and then transformed it to real estate and banking, leisure etc. I have been associating with politicians in the last two decades. I have been seen as the top man always. Not for my business, but from early 2000 until now I have been with the top most politicians. I have been helping Gotabaya Rajapaksa during his presidential campaign.  He had an office in my office building. I sponsored his office space. I also helped Mahinda Rajapaska in 2005 and in 2010. I also helped Maithripala Sirisena during his presidential campaign.” He said in Sri Lanka, “the right policies have not been implemented ever.” The PUCSL is a body that makes policies. If you disregard the rules, the issue will persist for another 75 years. Politicians should learn to respect national policies and refrain from objecting to appointed commissions. Even the Election Commission is unable to hold elections because the stupid Secretary of the Treasury claims they do not have Rs 9 billion for the elections, he claimed. “I would say that the Government spends Rs 9 billion every hour. How in the world can the CEB claim that it lacks the resources to hold elections if it earnsRs 50 billion annually?” he questioned.  Speaking further, the PUCSL Chairman alleged that former President Gotabaya Rajapakasa lacked common sense. “When we urged not to lower the tariff they went against it. They did not pay attention when we suggested using 40% coal and 60% renewable energy. It is time to alter public perception, not change the politicians,” he stressed. He pointed out that politics requires a paradigm shift. Can the economy withstand increased borrowing? They boast about having USD 3 billion thanking the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, the IMF only grants USD 300 million every four months while the CEB generates USD 2 billion in revenue. Because CEB revenue is improperly managed, they refer to it as a losing entity. Now under the new tariff increase from last August to February of this year, the CEB has now received new additional revenue of USD 1.5 billion annually, which is more than the IMF bailout, he said. Moreover, Ratnayake said Sri Lanka is in debt to a total of USD 54 billion and additionally, there is a loan from the World Bank and USD 3 billion loan from the IMF. “It would be more than USD 60 billion. If we are unable to pay USD 54 billion, how can the USD 60 billion be paid?” he said. There are awkward visa policies in the country, Ratnayake stressed. “If you have the means, you can migrate to Australia, Canada, or the USA. Even if someone has USD 200 million, will they come to Sri Lanka with the current visa policies?” he queried. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said on Friday (5), that the Health Ministry and the Provincial Directors Health Services of the Eastern and North Western Provinces had imposed restrictions on the Medical Offices of Health (MOHs) and the public health workers preventing them from working on Sundays and holidays. This has led to the collapse of control and prevention work carried out. It is not something that could be done during a disaster like situation such as the current escalation in dengue, he pointed out. “It is the kind of administrative decision which has given a rise to the number of dengue cases in the Western Province in which Gampaha District, with over 6,500 dengue cases surpasses Colombo which currently has a few over 6,170 cases during the first 17 weeks of 2023. In Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Puttalam and Kurunegala there are 1,265, 1,172, 2,283 and 1,000 cases respectively within this period,” he stressed. The GMOA Secretary stressed on the need for inter-sectoral collaboration in disaster mitigation rather than hindering the services being carried out. Dr. Aluthge also said, fever was a symptom for dengue, Covid-19, influenza, diarrhoea conditions. However, under the current situation patients should think that they may have dengue and act accordingly. He urged fever patients to rest at home. “If you are going for work then stay at home, children going to school should be kept at home,” he explained.  Also, increase the fluid intake while drinking natural fluids such as orange juice, king coconut and tender coconut water, boiled and cooled water, rice kanji and soup. Refrain from taking soft drinks or aerated drinks. Dr. Aluthge said however, that children could be given cream soda if necessary to maintain the fluid intake during this period. He said, only paracetamol should be taken according to the recommended dosage. “However, seek immediate medical attention preferably from the Out Patients’ Department (OPD) of a State hospital or one’s family doctor, if fever prevails for more than one day.” The GMOA Secretary said, a Full Blood Count (FBC) was necessary in order to help the medical practitioner diagnose the disease. Further tests could be carried out on his or her recommendation. Fielding questions, he said that only limited amount of the reagent required for FBC testing was available in State Hospitals. However, it was being managed so, that all necessary FBC tests could be done. Private hospitals also carry out FBC tests, he said urging patients not to remain at home till they developed dengue haemorrhagic fever. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/04/29/health-ministry-experimenting-with-dengue-issue-aheo/,Health Ministry experimenting with dengue issue – AHEO,Author not found,0,2023-04-28T20:50:00+00:00," The Health Ministry was contemplating minimising the use of chemicals for fogging in dengue control work, at a time when at least 1,800 to 2,000 patients are being diagnosed per week, the Association of Health Entomology Officers (AHEO) said. National Convenor AHEO Disnaka Dissanayake said on Friday (28), that there is no room for experimenting as chemicals are used for fogging purposes in mosquito control. Now the Health Ministry wants to use biological methods while minimising the chemical use, he alleged. The country needs a proper national policy on dengue control and not just slapdash policies, he said, adding that the lack of a national policy should be formulated with the participation of all stakeholders to ensure that the country was able to bring the dengue situation under control. According to the National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) from January to April this year there has been 28,446 cases, while last year from January to December 2022 there were over 76,680 cases. He said, that the Unit had revealed that there had been 15 dengue deaths from January till date, while last year there were a total 72 dengue deaths recorded. This situation should be brought under control as urgently as possible or Sri Lanka would be unable to cope. “We can accommodate 500 to 600 patients in hospitals, but hospitals would find it difficult to cope with as many as 1,800 to 2,000 cases per week as is being diagnosed at present,” the Joint Convenor noted. With the South Westerly monsoons ahead there were high possibilities that the number of cases being diagnosed would increase even further. “The Ministry was contemplating minimising the use of chemicals for dengue control work at a time when at least 1,800 to 2,000 patients were being diagnosed per week would be equivalent to measures taken a few months earlier to stop the use of chemical fertiliser causing an upheaval in the agriculture sector. There is no room for experimenting, he said, noting that chemicals were used for fogging purposes in mosquito control. Dissanayake said, according to statistics issued by the NDCU 62% of the dengue patient load from January to end April were those in the country’s workforce. It is a blow to the country’s economy which was already unstable. Therefore, measures should be taken to address the issue mobilising teams within workplace to monitor the situation. Also, the NDCU notes that 25 per cent of those diagnosed with the infection are schoolchildren. Children are exposed in schools and in the tuition classes. Therefore, the Health Ministry should collaborate with the Ministry of Education and parent forums to come up with a more successful programme to safeguard children against the mosquito-borne diseases. Therefore, without experimenting at this juncture, measures should be taken to utilise all available methods – such as chemicals to fog, biological method. He said, currently diesel was utilised with the chemical for fogging. But water too, could be used. There was on-going research in this regard.  People should also be educated from a young age to adulthood to know the dengue mosquito’s breeding grounds or that using a net in the night would not be a protection against its bite and its flying range.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

State Minister of Urban Development and Housing Arundika Fernando was present on the occasion. India’s Deputy High Commissioner Vinod K Jacob participated in the inauguration and welcomed the delegation led by the highly decorated director, actor, screenwriter and lyricist from  Kannada cinema, Dr. Nagathihalli Chandrashekaran to the workshop. Speaking on the occasion, the Deputy High Commissioner said, “At a time when India and Sri Lanka are celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations, it is indeed timely that we are having this workshop.” Wishing that the workshop would contribute to deepening people to people ties, he highlighted six main observations during the course of his speech. “First, every year, more than 2000 films are made in India. In 2011, the total number of cinema tickets sold were 3.5 billion. The history of Indian cinema is more than 100 years old. The pioneering filmmaker was Dadasaheb Phalke, who is known as the father of Indian cinema. He gave India the first full length silent feature film titled Raja Harishchandra on 3 May 1913. Through this long journey, Indian cinema has enriched Indian society and vice versa. The movies have tackled issues like nationalism, women’s and children’s rights, caste, religion, class and the like. “Second, looking at the more than 100-year-old journey of Indian cinema and how we responded to the restrictions of Covid 19, there are some interesting trends. The fact that RRR’s Naatu Naatu won the Best Original track at the latest Academy Awards is a testimony to the ability of Indian cinema to innovate,” he said and quoted a report which estimated that Hindi theatre-going universe shrank by 21.5 per cent compared to pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, most South Indian languages have shown stability or growth, with Kannada gaining the most at 25%, from 1.16 crore to 1.45 crore. He continued, “Third, it is important to recognise that commercial success is an essential element of the progress of the Indian cinema. Equally, this is a fluid concept. Among the earliest examples in this regard is the success of the 1951 movie Awara which set a record in terms of collection, it was overtaken in 1952 itself with collections for the movie Aan. This year, the movie Pathaan has set fresh records. However, related to this is the aspect of success in terms of creative content which cannot only be measured by collections. Convergence of these two aspects namely the commercial and the creative depends in large measure on the audience. “Fourth, Kannada cinema has come a long way since the first talkie Sati Sulochana in the 1930s. Its output has been prolific and contributed to the vitality of Indian cinema and indeed Indian society. The KGF series is fresh in everyone’s minds but the workshop will educate about the versatility of Kannada cinema. “Fifthly, the ecosystem that enables Indian cinema flows from the freedom of speech and expression which is a fundamental right in the Indian Constitution. The Cinematograph Act of 1952 is the main piece of legislation in this regard. As is normal in any other jurisdiction, there are structures and mechanisms that govern censorship, copyright and piracy including digital piracy. “Finally, the Government and people of India have stood by the people of Sri Lanka and have given support to the tune of USD 4 billion. This has been in line with the Government’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy. It is important that Sri Lankan friends appreciate that such a policy can be successful only if the people of India support these initiatives. The Indian people continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka,” Deputy High Commissioner Jacob concluded."

One of the main challenges mentioned by the President was related to the Mahaweli Development Authority and its lands, which are now being resolved. Another issue that was discussed extensively was the regional plantation companies. The President pointed out that the main challenge faced by regional plantations is the leases that are due to expire in the next 10 or 15 years. He stressed that if the Government is going ahead with agricultural modernisation, it will have to give new leases. However, the President instructed the members of the Plantation Reform Committee (PRC) to find a basis for granting new leases, as not all companies have performed well. He also instructed them to update the survey conducted in 2018 to assess the performance of the companies and determine the basis for granting new leases. During the meeting, the President suggested that companies should not be allowed to sell their shareholdings without the consent of the Government, once they have been given land. Additionally, he revealed that the Government is planning to introduce gemming on the land as part of its efforts to modernize agriculture into agribusinesses. The PRC was asked for their views on this matter. Other issues discussed during the meeting included housing in the plantation sector, challenges affecting the three main crops (tea, rubber and coconut) that come under the plantation sector, and problems pertaining to tea plantation line-rooms and housing. The meeting also focused on a pilot project where land is being subcontracted to workers and issues related to Land Reform Commission (LRC) were given priority.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/04/29/president-pledges-sri-lanka-will-take-the-lead/,President pledges Sri Lanka will take the lead,Author not found,0,2023-04-28T20:30:00+00:00,"It is not solely the responsibility of developing countries such as Sri Lanka to mitigate climate change in the world, but developed countries, which are the primary contributors to polluting the environment, should also contribute to the cause through funding, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed during the Presidential Environment Awards 2021-2022 ceremony held on Friday (28), at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo. The President noted that Sri Lanka will take the lead in ensuring that the developing economies receive the resources to mitigate climate change. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe acknowledged the need for new laws to establish Sri Lanka as a green economy. He announced that several new laws would be introduced in the coming years to address this issue. At the ceremony organised by the Central Environmental Authority, 90 individuals received awards under the main sectors of industries, businesses and projects, institutions, media, and society. President Ranil Wickremesinghe presented the gold awards, and Environment Minister Naseer Ahmed presented the President with a plaque. After the award presentation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe also posed for a group photograph with the gold award winners. Following is the full speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Presidential Environment Awards; “I must commend all those who are among the award winners for the contribution you have made to improve the environment of this country. To them, I say thank you. The previous speakers before me have outlined to you what Sri Lanka is doing in respect of environment and I do not wish to deal with those issues. I would like to mention to you during the debate on the IMF and earlier, I mentioned the need for a new economy, a highly competitive economy which is also a digital economy and a green economy. So, as the economic reforms and the restructuring begins, it also involves Sri Lanka becoming a green economy. So that’s a start and there is a lot more work that has to be done. So, as we become a green economy, we also need the legislation and there will be a lot of new legislation in the coming years such as a new Environmental Act, because our environmental Act was passed in the 80’s and there have been far more advances thereafter. A Climate Change Act, Living Entities Act, we would like to have Sinharaja, Horton Plains, Peak Wilderness, Knuckles and Mahaweli as living entities and we will have to look at the Forest Act and bring in a new one will  also cater for reforestation law to protect the Muthurajawela Swamp and one on protecting scenic beauties. So, there is a large number of laws that have to be drafted and presented in the coming year. In addition to it, Sri Lanka intends to play a role in the global campaign for climate change mitigation and that is going to be the Climate Change University which we proposed here and that will be used by officials, NGO’s  and others for  training in climate change and also for post graduate awards. So, this is our scheme in going ahead and giving priority to climate change mitigation, environment and a green economy. What we are faced with and a lot of developing countries are faced with is a lack of resources. How do we access them? Are we getting the carbon credits? There are many financial schemes and instruments available. How can all of us in all the countries attempt to get the benefit of these schemes? Sri Lanka as a country is certainly looking at how we can benefit and how we can apply for the schemes. But the question is that Sri Lanka alone cannot change the climate change in the world. We alone cannot do it, the whole world has to do it, and there the question comes up, is there enough funding for all this? How do you find the money, the financial resources for these especially for climate change mitigation and protecting the environment? Now, this is a question we have to ask because the actual damage was not done by us. The damage was done by the West and the other countries that decided to develop. So the developed countries through the process of industrialization, a number of wars, especially the two World Wars and even the Vietnam War have all contributed to bringing about the climate change. Now, we have to suffer the consequences. So, what we say is that funding has to come. In addition to what we have and what we can raise, there has to be funding available from those who are responsible for it. As far as we are concerned, we cannot put all the money into climate change. We have to fund education; we have to look at health, infrastructure and all those have to be met with.   Then, where does the money come from? Some in the developed world says there is not enough money. To me that is not an answer at all. The last conference of parties adopted the loss and damage principle. Again this means, for the loss and damage there must be money, but if the financial resources can’t come, well, it’s like a judgment that cannot be executed because one party hasn’t got the money.  So we have to ask because it’s not like the world hasn’t got the money. If you look at the money that has been spent on the Ukraine war, on one side, Russia is spending a lot of money and on the other side it is the West. USA alone has given a 100 billion dollars to Ukraine.  Then you have the Indo-Pacific and the rising tensions and how all sides are building more aircraft carriers, they are building more planes, they are strengthening their defenses. There is over 100 billion there alone over the next few years. So you have America on one side, China on the other side and India on one side, there is Japan and Australia and others who are spending money. So look at the amount of money spent on armament and various other purposes. So, there is money and that money has to be made available.  The other problem that we have in the developing world is that most countries are reeling under the debt. Sri Lanka is one of the first countries and has taken steps to get out of it, but that alone is not enough. A large number of countries that are reeling under debt will have no resources for climate change mitigation. So, these are two sides of the coin. Funding for climate change mitigation projects and access for that funding and secondly, the debt issues of the developing economies. These are two issues that are actually joined. So this is what we have to raise and discuss. Sri Lanka certainly, will take this position as we go in for the next round of conferences regarding the environment and the climate. I thought I would outline for you what we are planning to do, both locally and internationally. The Environment Minister will be leading the international efforts supported by the Foreign Affairs Ministry but this will be one of the key plans of our foreign policy. We have no doubt that Sri Lanka will take the lead in ensuring that the developing economies have the resources certainly to mitigate climate change in their areas.” Meanwhile, addressing the gathering, Minister of Environment Mr Naseer Ahmed said, “It is the President’s deeply held belief that the environment lies in the core of everything we do in this country. As we work to protect our environment we also work to protect our health our communities our families and our nation. That is why the President has paid special attention and recognition to the individuals and entities of this country who have worked so diligently to safeguard our waters, air and land. They are our nation’s future and these people and entities we honour today are working hard to protect the world of the future. The world that our children will inherit. It is also a great pleasure to see the enthusiasm of the business sector and the community in conserving the environment. We are recognizing today 90 exceptional individuals and entities from across the nation who has applied ingenuity, commitment and a deep concern about the world around them to the critically important task of safeguarding our environment. These awards honour all of these individuals and their entities for taking extraordinary steps to learn about local environmental problems, to educate others and most importantly to take action for their communities by helping clean the air we breathe, the water we drink and the land  we live on. Under the visionary leadership of the President, the government is taking the lead in implementing various measures to protect our biological diversity and mitigate and adapt to climate change impact.” Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Chairman of the Central Environment Authority Supun S. Pathirage, Director General P.B. Hemantha Jayasinghe, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau Chairman R. Sanjeepan, Director General Ajith Prem and many others were present on this occasion."

The Ministry claims that victims are illegally transported from Thailand, primarily into Myanmar, where they are held captive and forced to work under harsh, constricting conditions. Authorities have also detained a few of the victims for breaking in illegally. Due to the current economic crisis, there has been a sudden increase in Sri Lankan youth finding jobs abroad. This pattern of exodus has led to fake job offers and human traffickers taking advantage of the situation to profit financially.  All of these victimised Sri Lankans entered Thailand on tourist visas with the intention of changing them to work visas once there, but this was not successful. According to the Laotian Times newspaper, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) has received 15 complaints regarding Sri Lankan citizens being trafficked into Laos on alleged job scams. The complaints have been filed by youths hailing from the South of Sri Lanka. The Bureau said that, with the exception of a few, the rest of its citizens remain trapped in Laos. The Honorary Consulate of Sri Lanka in Laos also issued a statement last week stating that it is in the process of repatriating Sri Lankan citizens who have been scammed into Laos.  “At the moment, we are cooperating and communicating with the Laos authorities and the Sri Lankan Embassy in Bangkok. Hopefully, they will be able to return home in a couple of days,” said a Spokesperson from the Honorary Consulate of Sri Lanka in Laos. The Foreign Affairs Ministry said, Sri Lankan nationals are advised not to get enticed and entrapped in such fraudulent job offers and they are requested to exercise extreme caution and verify the background of recruiting agents as well as any company before taking up any job offer. Some of the Sri Lankans, it is reported, had sought employment abroad only to become victims of human trafficking at the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the Province of Bokeo, Laos.

The number of elephant deaths due to shooting, electrocutions and hakka patas has also increased, compared to other years.

Health authorities decided to withdraw batches of an anaesthetic drug following the controversial death of a pregnant woman at the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital recently. Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe urged the Health Ministry to initiate a departmental investigation into the withdrawal of the drug batches and the death of the woman following the caesarian section. He said that it was regrettable that the Health Ministry had to take such decisions at a time when the country’s health service was facing a severe drug crisis. Therefore, an investigation should be conducted into the entire incident which led to the withdrawal “as we cannot afford such indulgences at this time,” he observed. Dr. Wijesinghe said Sri Lanka would not be facing such a situation with regard to the quality and efficacy of medicinal drugs that were imported, through the loans the country had received, or with those that were donated had there been a well-equipped laboratory for testing medicines before issuing them to State hospitals. The Government had proposed the setting up of such a Quality Assurance lab facility in the 2009 budgetary proposal. But that was that and the matter had never been broached afterwards so that during a crisis like the one the country is facing at present, hard core decisions such as withdrawing drug batches have to be taken. Recalling the incident of a woman who died in the private sector following abdominal surgery, the Media Committee Member of the GMOA said that although an investigation had been conducted even at that time, the public had not been made aware of the outcome. It is important for people and patients to know the outcome of such investigations as it may severely impact the patient’s mind set and lead to a larger calamity. For instance, failing to tell the public of the investigation’s outcome may prompt patients to take decisions of undergoing or not undergoing medical procedures that are life threatening.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The discussions turned into heated arguments as one group believes that stern action should be taken against SJB members who are Ministers in the present Government, while another faction believes that doing so will cause a schism within the party.

Following media reports MCPA President, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa called for a probe into the mother’s death after her first delivery as a result of the importation of substandard drugs, as had been suspected by the Hospital and had prompted the Health Ministry to withdraw all batches of that particular anaesthetic drug, which had been used on her during the caesarean surgery, as was revealed. “If the use of a substandard drugs was the cause of the woman’s death, the Minister of Health and the Health Secretary should be held directly responsible for her death,” Sanjeewa charged. Lashing out, the MCPA President said the Health Minister and his officials should be held accountable for the drug shortage the country was facing as well as the increase in the price of drugs. They should also take responsibility for the importation of substandard drugs, he added.  Dr. Sanjeewa said that although malicious comments had been made by certain self-interested parties, on various occasions against the MCPA and its  complaint to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, that the Health Minister and Health authorities should be held responsible for the shortage of drugs in Sri Lanka, the increase in the price of drugs and the importation of substandard drugs, the Supreme Court last week had temporarily suspended the importation of Indian pharmaceuticals using its credit line until a further Court order. Dr. Sanjeewa noted that this was a victory for the MCPA efforts to prevent further catastrophe from befalling the country’s health service.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne "

He added that the Department of Wildlife Conservation is also under the purview of the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation and not the Ministry of Agriculture. He stated thereby that if the Ministry of Agriculture makes a decision in regard to the export of toque monkeys instead of the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation, such decision would be faulty before law. Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera previously stated that 100,000 toque monkeys will be sent to China to be displayed in zoos, adding that this is in an effort to control the monkey population in Sri Lanka and with a view to reduce damage caused by the animals to cultivations.

Dr. Perera said children below two years, pregnant women, adults over 65 years, and immunocompromised persons were vulnerable to Influenza A and B and could develop severe complications. Pregnant women should inform their gynaecologist if they contract the infection, he said. Dr. Perera, when contacted on Wednesday (12), said the amount charged by the private sector hospitals varied from Rs 4,000 toRs 7,000. “However, it would be greatly appreciated if the private sector could also reduce the charges levied from patients for influenza testing,” he said. He said the Medical Research Institute (MRI) conducted testing for the viral infection for the LRH. Identifying symptoms, Dr. Perera said they included fever, cough, runny nose, vomiting and at times increase in eye discharge. The viral infection lasts for between two to seven days. It is a rapidly spreading disease while a majority of children were infected with the disease earlier, but now with school holidays and children being at home it is notable that other family members also contract the virus so siblings and adults all sought treatment for the influenza infection. The Consultant Paediatrician said the vaccine for influenza was available in the private sector. However, as the virus causing the infection mutates, the vaccine has to be taken annually. Also, this is an infection which is prevalent in Western countries. “It is best to prevent oneself from contracting the disease altogether by taking precautionary measures such as maintaining hand hygiene by washing hands or using a sanitiser, using one’s elbow when sneezing and not the hand, wearing a mask if one has symptoms of the infection and while using public transport would help in preventing the disease spread,” he said.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Chandani Kumari Jayasinghe (39) came to Ratmalwetiya, Galenbindunuwewa about two years ago, while being pregnant with her third child as she and her two sons could not bear the physical and mental harassment of her drug addict husband anymore. Even though, the father is considered to be the pillar of strength and hero of any family, Chandani had to play both roles of father and mother to her children, ever since her husband became difficult and a burden to the family after he got addicted to ICE. Chandani’s eldest son is studying in the 10th Grade and is 14-years-old and her second son who is 7-years-old and is in Grade 2. She works hard throughout the day to earn a few pennies to feed her three kids and provide for the education of her two older sons. Her drug addict husband abandoned her and the children for another woman while she was pregnant with her third child. Chandani continued to face each day courageously for some time yet, now has reached a point where she is compelled to seek the help of those with empathetic and kind hearts. This is due to her youngest child being diagnosed with a hole in the heart condition (two holes) and Thalassemia. Having to rush to hospital frequently with her feeble toddler (2) at least two to three times a week in addition to visiting hospital’s routine fortnight clinics, she has no time left to earn by doing an odd job for a daily wage. I can’t leave the sick kid unattended to earn something to feed the other two and if I do so, I’ll have to worry if my toddler has fallen sick in my absence, Chandani lamented. To add to her agony, the makeshift house and land she’s living with her children has been reclaimed by the owner who has asked her to leave the premises as she is unable to pay the rent. “They were kind enough to let me and the kids to occupy the house on minimum rent. However, they want the house back as I was unable to pay the rent for the past several months as I don’t have a proper or stable income,” Chandani said. The Galenbindunuwewa Divisional Secretary, after learning about Chandani’s plight, has made arrangements to give a 20-perch land from the area and made her eligible to receive Rs 3,000 as a monthly Samurdhi allowance. The Divisional Secretariat also arranged Rs 1,500 per month to assist in the education of the two schoolchildren. However, as it is not adequate to fulfil the requirements of four, especially two school children and a sick child, Chandani appeals to anyone willing to assist her and the children to build a permanent house in the land she received and for her children to continue education and obtain necessary healthcare. Anyone willing to contribute could do so by depositing money to account number 71808742 of Galenbindunuwewa Branch of the Bank of Ceylon, as every penny will help Chandani to look after her three children.

Airlines around the world have been buffeted by the impact of countries closing their borders during the pandemic and soaring fuel prices due to the Ukraine war. State-owned SriLankan Airlines is also facing the worst economic crisis for decades in its home country. Its British-born boss told the BBC how he plans to turn the firm around. “I think the first lesson for me is don’t ever go and be a CEO during Covid,” Richard Nuttall, the Chief Executive of SriLankan Airlines, jokes when asked what his biggest takeaway is from the last two years. Nuttall has spent decades in the airline industry, working with names including Cathay Pacific and Philippine Airlines. He became the Chief Executive of SriLankan Airlines in April last year, after joining the company in November 2021 as its Chief Commercial Officer. He joined the loss-making carrier after Sri Lanka eased its coronavirus border restrictions and hopes were high that the firm was set to see a recovery in passenger numbers. However, the economic problems that had been dragging on the country since before the pandemic deepened in the summer of 2021. A series of missteps by the Government resulted in the worst economic crisis since the country’s independence, depleting Sri Lanka’s foreign reserves needed to import everything from food to fuel. Soaring prices saw protesters taking to the streets, which hammered the country’s tourism industry, which was vital to its economy. Countries that advised their citizens to not travel to Sri Lanka smacked of “double standards”, Nuttall said. “In the West, protest is a sign of democracy and nobody issues travel advisories. But when you have a protest in somewhere like Sri Lanka, everybody slaps on travel advisories.” In February, Sri Lanka secured a USD 3 billion (£ 2.4 billion) bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As part of the plan to rebuild its shattered economy, the Government aims to raise funds by privatising SriLankan Airlines. In February this year, unable to meet interest payments due end of the year, the company defaulted on a USD 175 million (£ 140 million) bond. Nuttall highlighted that, while he was not against selling off the business, there was still a lot of work to be done to restructure its debt before that can happen. “If we can structure that debt, then a large part of what we’re paying as interest comes back and can be used to run the airline,” he said. “And it means that an outside investor can come in and not pay for the sins of the past.” (BBC)"

Ltd, on 6 April. TISL had filed this Petition against the steps taken by the Cabinet of Ministers, the Minister of Health, the Ministry of Health and the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) to procure medical supplies from two Indian private companies. The Supreme Court, while noting that serious doubts have arisen regarding the lawfulness of the impugned procurement transaction, have granted two interim reliefs by demanding the suspension of further imports of pharmaceuticals pertaining to the decision without obtaining a further order from the Court after proving that the quality and safety requirements are satisfied, and the procurement is lawful, and ordering release for use the two consignments that have already reached Sri Lanka only after the conducting necessary tests, and the NMRA expressing its independent decision assuring the safety, quality, and efficacy of the mentioned pharmaceuticals. The petition was filed by TISL on 16 February, in the public interest, challenging the role of the Cabinet of Ministers in procuring medical supplies through unregistered private suppliers, the role of the NMRA in providing a Waiver of Registration to procure medical supplies from unregistered suppliers, non-compliance with procurement guidelines, including the emergency procurement process and abuse of process by the Minister of Health and the CEO of the NMRA. Further, TISL alleged that the citizens’ fundamental right to equality (Article 12(1)) and the right of access to information (Article 14A) had been violated, along with serious disregard for the health, safety and well-being of the people and in total abuse of public trust and public funds during this controversial procurement of medical supplies. The petition was heard before the bench comprising Justices Murdu Fernando, Yasantha Kodagoda, and Achala Wengappuli. Attorney-at-Law Senany Dayaratne represented the Petitioners with Attorneys Nishadi Wickramasinghe, Sankhitha Gunaratne and Lasanthika Hettiarachchi.

The HRCSL comprises five members. This letter has been sent with the signatures of HRCSL Commissioners Dr. Vijitha Nanayakkara, Dr. Nimal Karunasiri and Ven. Kalupahana Piyarathana Thera. The commissioners in the letter claimed the HRCSL Chairperson is acting contrary to the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission Act. “Also, she is not listening to the opinions and suggestions of the members of the commission and is acting according to her personal wishes,” they alleged. They also claimed that as the Chairperson continued to ignore the decisions taken by the majority of the commission members, the members took steps not to approve the proposals of the HRCSL in February and March. These three commissioners have also decided not to approve any of the Chairperson’s decisions in protest of her conduct. They alleged in the letter that the Chairperson is acting in a certain manner with expectations of receiving a post at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva. They requested the relevant authorities to look into this matter urgently.  The crisis within the HRCSL was clearly visible when the commission issued summons on 9 March to Public Security Minister Tiran Alles to appear before it on 13 March.  However, on 12 March, the HRCSL Chairperson issued a fresh statement to “clarify” the “erroneous” statements in the media, with regard to the summons issued to the Minister. Four out of the five HRCSL members insisted that they did not take a decision to summon Minister Alles to appear before the commission to record a statement on the conduct of the Police during undergraduate protests in early March, and said they were completely unaware of such a decision."

According to the Minister of Ports, the logistics centre will cost around USD 500 million to build and the South Asia Commercial and Logistics Hub (SCLH) of the Colombo International Container Terminal, a subsidiary of China’s CM Ports, has been chosen as the logistics centre’s contractor. Once completed, an investor will be chosen to manage it on a 35-year lease. The Minister added that the warehouse is a new business that will determine which containers should be sent to which areas, and so on. Some consignments must enter the cold storage facility. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority will receive 15 per cent of the profit once it is managed by the investor.  The proposed logistics centre will be awarded to the private sector, and the contractor will complete the warehouse within the next three years. At present, there are insufficient facilities such as cold storage. Minister of Ports and Shipping Nimal Siripala de Silva said this logistics centre will end congestion at the Port.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/04/08/having-x-press-pearl-hearing-in-singapore-will-benefit-ship-owners/,Having X-Press Pearl hearing in Singapore will benefit ship owners,Author not found,0,2023-04-07T20:50:00+00:00," On the Cabinet decisions to file a case in a Singapore Court against the X-Press Pearl vessel owners, Attorney-at-Law/Legal Counsel, an expert in Law of the Sea and Maritime Law Dr. Dan Malika Gunasekera said, going to Singapore has its disadvantages for Sri Lanka as there are many International Conventions that apply in Singapore, as opposed toSri Lanka. The Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) warned last week that if legal action is not taken in connection with the MV X-Press Pearl ship fire within the next 45 days, Sri Lanka will have to forfeit its right to compensation worth an estimated USD 10 billion and that the decision to pursue legal action in Singapore was made by the Cabinet, the Ministry of Justice, and the Attorney General’s Office, which has led to uncertainty. Additionally, Sri Lanka has borrowed USD 4.5 million to support this effort. He further explained that Sri Lankan Marine Pollution Prevention Act and other laws cannot be used in Singapore and further emphasised that Sri Lanka is under no obligation to travel to Singapore and that the Cabinet and Parliament could revert the decision in doing so, in order to bring a lawsuit against the Xpress Pearl vessel, which had polluted the country’s ecosystem in Sri Lanka. The Attorney General’s (AG) Office recently moved for a Cabinet Paper requesting that the X-Press Pearl disaster case be allowed to be filed in Singapore and the Cabinet approved it. This occurred after President Ranil Wickremesinghe also gave the Justice Minister instructions to draft a Cabinet Paper outlining how to approach the arbitration court and specifying the dollar amount of damages that should be sought from the shipping company. Dr. Gunasekara added, “When we travel to Singapore, the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC) amended by the 1996 protocol will also be in effect. As we are not a party to the LLMC, there are no limitation proceedings that are applicable in Sri Lanka under Sri Lankan law. As a result, the ship owner or the ship insurer, the P&I Club of London, would benefit from being able to limit their liability.” Therefore, he opined that if the case is heard in Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka is at an advantage. “We have every statutory instrument required to file the action in Sri Lanka. We can very easily file the action in the Commercial High Court’s Admiralty Court, because this Court is designated under the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act to handle cases involving damage caused by ships,” he underscored. Additionally, the Marine Pollution Prevention Act stipulates provisions for obtaining civil damages imposing liability on the ship owner, operator, and insurer, which is the London P&I Club. Due to the fact that both London and Sri Lanka are signatories to the convention of the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments, any judgment rendered by a Sri Lankan Court can be easily enforced against the P&I club in London, UK. A judgment upheld in Singapore cannot be utilised to penalise the UK-based ship insurer London P&I club because Singapore is not yet a party to that particular convention. What is further learnt is that the cost factor of taking the witnesses from Sri Lanka to Singapore with all of the evidence and documentation will cost more in US dollars at the end of the mission, and there are other financial drawbacks as well. It is believed that a Singapore lawyer would approximately charge USD 5 million as an advance payment for the case. Notifying the respondents is also not a complicated issue because the pertinent information has already been disclosed in other cases that the CEJ has brought before the Supreme Court. “We see no issues with moving forward with the case in Sri Lanka; it is the most cost-effective course of action, as it is unlikely that we will succeed in having the Singapore Court rule in our favour. Sri Lankan Courts benefit from favourable geographic conditions,” added the maritime expert. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

However, the Government is open to a joint venture and may even take investors into account if they are prepared to develop the Trincomalee port terminals. The Minister continued, “On any count we will not compromise navigation control of the Trincomalee Harbour as it will hinder national security”. “Since Trinco Harbour is in a strategic location, we have not requested expressions of interest from anyone”, the Minister said. When asked if it was planned to offer the Trincomalee Port to the Japanese, the US, or India, his response was “No, not at all,”. He added that Japan had given one billion yen, or USD 7.5 million, to install night vision equipment in the port. “We won’t grant access to the Chinese or Indians to meddle with the Trinco Harbour. But in the future, we can think about it as a joint venture.  We are happy to join if they decide to build a terminal similar to the one in the Colombo Port. But navigation control  will always be with us as we are concerned about national security and will not partner with anyone as far as navigation control is concerned,” he said. “It’s in a strategic location. What we said was any investor could come to invest on the land areas of the Trinco Harbour and we will facilitate. This we have officially said,” the Minister underscored. He said as yet no call has been made for a joint venture with anyone to develop the Trinco Harbour. In an interview with Ceylon Today he said the Trincomlaee port was running at a loss but was gradually picking up. “We get about Rs 400 to 500 million annually but this is inadequate and we need to expand,” the Minister said. When asked whether the Government wasn’t looking for an investor run the Trincomalee Port, he said “A joint venture with anyone would be ideal and we are looking forward to it”. The Minister said while they wanted to develop the Trinco Harbour, there was an issue because India, which recently joined the IOC had an ambitious plan to build the British-built oil tank farm near Trinco Harbour. He also said the Board of Investment would also evaluate an investor’s interest in manufacturing Ilmenite value-added products in Trincomalee. “Once the go-ahead is given, we will lease out a portion of the harbour to export illmenite”. The Minister however claimed that no investor has so far been selected. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/04/08/was-arbitration-agreementput-to-cabinet-parliament/,"Was arbitration agreementput to Cabinet, Parliament?",By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2023-04-07T20:30:00+00:00,"The Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) released an expressive statement last week that there were only 43 days (now less than 40 days) left to file a claim, and the Sri Lankan authorities’ decision to file a lawsuit in Singapore instead of Sri Lanka was morally wrong as Singapore is where the X-Press Pearl’s owners are. Ceylon Today reported in October last year on a ‘USD 10B loss: Marine experts call for a Presidential Commission probe’ which didn’t materialise. Last November, President Ranil Wickremesinghe directed Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to file action at the International Court of Arbitration in Singapore (ICAS) to obtain compensation from the owner of the X-Press Pearl vessel and the P&I Club (insurer), when it is unclear on what basis universal jurisdiction is invoked to go to Singapore. The fact that the vessel is not from Singapore is insufficient evidence. The CEJ warned that if proper legal action is not taken against the owners of the X-Press Pearl, which caused a major disaster, polluted the seas, and destroyed marine life that is still not properly assessed, the nation will forfeit USD 10 billion in compensation. Sri Lanka may lose out on claiming compensation for the X-Press Pearl Marine Disaster under local law as legally the claim must be filed within two years of the accident, that is, before 29 May 2023. The X-Press Pearl disaster was a major environmental incident that occurred off the coast of Sri Lanka in May 2021, when the container vessel caught fire and sank, causing a great deal of pollution in the surrounding waters. In June 2021, the Sri Lankan Government made its first compensation claim against X-Press Feeders, owner of X-Press Pearl. It was the interim claim of USD 40 million which was then sent to the Singapore-based container group. “This is only the initial claim,” Chair of the Marine Environment Protection Authority told Shipping Watch. The sum was to cover costs for extinguishing the fire on board X-Press Pearl, damages to fishing in the area as well as clean-up work as of 1 June, informed former DG Dharshani Lahandapura, Chair of the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA). But that compensation was not even claimed since then. The authority failed to obtain a maritime indemnity from the P&I Club, the X-Press Pearl ship owner’s liability insurance, to cover the current losses and any potential future losses, according to marine experts in 2021. Later that same month, in June 2021, X-Press Feeders CEO Shmuel Yoskovitz told Channel News Asia (CNA) in Singapore that the fire that consumed the doomed ship was most likely caused by a leak in one of its containers. He added that the crew of the ship was aware of the leak, but that before the fire started, Qatar and India had refused to allow the container to be unloaded. “It’s challenging to determine the fire’s origin. The ship was loaded with lots of goods. One container was leaking. Although we are not entirely certain, it [was the most likely] cause,” Yoskovitz said. However, Ceylon Today revealed in 2021 that no one had looked into the chemical consignments that came from Iran which was also stocked in the vessel. Singapore was chosen as the venue for the lawsuit because X-Press Feeders is headquartered there and because the City-State has an established legal system that is frequently used for international disputes. However, marine experts question the wisdom of choosing Singapore as the site of the arbitration because the City-State has a questionable track record as an independent centre for arbitration, particularly in delicate situations like this. Because the shipping company for the X-Press Pearl is located in Singapore, there is a conflict of interest, and the Singapore Maritime Administration and Sri Lanka have a lacklustre attitude toward cooperating with one another, a maritime expert who wished to remain anonymous said. As has always been the case for any incident of this nature anywhere in the world, the incident involving the X-Press Pearl occurred in Sri Lanka, where the proper legal forum to enact justice is located. One needs to have an arbitration agreement with the offender in order to choose the arbitration centre. Despite all the disadvantages listed above, it appears that the Sri Lankan Government has decided to use Singapore as its arbitration venue. But the question here is who misled the Cabinet to take the decision to recommend the Cabinet to engage in serious wrongdoing like this? Was the arbitration agreement presented to the Cabinet and Parliament? The Opposition Leader asked these questions repeatedly, but they were always ignored. It is now up to the MEPA and the GoSL to reveal the arbitration deal in Singapore. What conditions are in the agreement? Despite the fact that there is a conflict of interest, why was this forum chosen? What laws are applicable to the arbitration? Why were Sri Lanka and the MEPA Act ignored when legal action was taken are some burning questions the Government should be able to answer. The time limit of less than 40 days that the MEPA and the media have mentioned is in accordance with Sri Lankan law, but if Singaporean law is used to resolve the dispute, it makes no difference. Sri Lanka has the right to choose a neutral venue even if one must choose a foreign arbitration forum; why not Hong Kong? The Government now has a duty to disclose the arbitration agreement, its terms, and the indemnity, comfort, and other letters, as well as the financial limits of those indemnities. The Shanghai Salvage Company (SSC) of China’s Barge Ke Li and De Tian salvage tug, which the P&IClub recently hired, have entered the wreck site of the X-Press Pearl and it was removed. The general assumption in this case was that if the wreck is removed, there will be no chance of further prosecution for any claims."

Wijesekera thanked the Indian Envoy for the support the government and the people of India extended to overcome the economic crisis Sri Lanka was facing and continuing the assistance to date. The Minister said, “We hope to develop the northern and eastern provinces especially Trincomalee Port development, the industrial zone, the energy hub with the assistance of India and also we would be finalising in the next few weeks the long awaited Indo-Sri Lanka power grid connectivity and we hope by next year we can actually start physical work on the grid connectivity development and this would give a strong statement on the India-Sri Lanka friendly relationship”. The Minister also stated that the foundation that has been laid in the last 12 months will open business opportunities to both Indians and Sri Lankans. He thanked LIOC for helping all citizens of Sri Lanka during the fuel crisis. Manoj Gupta,  MD Lanka IOC said as the subject Minister, Wijesekera was effective in providing solutions for smooth operations. High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay said, “The strength of the relationship between India and Sri Lanka lies in their people-to-people ties. The closeness of history, the closeness of geography, our proximity, the shared heritage, the shared history and there is so much that binds us” His Excellency also mentioned that India and Sri Lanka are civilisational twins and that one twin feels the pain when the other is suffering and it is but natural that twins and close neighbours help each other at the time of need.” The commemorative dinner was held at Taj Samudra  on 31 March. President of the Sri Lanka India Society, Kishore Reddy spoke about the activities of the society in promoting cross cultural talent and supporting budding artistes. The SLIS had also organised events to promote tourism, business as well as having continuous projects of helping elders’ homes and supporting the needy. Highlighting on the relationship between the two nations Reddy said, “Trade and investment have grown and there is cooperation in the fields of development, education, culture and in various other fields. Both countries share a broad understanding of major issues of international interest. As a friendship society, we are very happy and equally proud of India’s assistance to Sri Lanka at a time of need and this truly resonates with the phrase “a friend in need is a friend indeed”. He looked back on the assistance provided by the Government of India and thanked Gopal Baglay. He concluded saying, “We wish Sri Lanka and India peace, happiness and prosperity, today and in the future, and to the enduring friendship and partnership between both countries.” Established in 1949, the Sri Lanka India Society is one of the oldest and largest friendship societies in Sri Lanka and to date works in strengthening to build people to people bonds of the two great nations and continue their deep-rooted, centuries-old ties. The Indo-Lanka relationship has been multi-faceted, unwavering and time-tested. Since gaining independence just six months apart, over the years the neighbours have strengthened their relationship in the region whilst the benefits of its synergies have touched the lives of many."

De Visser is also the President and Founder of Sri Lanka Unites (www.srilankaunites.org) and Global Unites (www.globalunites.org), both youth movements for hope and reconciliation. His debut book, ‘Phoenix Generation’ is a compelling advocacy for youth to play a central role in peace building and national transformation. Drawing from historical movements for change, and his fifteen years of experience founding and leading the largest youth movement for peace in the Island, Sri Lanka Unites and one of the fastest-growing global youth movements for peace, in the form of Global Unites, Prashan, through this book, urges his readers to consider the possibility of youth-led conflict transformation and reconciliation. Expressing praise for the book, former American President Barack Obama’s one-time spiritual adviser, Dr. Joel Hunter says, “This book is a must read for anyone who wants to change the world for good. It is written by one of the world’s top young leaders who has created a movement and an incredible global organisation (Global Unites) that will shape our future… Inspirational in its hope, compelling in its stories, and factual in its history, the Phoenix Generation calls us to join young leaders, going into a future of cooperation and fulfilling potential.” Sri Lanka Unites was founded in 2006, prior to the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War, and the movement has grown significantly since then. Today it is supported by nearly 30,000 members, 40 staff, and nine offices across the Island, one in nearly every province, helping it to be actively engaged in all 25 districts of Sri Lanka. In 2015, inspired by Sri Lanka Unites, a worldwide movement called ‘Global Unites’ was born and now acts as an umbrella movement for youth-led reconciliation in 13 countries under Prashan De Visser’s visionary leadership. The launch of ‘Phoenix Generation’ was also an opportunity for De Visser to officially bid farewell to Sri Lanka Unites, as he hands over leadership to a capable younger generation, as his focus now shifts to the expansion of Global Unites – through which he will work to expand the movement and its positive impact – while at home his focus will be on policy transformation and paving the way for a new political culture led by a new generation of Sri Lankan leaders. ‘Phoenix Generation’ by Prashan De Visser is available for sale at leading bookshops in Colombo, Kandy, Galle and Jaffna and online through Kapruka.com – in Sri Lanka – and Amazon.com – worldwide."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/04/01/energy-ministry-sitting-on-oil-exploration-data/,Energy Ministry Sitting On Oil Exploration Data?,Author not found,0,2023-03-31T20:50:00+00:00," The only current geophysical data the Sri Lankan Government has is quickly becoming outdated and the major international geophysical survey companies, that conducted data surveys nine months ago, in the Mannar Cauvery Basin, were unable to recoup their cost, Ceylon Today reliably learns. Sources close to the Energy Ministry indicated that WesternGeco, owned by Schlumberger, the biggest oilfield services company in the world, invested USD 20 million, while Schlumberger and Bell Geospace collectively invested USD 2 to 4 million. The GoSL reportedly made promises to a number of investors, but by that time, former Energy Minister Udaya Gammanpila had been fired. At the time, it was promised to promote exploration and hold bid rounds so that data would be purchased by exploration companies in order to generate revenue. Sitting on data that is worth millions of dollars and which could help Sri Lanka find oil and gas worth billions of dollars, is a serious crime, sources revealed. These international companies have not received payment as a result of numerous government ministers and directors general in the energy sector breaking their promises and neglecting to perform their duties. Two top geophysical survey companies, WesternGeco (Schlumberger, 2018) and Bell Geospace (2021) conducted modern geophysical studies on a multi-client basis (to be reimbursed by exploration investors) based on the Government of Sri Lanka’s assurance that it would conduct bid-rounds and promote upstream activities, but that have not been reimbursed and the exploration investors are waiting until the government finalises the process, although nothing has happened in the last 10 months. According to sources, the survey results have been overwhelmingly positive and have revealed a wealth of new information about the understudied Mannar and Cauvery Basins. Given that millions of dollars worth of data have been lost over the last five years, the company wonders whether geophysical survey companies will continue to take a chance with the GoSL in the future. At a significant Oil and Gas conference in London, Bell Geospace recently presented its extremely encouraging data and analysis on Mannar Basin. The Bellgeo gravity gradiometry results have been very positive. Although the report justified additional testing and drilling in the Mannar Cauvery basin, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, based on the extremely positive results of the gravity gradiometry, gravity, and magnetic survey, the Energy Ministry is sound asleep. Bell Geospace’s 3D Full Tensor Gradiometry, gravity, and magnetic survey were acquired in accordance with the winning bidder’s specifications in the mid-2019 bid round and presented on 9 March 2023, at SEAPEX, a significant industry gathering. “This data provides new insights into the structural and tectonic history of the region, as well as on the hydrocarbon potential, in Cauvery where modern 3D seismic is non-existent and exploration relies on vintage 2D lines,” wrote the paper’s authors Colm Murphy, Michal Ruder, et al. of Bell Geospace and Wintermoon Geotechnologies. Together with ENE and WNW trending fault patterns, they provided evidence of the region’s complex development and insight into the future of these two significant basin areas offshore Sri Lanka, they continued. To buy fuel at current prices, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation alone would need to spend more than USD 3 billion every year if there were no quota restrictions. Sri Lanka actually spends a lot more money on fuel than it should because of its poor credit worthiness. The potential for domestic hydrocarbons is thought to be several billion barrels of oil and nine trillion cubic feet of gas. The Sri Lankan Government could make billions of dollars from this source of income. Cairn India, which investigated the Mannar M2 block, made an investment of USD 200 million in the area ten years ago. The Petroleum Development Authority of Sri Lanka reports that the mid-case GIIP volume estimate for one of the Cairn India discoveries is 1.5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), the high-case estimate is 5 Tcf, and the mid-case recoverable volume is 350bcf. (Billion Cubic Foot). If there is a willingness and desire to listen to industry experts, Sri Lanka can draw an amount of investment in exploration alone that is orders of magnitude greater than USD 200 million. Given the recent rise in energy prices, these are very likely to be economically viable. If Sri Lanka used the gas, without incurring transportation costs, it would undoubtedly be commercially viable, especially with more recent solutions like Gas-To-Wire (GTW). Therefore, Sri Lanka is missing out on potential significant sources of income in addition to missing out on its own fuel and feedstock for power generation. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Documents notifying the man and woman of the decision, which The New Humanitarian has reviewed, say they will not be returned to Sri Lanka, where they fear persecution by the Government. A third country for resettlement has not yet been identified, however. The two asylum seekers, Hamshika Krishnamoorthi, 22, and Ajith Sajithkumar, 22, were among the first 89 Tamil asylum seekers to arrive on Diego Garcia in October 2021. Their boat broke down near the island, and they were rescued by British Forces. The number of Sri Lankan asylum seekers swelled to nearly 200 in 2022, but many either accepted payments from the UK to return to Sri Lanka or voluntarily left by boat to seek asylum on the French island of Réunion. Of the remaining 68 asylum seekers, many say they were tortured and sexually abused by Sri Lankan security forces for alleged links to the LTTE. While more than 50 people have had their asylum claims assessed by UK officials on the island, most have been rejected. Their rejection letters include the line: “A removal order will be issued for your return to Sri Lanka.”  “I am very happy, but at the same time, worried about how much longer it will be,” Krishnamoorthi has said while he was in the Rwanda Military Hospital in Kigali the capital of Rwandan.

Ambassador of Japan Mizukoshi Hideaki, who attended the event, said this year will be the beginning of an economic revival providing a springboard for future development for Sri Lanka. He also mentioned that Japan had been a long-standing partner in Sri Lanka’s socioeconomic development. Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry urged all think-tanks, such as Pathfinder Foundation, to look into areas a typical politician would not comprehend and push for necessary changes. He also reiterated that a politician should have the humility to listen and learn from experts on the subject, encouraging think tanks to engage with the public and share populist policies. The event was organized in collaboration with the International Trade Centre (ITC), Geneva and attended by representatives from several government and private sector agencies. The report has suggested a strategic response to transforming the economy, focusing on four priority sectors in which Indo-Japanese collaboration is sought to put the country on a sustainable growth trajectory for a structural shift. In his welcome remarks, Pathfinder Foundation Chairman Bernard Goonetilleke highlighted that the two countries – India and Japan – were very close development partners of Sri Lanka, who have much to contribute to reviving Sri Lanka’s economy. He added, “India’s interest in the welfare of the country and its people was evident in the granting of generous credit and other facilities amounting to almost four billion US dollars in the recent past to overcome the economic crisis. Likewise, Japan has been a country which had generously provided economic support going back many decades.”.  The 120-page report explains its main thrust and the rationale for sector selection as the key drivers for structural transformation of the economy.

Angel, appointed ambassador-at-large and a presidential envoy by Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa in March 2021, told reporters he would be able to carry large volumes of dirty cash into the country using his diplomatic status. The 44-year-old, who claims to be a Prophet and heads a congregation — the Good News Church — with branches in 15 countries, said he would facilitate a scheme through which unaccounted cash could be exchanged for Zimbabwe’s gold. Recipients of the gold could then sell the precious metal for legitimate money, effectively turning their cash clean. Angel visited Sri Lanka several times in the past and met several top political figures. In 2022, he participated in launching the monument to Christ called Miracle Dome in Sri Lanka with controversial ‘Prophet’ Jerome Fernando. Angel and his business partner Rikki Doolan also claimed that their laundering operations had the approval of Mnangagwa, who has been in power since November 2017, when Zimbabwe’s controversial former leader Robert Mugabe was ousted in a military coup. Angel made the offer during an operation that was part of ‘Gold Mafia’, an investigation into several gold-smuggling gangs in Southern Africa, with Zimbabwe and South Africa as key hubs. The investigation reveals how these gangs have turned Western sanctions meant to target Zimbabwe’s government into an opportunity to smuggle large quantities of gold and launder hundreds of millions of dollars through a complex web of companies and bribes. Al Jazeera reporters, posing as Chinese nationals who were looking to launder large sums of money, were offered several ways to remove all stains of corruption from their dirty cash. Among those mechanisms was the use of Angel’s diplomatic clout. Officially, the pastor-diplomat is tasked with finding investors to come to Zimbabwe. However, Angel made it clear that he was willing to help smuggle gold and launder money. Zimbabwe needs dollars because the country’s own currency has lost its value in international trade due to hyperinflation. A commodity like gold is a good way to earn dollars, but international sanctions imposed on the country make it difficult for the government to export gold because of the additional scrutiny on officials in power. This scenario makes Zimbabwe fertile ground for money launderers who can help the country earn dollars in exchange for gold. Central to Angel’s gold-for-dirty money operations is Henrietta Rushwaya, president of the Zimbabwe Miners Association. Rushwaya, who is also President Mnangagwa’s niece, told Angel and the reporters on a phone call that smuggling 100kg of gold each week would be no problem. The scheme would need an initial investment of USD 10 million of dirty cash into the government’s gold refinery, Fidelity. Of that, USD 5 million would be held in reserve by Fidelity for the duration of the scam, with the rest being used every week to buy gold. Once the gold is bought, another USD 5 million would be brought in to buy more gold until all the money had been laundered into the precious metal — which would then be sold internationally for legitimate, clean cash.

As the administration of justice in any civilised society cannot be effectively implemented without lawyers, the legislature in its wisdom, through the Judicature Act, established the legal profession. Thus, there is no dispute that the legal profession is a sine qua non for the due administration of justice in this country and for that matter in any civilised society. The said profession is essential for the maintenance of the Rule of Law and maintenance of law and order and its due existence is of paramount importance to the organised functioning of the society which is primarily the basis for the smooth functioning of the country as a whole. Further, Section 41 of the Judicature Act, which has clearly set out the right of representation, and, has further shed light on the above mechanism established for implementing the administration of justice in the country.

HRCSL had issued summons on Thursday (23) to the two Secretaries who have been named as respondents and asked them to appear before the Commission on 6 April at 11.30 a.m. The petition was filed by Dr. Sanjeewa through a lawyer. The Commission would conduct an investigation regarding the circulars issued by the two Ministry Secretaries. Dr. Sanjeewa, in his complaint pointed out the State officials had the right to express opinions for the good of the State, but that the circulars of the two Secretaries, of the two ministries, had violated the right of a government official to criticise the government and thereby it only served to prejudice the tax-paying public of the country. The MCPA Chairman observed that the move by the HRCSL to finally initiate an investigation into the related complaint and will be a victory for the citizens and the trade unionists that represent the people of the island.

Empathy is a set of skills that is hard to find, hard to master, and hard to use. That is why we need to teach it and learn it.” —Mimi Nicklin In fact, ‘empathy’ is not among those set of words that we get to hear in our daily life. It is rather less-spoken about, given less significance, and even neglected. Nevertheless, the best-selling author of the book Softening The Edge, Mimi Nicklin believes that empathy is the golden key to change our perspectives, to change people, society and perhaps the whole world. Recently, Ceylon Today had the opportunity of exchanging ideas with Mimi regarding ‘empathy.’ Mimi Nicklin “Who is Mimi Nicklin?”, is a fair question that you may raise, unless you are familiar with the book, Softening The Edge, or a listener of the breakfast show, Empathy for Breakfast, which are in fact super hits. She is also a well-experienced communications specialist, a largely known empathetic leader, and a cooperate empathy trainer who works with numerous large companies. “Who am I? I am an author and a CEO. I look after organisational empathy. So, I spend my time doing consulting, training, and working across the cooperate world on how to understand each other. Why do we need to understand others, how to communicate, collaborate, and work as a team, and create wellness? These are the questions I give answers for,” shared Nicklin herself. “I just teach people how to balance humanism with capitalism!” Hear them, that’s all! “We are living in times where things are rapidly shifting and changing. Now we don’t have the typical employee types anymore, they are demanding more. They are demanding for dignity, their rights and respect. This is called the employee revolution,” said Nicklin. “The present work environment is complex than ever; it comprises four generations. These generations think different, they communicate different, and they work different. But at the end of the day, we are all parts of a big entity. That is why we should try to understand each other. “Of course, that’s where empathy gets to play the role. As I said, it is not an emotion, but a set of skills that we need to master to understand others. The first and the crucial thing to it is listening to people. Everyone has got a story and they want those to be heard. So, when you just hear them, you just get to realise their situations, and their mindsets, which enable you to understand them,” Nicklin furthered. She took on to explain that empathy doesn’t necessarily demand you to act. You just have to listen to them and understand them. That’s it. In fact, you can’t afford to find solutions for everyone’s problems. “It would tire and wear you out if you always had to act upon listening to others. Empathy is not like that. Even the feeling that theirs is someone to listen to them, would make your employees, or colleagues or friends feel better,” she shared. It is the key to unity “You know, there are so many gaps in our society which are separating us. They are resulted by stereotypes, prejudices, misunderstandings, and so on. But the question is why? Again, because we don’t empathise with the others; we don’t try to understand them,” furthered Nicklin. “The answer to this also is listening. Once you listen to the others and understand them, there will be no barriers that would prevent you from embracing the other genuinely, and firmly.” Mimi getting into empathy “In 2018 I moved to the Middle East to take over business. It was not as smooth as I expected. I was thrown from the cooperate world to the entrepreneurial world. It was a very overwhelming time. There were problems which I didn’t know how to address. But I did know if I put my people – employees, suppliers, stake holders, directors, and so on – first, since humans are amazing together, we could do anything. That I knew instinctively. At least, I thought I was using my intuition, until one day I was having lunch with my business coach while sharing what was happening. The she said to me, “Are you using Empathy?”, and I was like “What, no. What is empathy!” Mimi shared how she was introduced to the concept of empathy. “However, after my confrontation with the business coach, I started researching on empathy and how it works on people. I came to know about this ‘empathy deficit’ – a phrase coined by President Barak Obama. He said that we were all talking about economic deficit, but we have to focus on the empathy deficit as well,” she said. “It was about ‘6’ before, nonetheless no action was happening in that regard. Therefore, I thought to set on to fill this gap of empathy in our society.” After numerous years of research and working in the field, Nicklin then decided to publish a book on what she gathered about empathy, which came out during the pandemic, with the title, Softening The Edge. “I wasn’t sure if the people would embrace it because still there wasn’t much talk about empathy; people didn’t know about it. Then, the American presidential elections took place, and when Joe Biden won, he had two words in his campaign. One was ‘unity’ and the other was ‘empathy’. So suddenly, the world started to talk about empathy. Every TV screen was displaying the word,” Nicklin reminisced how unexpected it was. “This hustle had enormous popularity to my book, that it became a worldwide bestseller.” Moving further “During the lockdown, when I was at home, I started my debut podcast, titled, Empathy for Breakfast. It also attracted much audience – another surprise – and featured 85,000 people on my show. I did it being at home. I am happy that now we have created a dialogue about empathy. Unlike earlier, now if you google, you get so many fields engaging empathy. That’s really great, I believe,” Nicklin said.  Now, after three years since she launched her first book, Nicklin is now ready to launch her new book, of which the title is not revealed yet, but she has launched a second podcast called MIMI YOU YOU. “Actually, this second podcast is designed to allow people share their stories, anonymously, with the world. There are so many around the world with untold stories out of fear, and hesitance. My ambition is to create a platform where anyone can share their story, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, and so on safely and confidently,” added Nicklin. So, if you have an untold story or if you know someone else with a story which you believe that the world must hear, reach out to Nicklin through her social media. She is ready to make your stories heard.  By Induwara Athapattu"

Issuing a statement, the ADIC pointed out that taking action to control alcohol is always advantageous for a country, while it provides disadvantages for the alcohol industry. “A study, conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), Sri Lanka, the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) and the Ministry of Health, revealed that the excise revenue received in 2015 was Rs 105 billion, while the health and economic loss incurred by the government due to alcohol consumption in the same year was Rs 119 billion. Therefore, these findings emphasise the fact that considering only the excise duty with regard to government revenue is a narrow economic vision in terms of economic development, but rather, considering the economic loss due to alcohol use is more effective. This method is currently used in developed countries and these countries focus on gradually reducing alcohol usage in the country, while introducing correct alcohol taxation systems,” the statement said. Furthermore, in the year 2022, the alcohol industry increased the prices of their products, giving the reason as increased production costs. The government did not establish policies to increase excise tax in parallel with the price increase in alcohol products, which led to a large revenue loss from excise duty to the government, the ADIC said. “From the last Budget, the government decided to increase the excise duty on alcohol by 20% from the initial amount. At present, it is clear that the intention of this decision, which was to increase the government revenue and discourage alcohol use among individuals, is gradually being achieved. Hence, the Excise Department should focus entirely on taking necessary steps to increase excise duty and collaborate with the Sri Lankan Police, to control and act against the illicit alcohol industry instead of increasing the profits of the alcohol companies,” the ADIC said.

G. A. Chandrasiri said. Accordingly, these new x-ray machines will be brought in before May 2023. “We are preparing to receive the latest systems deployed around the world, as the current machines are outdated. All of our X-ray machines are out-of-date and international requirements should be maintained,” he said Meanwhile, the AASL is in the process of installing four e-gates, at a cost of Rs 600 million and has, through a tender process, selected the contractor to install them at the BIA by the end of this year. “We are about to sign the agreement with the contractor and by the end of 2023, we will have e-gates installed too and we have already selected the contractor. We also had discussions with them last week and about to sign the agreement for the e-gates. As soon as the agreement is signed these gates will be installed within six months. The e-gate facilities are really going to help us as when there is congestion like we are experiencing now, passengers will quickly move out or move in. We are getting ready as an influx of passengers is expected in the coming months.” The four gates would be initially installed at the arrivals and at the departures sections, each getting two. He also said that the meantime the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has agreed to give another 10 e-gates as a grant. “Our aim is to receive identical ones from the IOM so it would coordinate well with the four e-gates we are going to install,” he added. The responsibility of the e-gates lies with the immigration department, although AASL is funding them. The IOM will install the e-gates at the BIA, he added. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The case will be taken up before a five-Judge Bench as determined by the Court on Tuesday (14). The Court of Appeal two-Judge-Bench comprising Justices Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and M.A.R. Marikkar on Tuesday (14), appointed a five-Judge Bench after considering a motion filed on behalf of Rev. Father Cyril Gamini, seeking a fuller Appellate Court Bench to hear the Petition filed by Sirisena. Further, Court also ordered the Fort Magistrate to stay proceedings in the private plaint filed against Sirisena, until the final determination of the Writ Application. A Private Plaint was filed by Rev. Father Cyril Gamini and a victim of the Easter Sunday attack Jesudasan Nadesan, before the Fort Magistrate, on 16 September 2022, alleging that Sirisena had failed to order the arrest of Zaharan Hashim and his followers, to oversee their arrest, to prevent the murder of those who do not profess the Islamic faith, thus resulting in omissions in terms of the Penal Code. Oral submissions were made on behalf of the complainants and the Fort Magistrate made an order issuing summons on Sirisena, requiring him to be present before the Fort Magistrate’s Court on 14 October 2022. Sirisena, through the Writ Application, observed that the Magistrate has failed to exercise his discretion properly in deciding to issue summons and has erred in law in acting upon hearsay. It was noted that the Magistrate has acted on inadmissible material and that the complainants have wilfully misrepresented facts and as such, the Fort Magistrate has misdirected himself on the material facts and that complainants have wilfully suppressed material facts, mainly that there was a State Minster of Defence overlooking the Department of the Police and the Armed Forces and Intelligence agencies during the relevant period.

Commission member Dr. Vijitha Nanayakkara said, the news reports on summoning Public Security Minister Alles on Monday (13), is in fact wrong and steps will be taken to call an explanation from the media Spokesman, on what grounds he issued a Media statement to that effect, despite four members of the HRCSL being unaware of it. While emphasising that the Commission has not met after 28 February, he also noted that other Commission members got to know about the decision to summon the Minister only through media reports. Meanwhile, Commissioner Dr. Nimal Karunasiri alleged that even though all five members should be aware of any statement issued by the HRCSL, only the Chairperson appears to be aware of the media statement issued about summons sent to the Minister. “This is not about whether the decision to summon the Minister is correct or not. This is about the Commission not taking such a decision at all,” he added. Another HRCSL member Ven. Kalupahane Piyananda Thera noted that he was completely unaware of the decision to summon the Minister as he has been in Thailand these past few days.

The Russians have already held three rounds of negotiations via video conference on various topics such as ammonia and nuclear energy cyclotron with the Sri Lankan officials. The Sri Lankan Government acknowledged, in response to the Russian proposal, that it had completed the necessary paperwork and had plans to build either onshore or offshore Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) with a maximum power capacity of 100 MW each."

He challenged the process by which the PUCSL has purportedly approved the electricity tariff hike proposed by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) contrary to established legal procedures. The primary basis of the action is that approval of the PUCSL is a necessary requirement for a change in tariffs and that there was no such lawful approval of the Commission given to the proposal. It was stated thereby that the purported approval given by the Commission is an unlawful decision of three of the Members and not a decision of the Commission. Ratnayake further stated that the PUCSL is duty-bound to ensure that the interests of all citizens are met when approving a change in tariffs and that a tariff that disproportionately affects those within lower usage brackets would put those at the lowest income levels at risk of ‘de-electrification,’ making even the limited units of electricity consumed by them for basic necessities inaccessible. Further, it was observed that most economically generated hydropower-based electricity alone would be more than sufficient to service all domestic consumers within the 0-30, 31-60 and 61-90 bands, with a significant portion of such electricity remaining for distribution among other categories, adding that thus, it is unreasonable that consumers within these brackets are made to pay the price of electricity generated at a much higher cost.

Speaking at the Ministerial Consultative Committee held in Parliament the Minister pointed out that due to the existing financial issues, there was a shortage of equipment to provide new connections. However, with the recent steps to increase the electricity tariffs, the strengthening of the financial sector of the board would enable new connections to be provided. The Minister made this remark when the committee members raised concerns that despite a large number of people having registered to get new connections, there is a big delay in issuing connections. Also, the minister said that a programme to minimise the cost of the institutions under the ministry, including the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), is currently underway. Wijesekara also pointed out that by changing the QR code fuel quota update to Tuesday, overtime expenses of nearly Rs 20 million to be paid to petroleum workers on weekends can be saved. Also the Minister said, no new employees will be recruited to these institutions and the expenses have been reduced as much as possible through the management of the currently employed staff. Speaking further, the Minister said that smart metering is expected to be introduced soon and arrangements have been made to start the pilot project in the Dehiwala – Mount Lavinia Municipal Council limits.

Fielding questions, he said the Government could not avoid holding elections by claiming that there are no funds. “Funds would be allocated to pay the salaries of MPs and to purchase food for Parliament. Knowing that an election was at hand, funds have been allocated from the Budget for the Local Government Election 2023 as well,” he pointed out.   Speaking further, Fr.

Hapuhinna’s letter, issued on 10 January sparked controversy in the country and many political parties severely criticised the move alleging that, it was a political gimmick of the Government to avoid holding an election. After Hapuhinna’s letter to the District Returning Officers, the EC on the same day sent a letter to them noting that it is the duty of the District Secretaries to accept the deposits from candidates. Hapuhinna has no authority to send such letters to the District Secretaries, the EC said. Hapuhinna withdrew the letter on the next day (11 January). When summoned by the EC Hapuhinna had told that he issued the letter following the directives of Cabinet. However, Prime Minister Dinesh Guanwardena, who holds the ministerial portfolio of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government, vouched in Parliament on 17 January that the Cabinet never took any decision to halt accepting deposits. In response to a question raised by Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake last week, the PM said the Cabinet did not take such a decision and if someone claims so, it is completely false.

Following a lengthy submission by all parties, Court issued the said interim order whilst the Petition was fixed to be taken up on 26 May under Article 12(1) and Article 14(1) (a) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court also issued another interim order preventing the Government Printer from the retention of the funds reserved for the printing of ballot papers. This was when the Fundamental Rights Petition, filed by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Ranjith Maddumabandara, against the failure to provide funds to hold the LG Election in March 2023, was taken before a Supreme Court three-Judge-Bench comprising Justices Janak de Silva, Preethi Padman Surasena, and Priyantha Fernando. Making submissions, on behalf of the Petitioner, President’s Counsel Upul Jayasuriya noted that if the LG Election is not held, there will be no democracy and it would result in a dictatorship. He further noted that the Supreme Court is vested with the power to safeguard the franchise and sovereignty of people. He also observed that the franchise pertaining to Local Authorities comes within the purview of the franchise guaranteed by Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution and that the right to a free, equal and secret ballot embodying the right of franchise is an integral part of the citizen’s freedom of expression recognised by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, especially in view of Sri Lanka’s obligations under Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 27(15) of the Constitution. Further, it was observed that such an effort by the Minister of Finance would plunge Sri Lanka into a pariah State looked down by all the civilized States, jeopardising the ailing economy of the country into an irreparable irreversible state and a point of no return. Jayasuriya said, whilst the LG Election was due to be held on 19 March 2022, it was lawfully extended by the Minister-in-Charge, who is empowered to only so extend it for an year and thereby, such period expires on 19 March 2023. He also stated that if the LG Election is postponed for the needs of certain officials including the Secretary to the Treasury, the Election Commission will be made powerless. He further noted that according to Article 104G of the Constitution, all public officers performing duties and functions at any election or Referenda shall act in the performance and discharge of such duties and functions under the directions of the Commission and shall be responsible and answerable to the Commission therefor. He added that public officers, deployed in relation to the LG Election- related activity, owe a Constitutional duty, adding however, that the purpose of the instant application is not to prosecute public officers but to ensure the required funds are released to conduct the Election. Meanwhile, Additional Solicitor General President’s Counsel Priyantha Nawana, appearing on behalf of the Secretary to the Treasury and the Attorney General, noted that postponing the LG Election by a stipulated time does not construe cancellation and thereby it does not amount to a violation of fundamental rights. He further noted that the country is currently plunged in an economic crisis and shortage of funds and on top of that, the country has to fulfil International obligations of repaying debts. ASG Nawana further observed that the State never intended to deny Fundamental Rights and Sovereignty enshrined in the Constitution, while adding that as the instant application is in regard to the need to release funds for the holding of the Election, the Election Commission should issue a statement in this regard.  He further observed that this is an exceptional circumstance in which the policies of the State itself could not be fulfilled. It was also stated that the Secretary to the Treasury has not obstructed the LG Election process and has taken steps to release Rs 100 million to the Election Commission, Rs 40 million to the Government Press and Rs 25 million to the Sri Lanka Police. Further, President’s Counsel Saliya Peiris, appearing on behalf of the Election Commission, noted that the Secretary to the Treasury has stated that the LG Election has not been classified as essential activity in order to release funds, whilst noting that the Minister of Finance cannot make such decision. Following a lengthy submission by all parties, Court issued the said interim order whilst the Petition was fixed to be taken up on 26 May under Article 12(1) and Article 14(1) (a) of the Constitution. It was noted in the Petition that the failure to provide funds for the Local Government Election, notwithstanding the fact that an estimated sum of Rs 10 billion has been allocated to the Election Commission, for conducting elections, other than parliamentary elections, under the Activity Budget Estimates for the fiscal year of 2023 and/or Budget for the year 2023 is a violation of Fundamental Rights. It was also stated that the Minister of Finance has no mandate by the people of Sri Lanka to act in such a dictatorial manner disregarding democratic values that are enshrined in the Constitution. When the case was taken up on 28 February, Additional Solicitor General Nerin Pulle requested Court to fix the case for 11 May together with a Petition filed in regard to the LG Election, but Jayasuriya requested for it to be fixed on an earlier date before 9 March, which was when the Local Government Election was initially due to be held, considering it a matter of urgency and thereby it was fixed for yesterday (3). President’s Counsel Upul Jayasuriya with Sandamal Rajapaksha, Nisala Fernando, Sachitha Andrahennadi, Instructed by Sampath Wijewardena appeared on behalf of the Petitioner.  BY Faadhila Thassim"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/03/04/govt-to-consult-india-before-signing-agreement-with-russia/,Govt to consult India before signing agreement with Russia,Author not found,0,2023-03-03T20:30:00+00:00," Sri Lanka is considering selecting one of three locations – Trincomalee, Hambantota, or Mannar  for the proposed Russian mini nuclear power plant and the Sri Lankan Government intends to consult India before signing an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with Russia. Regarding the funding of the project, the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board (SLAEB) is of the view that the government ‘may’ go for fully Russian-funded nuclear plants or look for other options like a joint-venture. Chairman of the SLAEB Prof S. R. D. Rosa, told Ceylon Today on Friday (3) that the Government has expressed its willingness to proceed with the two mini nuclear power plants project as a joint venture, and they intend to hold further discussions about the installation and the relevant factors. Russia proposed a mini nuclear power plant for Sri Lanka several years ago, but due to the energy crisis the Government revived talks with Russia. The SLAEB will consult India and select the model similar to the one Russia is installing in Bangladesh with India. India has joint in construction and installation works in the “non-critical” category for the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant in Bangladesh, Rosatom State Corporation of Russia said.  Russia also built the Kundankulam Nuclear Power plant in South India that was commissioned in the year 2013. The SLAEB Chairman said they will still earmark the nuclear project if it’s an onshore project to be installed either in Mannar, Trincomalee or Hambantota. He added that whether the proposed nuke plants are offshore on barrages or offshore would be discussed before the agreement is signed and they expect to do it soon. The Russian Ambassador to Sri Lanka said recently they had already held three rounds of video conferences on various topics such as ammonia and nuclear energy cyclotron with the Sri Lankan officials, for the proposed Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), with a maximum power capacity of 100 MW each. “The response should also include an invitation for a high-ranking Rosatom delegation to visit Sri Lanka for expert-level consultations, the Envoy said on Friday (3). He emphasised as a first step towards installation of the nuke power plant, the Cabinet had  approved the signing of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) recommended  by the  Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage.   He added that once that is approved it would be directed to the Cabinet for the next step of getting the IGA approved through the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Energy with Russia. The Chairman added that the IAEA has already approved the installation of nuclear power plant. The proposed Russian for nuclear power plant was initiated a long time ago and the planned MoU with them in 2018 really did not take off well, the SLAEB Chairman said.  Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), in its report said that given India’s lack of experience in developing projects outside of India and its long history of nuclear cooperation with Russia, Russia may expect to participate in joint projects with India in third world countries.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

President of the MCPA, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa said on Friday (24), that the free health system of Sri Lanka, which has been of a superior quality, was now faced with many challenges – specially in the continuation of free health due to arbitrary decisions taken by various politicians and bureaucrats. Therefore, the Ministry of Health and hospital administrators should conduct a proper survey regarding this situation and analyse as to whether there had been a marked increase in deaths of those admitted to hospitals when compared with the past number of years. It is obvious that in addition to the essential drugs even non-essential medicines, which were needed to continue providing daily health care services, were in shortage.  Drugs such as Paracetamol, antibiotics, insulin, cholesterol, high blood pressure, kidney disease, cancer, liver disease medication, and even those which should be taken for fever and common cold were in shortage, he alleged.  Dr. Sanjeewa said, those patients with long term chronic diseases and non-communicable diseases visited their medical practitioner but failed to obtain the medicines due to the prevailing shortage and the high cost of medicines aggravating their health conditions even further. Those suffering from heart disease diabetes and high blood pressure suffered complications of the diseases as a result of the above mentioned reasons, he alleged.  Currently there is also a risk of the primary health care services collapsing while, some community programmes, implemented at the level of the Medical Officer Health (MoH) Office, to prevent diseases, have been disrupted. The recent fuel and electricity crisis, the quality of medicines and steps to measure the health conditions of patients have collapsed in the country, the MCPA President lamented. As a result of the economic situation, the general public were also suffering from acute stress increasing the possibilities of mental and physical health issues leading to their deaths, he explained.

According to Presidential Secretariat, Rs 1.8 million of the Itukama fund was spent to settle bills accrued by the Health Ministry. However, in response to RTI request sent on 24 January, the Health Ministry said, it did not receive such money from the Itukama Fund. When contacted, the Chief Finance Officer (CFO) of the Presidential Secretariat, who was the Secretary of the fund, refused to speak on any matter related to the fund and requested to submit another RTI request. . The Health Ministry received only Rs. 151.6 million from the Itukama Fund in five installments to spend on three activities, CFO (I) of the Ministry, D.C.  Wickramasena said. This was the seven per cent of the total donation in the fund. Earlier, the Presidential Secretariat said, Rs 41.5 million of the fund was spent for the National Vaccination Programme. But, the Health Ministry said, in the RTI reply that only Rs 40.7 million spent by Department of Government Printers for printing Covid-19 related stationary. The Health Ministry still has a balance of Rs 806,529.15. Also, the Health Ministry spent six million rupees on the Medical Research Institute, Rs 2.5 million on Jaffna University through University Grant Commission (UGC) and Rs 34.1 million on Medical Supply division for PCR tests. Meanwhile, Rs 67.5 million of the fund was spent by Health Ministry for advocacy the programme. From this, Rs 24.3 million was given to a private advertising agency for a social media marketing campaign for ‘towards a new normal’ from July to September of 2020. The final report of the Health Ministry Consultation Procurement Committee said, this advertising company quoted the lowest price, among three bids. But Rs 1.8 million was paid by Ministry of Health as a tax for this project. Also, the Health Ministry paid Rs 43.1 million to another advertising agency to conduct the advertisement placement of the social media marketing campaign ‘Towards a New Normal’ on TV, radio, newspapers and digital media for six weeks from 29 September 2020 to 10 November 2020. The final report of the Health Ministry Consultation Procurement Committee said, the amount paid to this second advertising agency was lower than the total amount of the contract as specified by ministry which was Rs 43.2 million Also, the Presidential Secretariat spent Rs 88,800 for auditing the accounts of the fund which done by the National Audit Office (NAO). NAO sai, many decisions taken by the management committee of this fund were not implemented, such as Rs 408.43 million for purchasing 60 ambulances for the 1990 – Suvasariya Ambulance Service and educational scholarships for children who lost their parents due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The audit report mentioned that the parliamentary approval for this fund, which was established on 16 April 2020, should have be obtained within one year from that date. However, the approval was not received even by 18 July 2022, which was the date of audit. Because of this, the fund was not eligible to get tax exemptions for the donations by 30 November 2021. According to the NAO report, the management committee has not received sufficient project proposals to utilise the funds. Due to that the funds have been deposited in fixed deposits of seven days, 31 days, three months, six months and one year in order to increase the financial assets of the fund. By Rifthi Ali"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/02/25/top-indonesian-coal-bidder-forced-to-withdraw/,Top Indonesian coal bidder forced to withdraw?,Author not found,0,2023-02-24T20:50:00+00:00," On the coal purchasing procurement, the Indonesian coal supplier PT Arista Mitra Jaya, that won the contract, was terminated despite the Ministry of Energy having erred by quoting one of the clauses in the Letter of Credit (LC) that should have been omitted, based on the conditions agreed upon. Arista Mitra Jaya offered 200 days of credit without any interest charge and at the lowest price. It was clause 8, which had been agreed on to be removed from the final LC, by the Lanka Coal Company Pvt. Ltd (LCC) but it was not removed. Hence, the Indonesian bank has rejected the LC. The Indonesian company informed the local bank to rectify the mistake and assured that once this is cleared, they would proceed with the supply process. Also, Ceylon Today reliably learns that the Ministry of Energy and the Foreign Ministry even conducted the Due Diligence Process before approving the Indonesian supplier which is something the Ministry of Energy has not conducted with the other coal suppliers in the past. It is learnt that officials from the Sri Lankan Embassy in Indonesia had visited Arista Mitra Jaya on 6 February 2023, before endorsing the order. The Indonesian party had spent on their travel and food on that particular day. The Indonesian company had entertained the officials from the Sri Lanka Embassy in Indonesia, Heshani Kaushalya, Second Secretary, and Ahmed Falahuddin. The Government also said that PT. Arista Mitra Jaya should take full responsibility to deliver Coal to Sri Lanka, as per the Agreement. Arista Mithra Jaya is a well-established company in Indonesia, which has direct access to over 50 Coal mines through a well organised Cooperative Society. Having erred on its side, the Ministry of Energy blamed Arista Mitra Jaya for ‘delay’ and terminated their procurement order and went on to pick the next highest-bidder to supply coal. It was speculated from the initial step Arista Mitra  the newcomer in business with Sri Lanka, was targeted to be dropped by certain parties with vested interests. Further, the Indonesian company has not been silent or have they delayed, but they have been trying to sort out the LC issue with both the local bank and international banks in Indonesia and Malaysia after their primary bank, Mandiri Bank rejected it due to the local bank stopping correspondence despite many attempts by the Mandiri Bank via phone calls and SWIFT. It has been uncovered that the most recent Cabinet Paper failed to explain how or why the Mandiri Bank in Indonesia turned down the Letter of Credit (LC), which was intended for the purchase of coal for Sri Lanka. The Ministry of Power and LCC have requested the Cabinet to award the tender to two other parties without disclosing their terms and conditions or providing a justification and without taking the necessary corrective action. The Cabinet Memorandum No. 09/2023/PE, of the Ministry of Power and Energy states that the procurement of coal for the Norochcholai Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant (LVPP), by calling for proposals from prospective suppliers and Government to Government (GoG) basis, with credit facilities, considering the urgent and exceptional circumstances. However, with the current unfair treatment and violation of both the SPA and the LC despite the notifications to amend, it is obvious that there is an organised white-collar mafia in action to discourage, disappoint and deactivate these kind of new players entering the Sri Lanka market for the supply of high value, high volume, and highly essential goods and services in order to continue and preserve their corrupt practices. It was said that even Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe resigned from the Special Cabinet Subcommittee appointed to look into the Coal tender issues, in protest due to the lack of confidence in the Lanka Coal Company and the technical committees are one of the best examples. With the participation of Arista Mithra Jaya, in the Coal supply tender, this country and its people managed to secure a better deal and a more feasible offer, which otherwise would have gone to another at a higher value and many unfavorable terms.

Ceylon Today learns that it may not be possible to hold the election, as planned, owing to the stance of the Treasury and that the final decision is in the hands of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is the Finance Minister. Meanwhile, according to top Government officials, the election is unlikely to be held before November. This is because of the circular issued to limit the Government expenditure, amidst the economic crisis and to release funds only for essential services. There is no mention about elections in that circular. The Election Commission (EC) officially announced that the postal voting for the LG Poll, which was scheduled for 22, 23, 24 and 28 February, would be postponed due to the Government Printer’s refusal to print ballot papers until due payment is made. In that backdrop, the Finance Ministry Secretary, who met the EC on Friday (17), informed the commission about difficulties to release the funds for the election due to the current crisis in the country. Speaking to Ceylon Today, EC Chairman Nimal Punchihewa said, when queried about the time frame in which funds could be possibly released, the Finance Ministry officials had said it has to be further discussed. “The Finance Ministry officials said, to release funds for institutions that are not in the essential category, the approval of the President must be obtained. If they cannot release the funds, it means that we will not be able to hold the election,” Punchihewa said. Meanwhile, Government Printer Gangani Liyanage asserted she does not act under the influence of anyone. In a statement, Liyanage said letters have been sent to the EC for advance payments on two occasions. However, by 1 February 2023, only Rs 40 million had been received by the department. The department has requested the Finance Ministry to provide funds and instructions for election printing activities on 13 February, in writing. However, the ministry has not responded to the letter to date, she added.  She said, 75 per cent of printing activities related to postal voting ballot papers has been completed at the moment and to carry out other activities they need Police protection.  Liyanage noted that requests have been sent to the Police in this regard.  She said, if the authorities provide funds and provide necessary protection for the printing activities,the department can complete printing ballot papers for the postal voting within 5 days.  BY Tharaka Samman and J.T. de Silva"

While the Ministry of Defence said, Prabhakaran was cremated in Mullaitivu and his ashes were scattered in the nearby sea in response to Tamil Nadu politician Pazha Nedumaran’s assertion of LTTE leader being in good health and ready to comeback with his plans for the Eelam, the Ministry of Defence said, they do not possess a copy of either the DNA report or the death certificate. Nedumaran and his associates assert that Prabhakaran is still alive and the announcement was made with the consent of his family. He charged that his death certificate and DNA test report were “not officially” given to India and India did not publicly declare it to be true. When Ceylon Today enquired, the MoD Spokesman claimed both the death certificate and the DNA report had been issued, but they did not have a copy of the DNA report and needed time to find the death certificate. There was no confirmation what was written on the death certificate as Nedumaran faction claims that the death certificate notes he is ‘presumed dead’. Ceylon Today asked the Foreign Affairs Ministry if they had issued such documents to India and if they still had a copy of those. However, the response was that they ‘need some time’ to obtain the information and they needed to identify the ‘specific person’ who might be aware of it. According to Rear Admiral (Retired) MP Sarath Weerasekara, the DNA test was done on the body of Prabhakaran’s son Charles Anthony, who was killed in the last stage of the war. “Although I am not the Defence Ministry’s Spokesperson, all I can say is Nedumaran is a joker,” he said, while citing a Indian Express November 2009 report about the GoSL giving the Indian Government Prabhakaran’s DNA test results. Charles Anthony, Pottu Amman, and Soosai were also killed, he added while noting that Karuna Amman and Douglas Devananda both confirmed his death, and that there has been no further explanation. Nedumaran asserts that the document is still unclassified even though all of these details have been reported by various news organisations in India because the government has not made a public announcement regarding them.  Prabhakran’s body was traced around the same time on 18 May in a stretch of land between the Nandikadal Lagoon and the sea. Prabhakaran’s death was widely reported in the media and supported by numerous sources, including the Sri Lankan military and government, who all appeared on numerous international news outlets. Following Nedumaran’s claim several zoom conferences hosted by media houses in Tamil Nadu are being held and uploaded on the YouTube where some of the former LTTE combatants claimed that Prabhakaran is dead.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed his officials and all parties concerned to make this the last time which Sri Lanka imports eggs to the country. A senior spokesman for the Ministry on Friday (17) said, the Department of Animal Production and Health granted permission to import eggs only for bakery confectionaries. Accordingly the imported eggs from India should be handled with care as instructed by the Department. He said, the Minister called for the officials to prepare guidelines for the manner in which the eggs should be handled by the bakery industry, in order to protect the local poultry industry from contracting the Avian Influenza. Not only should bakery employees wear gloves while handling the eggs and dispose them with care, they should also ensure that the remaining shells too, were destroyed accordingly. He said, the bakeries would also be instructed to take stringent precautionary measures to prevent their own employees from taking eggs home or stealing them. Utmost care should be taken to prevent contamination of local poultry. The spokesman said, the imported eggs would not be retailed in the market to consumers. The senior spokesman, quoting Minister Amaraweera, said he observed that Sri Lanka should make use of her standing as the only country in Asia sans Avian influenza to enable the export of chicken and eggs. Although Sri Lanka had experienced a severe shortage of eggs in December 2022, due to drop in production as a result of production cost increases, he noted that measures have been taken to boost it with the increase of parent chicks so that the country could move towards becoming self-sufficient in eggs and chicken once more.

MEPA appointed the expert advisory panel, in view of the impending expiration of the prescription period of two years from the date of the MV X-Pearl incident and the paramount importance of speedy action on 23 January 2023.  The board of directors of MEPA, unanimously resolved to appoint the expert legal advisory panel to obtain views with regard to the specific matters, such as considering the prescription period and giving their opinion on the possible and probable repercussions caused by any delay in filing suitable action, whether a letter of demand should be sent to the ship owners, whether the MEPA needs to submit a claim to the insurance company, whether it is better suited to file action in Sri Lanka than in Singapore or both countries and the best possible approach and counsel to appear on behalf of MEPA. The two experts in the field of Law and Maritime Law include President’s Counsel Roland Perera PC and Dr. Dan Malika Gunasekera. The X-Press Pearl, which sank in Sri Lanka waters, caused critical marine disaster resulting from the inferno aboard the vessel and it caused not only massive damage to the coastal and marine environment  of the island, but also severe adverse socio-economic consequences. As per Section 50 of the Marine Pollution Act No. 35 of 208, the prosecution of a criminal matter should be carried out by the official of the Attorney General and all cases should be filed in the High Court, as per Section 48, subsequent to the fire onboard the ship incident which occurred on or about 20 May 2021.

The  MEPA was informed that the criminal matter is handled by DSG Madhawa Thennakoon and the Civil Case is handled by ASG Vikum de Abrew. However, MEPA said, there is no express provision to retain counsel for the civil matter to obtain damages and so, the MEPA sought the advice of the Attorney General in this regard and MEPA had been informed verbally that the Attorney General, in collaboration with the Ministry of Justice, has obtained approval of the Cabinet to file civil action in Singapore.

This was when the Application was taken before Court of Appeal Justices Sobitha Rajakaruna and Dhammika Ganepola. Court held that CEB is not competent within the available resources to procure fuel from Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and that Court has been informed that CPC has no means to assist the process of providing fuel without accepting payments for the purpose of supplying electricity uninterruptedly during the A/L Examination. The two-Judge Bench also observed that according to the submissions made to Court, the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka also has no capacity to release extra water in order to facilitate such process. Further, the interim relief sought by the PUCSL was also rejected on the basis that the issuance of an interim order would cause irreparable damages to the CEB and eventually, majority of the public including the students who are sitting for the A/L Examination will have to be in dark for several months in the near future. It was also held that the cost of litigation in respect of the Petition should not be borne out of the funds allocated by the Treasury to the PUCSL. BY Faadhila Thassim"

This was when the case was taken up before Supreme Court Justices E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, Kumudini Wickremasinghe and A.L. Shiran Gooneratne. The HRCSL observed that the said authorities have failed to abide by the settlement arrived at before the Commission with regard to the continuous supply of power during the A/L examination 2022 from 23 January to 17 February 2023.They thereby said that the CEB Chairman is guilty of the offence of contempt under the provisions of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996. The HRCSL said notwithstanding the settlement arrived by the above parties, to provide uninterrupted electricity for the A/L students, during the period of the examination, the CEB willfully and maliciously disregarded the settlement and continued with the power cuts.  They added that the settlement was to prevent the power cut only during the period of the A/L examination while stating that the blatant disregard of the CEB to provide an uninterrupted electricity supply during the examination period is a gross violation of a child’s right to education. When the case was taken up on Friday (10), Court rejected the case on the basis that according to section 24(4) of the HRCSL Act, where the Commission determines a person is guilty of an offence of contempt, it may transmit a certificate to the Supreme Court, setting out the determination and such certificate has to be signed by the Chairman of the HRCSL while noting however that the certificate thus submitted by HRCSL does not contain sufficient material to form charges. Court further held that the documents tendered by the Petitioner itself questions the legality of the settlement and the process culminating in issuing a directive and a certificate.

In addition, they are clear that China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) must advance global standards of transparency, social and environmental impact, and debt sustainability. She said in a letter, to UK MP Sir Stephen Timms, dated 2 February, that they regularly discuss economic policy with the Sri Lankan Government and encourage a transparent, free and open trading environment to drive economic growth and protect vital economic interests such as key industries, commodities, employment and livelihoods. She added that this was a key theme for Lord Ahmad during his visit in January 2022. She stated this in response to Nesan Shankar Raji, of the National Tamil People’s Front, who wrote to his constituency MP  Stephen Timms highlighting that the University of Jaffna refused to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China’s State Agricultural University.   Shankar Raji noted that the Vice-Chancellor, Sivakolondu Srisatkunarajah, chose not to sign the MoU due to concerns that China intends to take land in Sri Lanka under the guise of development in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. He further said in the letter to MP Timms that the Students at the University of Jaffna make the case that China was not supportive of the plight of the Tamil community in Sri Lanka’s recent history. They argue that China helped enable violence against Tamils by blocking justice in international fora and grabbing Sri Lankan assets through debt traps and threats. Further, the students are deeply concerned that the recent MoU attempt points to Chinese plans to seize fertile agricultural land in Northern and Eastern provinces, potentially to manage a food crisis and they also worry that this reflects the Sri Lankan Government engaging in talks with China about selling agricultural land. He questioned whether the UK Government had conversations regarding this with the Sri Lankan counterpart about the MoU attempt? “Does the UK Government share the students’ concerns about Chinese land grabbing in Sri Lanka?” Minister of State for the Indo-Pacific, in response to these queries further said that the British High Commission in Sri Lanka regularly engages with higher education providers on opportunities for cooperation and their operating challenges. The High Commissioner engages in wide ranging visits to the North, more recently to Jaffna where she also discussed challenges facing higher education as a result of external influence. “We’ve always said our approach towards China remains clear-eyed and rooted in our values and our interests. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a Chinese foreign policy initiative. We are clear that the China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) must promote international standards of transparency, social and environmental impact, and debt sustainability. She said, “The UK recognises that some countries have had difficult experiences with BRI projects, including with debt sustainability, transparency, and negative local impacts, for example, many projects deploy carbon intensive technologies such as coal fired power generation. That is why we emphasise the importance of a rigorous approach to standards – in debt sustainability, environmental impact and climate change, social impact and transparency — to ensure viability and sustainability.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/02/11/paying-for-others-mistakes/,Paying for others’ mistakes,Author not found,0,2023-02-10T20:55:54+00:00," He was driving to get lotus flowers for the Kiri Amma Danaya, organised for his three-month-old first born on next day. But the moment his vehicle collided with roadblock, that was placed in a haphazard manner at Kumbuka in Gonapola, Horana, the whole world stopped. The tragic death of Dr. Vimukthi Prasad Jayaweera (37), a scientist at the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) shook the country, because it could have been clearly averted.  He was a resident of Gonapola, Kumbuka East. Investigations revealed that the primary cause of the accident was construction carried out near a man-hole containing underground telephone lines in the Gonapola, Kumbuka area. The roadblock was left behind by contractors working for a leading telecommunication company. The remaining parts of concrete and iron were piled up on the middle of the road without being removed from the place and the road barriers were placed unsafely, the Police said. The foreman of a private construction company was arrested by the Police for Reckless Endangerment and was remanded till 10 February by Horana Chief Magistrate Chandana Kalansuriya. The Traffic OIC of Moragahahena Police told Court the accident could have been averted if the contractor displayed warning signs on the road and followed safety protocols. Paying for others’ mistakes Dr. Jayaweera’s tragic death was caused by two mistakes; both were not his. As said in the beginning of the article, the tragedy was caused by building near a man-hole on the main road that contained subterranean telephone cables. These road barriers were placed on the road, without any warning signs. The emaining pieces of concrete and iron were stacked up in the centre of the street without being removed. Air bag recall The vehicle that Dr. Jayaweera was driving was a Honda Insight, which was equipped with ‘Takata’ model air bag. Just after colliding with the pieces of concrete on the main road, the air bags have opened and a metal piece that came out of the unit had cut his neck, which then damaged his main blood vessels, causing death. The airbag’s inflator, a metal shard containing propellant wafers, in some instances, had previously exploded in several parts of the globe. Metal fragments from the airbag may spray throughout the passenger compartment if the inflator housing ruptures during a collision—a potentially terrible result from a purportedly lifesaving technology. Though ‘Takata’ air bags had been recalled by respective motor companies, at the end of 2022, 11 million of the 67 million airbags that had been recalled had not yet been changed. The root cause of the problem: airbags that use an ammonium-nitrate-based propellant without a chemical drying agent. As postulated early, environmental moisture, high temperatures and age associated with the defect can improperly inflate the airbags and even send shrapnel into the occupant. To date, there have been 24 deaths and more than 400 injuries because this problem in the US. Vehicle Models flagged as being at an extreme risk are certain 2001 to 2003 Honda and Acura models containing so-called ‘Alpha’ airbags, and the 2006 Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickup trucks. Also included are the 1999 BMW 323i and 328i. Local car dealers on several occasions published advertisements recalling vehicles with faulty airbags, similar to those present in the car driven by Dr. Jayaweera. After his death, the dealers again published similar advertisements advising vehicle owners. Accordingly, they have now called for an Air Bag system upgrade recall of the following models: Civic :ES4/ES8/FD1/FD4/FB1, CRV : RD1/RD5/RE2/ RE3/RE4, Accord:CM5/ CL5/CL7/CF8/CF9, Fit/ Jazz GP1/GP2/GP3 /GP4/GE6/ GD1/GD8/GD6, City:GM2/ 3A3, Insight:ZE2/ZE3, Stream : RN3, Integra:DC2, Odyssey: RA3, Corolla 141 : ZRE 141R- AE## / ZZE141R- AE# / CE140R- AEH#AYaris : NCP92R-BE### / NCP42R- BE## / NCP90R- BE## The dealers warned that noncompliance with the above recall may result in injury to the driver and the front seat passenger if airbags are deployed in the event of a collision. UN Global Plan for vehicle safety technologies The UN Global Plan encourages universal deployment of improved vehicle safety technologies for both passive and active safety through a combination of harmonisation of relevant global standards, consumer information schemes and incentives to accelerate the uptake of new technologies. Some of the recommended paths towards this end include: Encouraging UN Member States to apply and promulgate motor vehicle safety regulations as developed by the United Nation’s World Forum for the Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations. Ensuring that all new motor vehicles are equipped with safety-belts and anchorages that meet regulatory requirements and pass applicable crash test standards (as minimum safety features).  l Securing universal deployment of crash avoidance technologies with proven effectiveness such as Electronic Stability Control and Anti-Lock Braking Systems in motorcycles. From the perspective of improving vehicle design and performance for increased safety of occupants in the occurrence of a crash and active crash avoidance systems, the UN Road Safety Collaboration has recommended national adoption and application of a minimum set of priority UN Vehicle Regulations, as follows: l UN Regulations Nos. 14 and 16, which ensure that safety-belts are fitted in vehicles when they are manufactured and assembled and that the safety-belt anchoring points can withstand the impact incurred during a crash, to minimise the risk of belt spillage, and ensure that occupants can safely be removed from their seats post-crash. l UN Regulation No.  78 on Motorcycle anti-lock braking systems, which help the rider maintain control during an emergency braking situation and reduce the likelihood of a road traffic crash and subsequent injury. l UN Regulations Nos. 94 and 95, on frontal and side impact protection, which ensure that vehicles withstand impacts and protect occupants in cases of frontal and side impact crashes, in accordance with specific test parameters defined in these UN Regulations. l UN Regulation No. 127 on Pedestrian front protection, which sets provisions for softer bumpers and modifications of front ends of vehicles to remove unnecessarily rigid structures therein enabling the reduction of pedestrian impact severity and consequences. l UN Regulation No. 129 Enhanced Child Restraint Systems, which sets the design and performance requirements for CRS, ensures that the CRS is securely fitted and held in place in a vehicle with its safety-belts and/or embedded ISOFIX child restraint anchorage points. l UN Regulation No. 140 on Electronic Stability Control (ESC), which sets performance requirements for a system that prevents skidding and loss of control in cases of over-steering and under-steering. It is effective in avoiding single car and roll over crashes, at reducing crashes that may without ESC result in fatalities and serious injuries. It is high time for Sri Lanka to adopt this frame work as every citizen has a right to have a vehicle with necessary safety measures. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

This was disclosed by Verite Research, at the Select Committee of Parliament, to look into and report to Parliament, its recommendations to ensure gender equity and equality with special emphasis on looking into gender-based discriminations and violations of women’s rights in Sri Lanka. The committee meeting was chaired by Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle. Verite Research, presenting facts before the Committee, further stated that as a result of the on-going economic crisis more women are compelled to take up paid labour. However, it was disclosed that limited opportunities for the re-entry and lack of gender-sensitive corporate policies, rigid gender norms and lack of spousal support in addition to childcare support also constrain women from their ability to participate in the labour force. Addressing the Committee, Dr. Fernandopulle said provisions to regulate childcare services are imperative and that the Committee will look into it. The Select Committee also took into discussion the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Bill which was proposed to the Committee by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) and Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA).

More than 95 per cent of State sector employees, who are getting a salary below Rs 100,000 are not liable to pay income tax. Only five per cent who hold high ranks have to pay the tax, for a short period, until the economy is resurrected, Rangebandara said.

Rangebandara said nearly 11 per cent who hold high positions in the private sector come under the new tax policy of the Government. He expressed confidence that the Government will be able to increase the salaries and other payments of State sector employees by the end of this year.  “The State sector officials who receive a high salary must think that people of this country have spent a huge sum of tax money to bring them to their current positions.

Greenlink is holding fresh talks with the Presidential Secretariat on how it was stalled and has expressed keen interest in re-examining the executing of the HEP, as the country is in dire straits in the face of severe financial constraints. In this regard, Greenlink has retained the Chambers of Chrishmal Warnasuriya, as consultants in Sri Lanka, as negotiators with President Ranil Wickremesinghe to develop HEP with State-owned Chinese affiliates. In 2012, the former developer Sithe Global Power Development LLC (Sithe), a fully owned subsidiary of the Blackstone Group USA, executed an exclusive Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for HEP with GoSL. All stakeholders of the Project approved the Feasibility Study of the project in principle, pending a Letter Of Intent (LOI), to negotiate the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) from the Ministry of Power and Energy. Sithe executed Confidentiality and Non-circumvention agreements with State-owned Chinese affiliates and issued Terms of reference which were binding. Further Technical Presentations were made by Greenlink, at the request of the Ministry of Power and Energy, in March 2015 and December 2015, at the Ministry of Power and Energy and at the Sri Lanka Parliament respectively. Subsequently in order to expedite the process of obtaining the LOI, at the request of the GOSL, the Government of Canada (GoC), through its crown corporation Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) expressed its interest in HEP through its letter dated 5 February 2016 to then Secretary of the Ministry of Finance. While negotiations were in progress with Stake Holders of GOSL, a few officials of GOSL handed over HEP development rights to State-owned Chinese affiliates in 2016, in breach of executed agreements. From 2016 to 2020, Greenlink through its counsels communicated with former Presidents Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa and in July 2020, through its Washington Lawyers claimed damages in USD 400 million through the Attorney General of Sri Lanka. At that time the project investment cost was USD 1.4 billion. Since 2016, State-owned Chinese affiliates have failed to develop HEP and today Sri Lanka is facing historic financial and power crises. Had GOSL granted the LOI to Greenlink’s consortium developer, HEP would have been commissioned by April 2020 and would have sustained Sri Lanka’s Economy and contributed significantly to Energy Security in Sri Lanka and avoided the lease of the Port of Hambantota.

This newspaper was unable to immediately contact Siriwardena as to whether his latest circular meant that no monies would be released by the Treasury for the forthcoming Local Government (LG) Elections.

This was when the Contempt of Court case, filed by HRCSL, against the CEB Chairman, Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy and the Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, over the failure to supply continuous power during the GCE Advanced Level Examination period, was taken up. While CEB gave an undertaking on Thursday (2), that no power cuts will be imposed until the case is taken up for support on Friday (3), President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing on behalf of CEB informed Court that they will not proceed with the undertaking. Thereby, although President’s Counsel Upul Jayasuriya, making submissions on behalf of HRCSL on Thursday (2), sought interim relief preventing the CEB from imposing power cuts during the A/L examination period, Court held that since the respondents are not proceeding with the undertaking, Court is not inclined to grant interim relief. HRCSL observed that the respondents have failed to abide by the settlement arrived at before the Commission with regard to the continuous supply of power during the A/L examination 2022, from 23 January to 17 February 2023.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/02/04/tax-policy-has-not-shown-how-to-reduce-govt-spending/,tax policy has not shown how to reduce Govt spending,Author not found,0,2023-02-03T19:43:51+00:00," The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CASL), in a letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, stated that Government’s recent tax policy change was not accompanied by an adequate communication strategy and the CASL’s stakeholders are also of the opinion that the taxes were increased without a corresponding plan to reduce Government expenditures. They also suggested to the President that the Government could also announce a strategy to minimise expenditures along with the revised tax policy. One of the suggestions tabled by the CASL was for public salary costs to be reduced by not replacing retiring employees, and all the loss-making entities such as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Ceylon Electricity Board, and SriLankan Airlines could be restructured to reduce expenses over the next two years, at least, while also taking measures to reduce Government bond-related interest expenditure, which will result in a reduction of the tax burden. The letter dated 30 January 2023, further noted that the tax policy should not have a long-term negative impact and taxation should be done in a way that does not unduly burden citizens’ ability to afford a reasonable living standard. “We have received numerous complaints from stakeholders, including our own members, regarding the recent implementation of the tax policy. The increased personal income taxes have been particularly palpable, as evidenced by reduced take-home pay. This has become a pressing issue for many white-collar employees, particularly considering high inflation levels and higher interest rates. The combined effect of these factors has led to a substantial decrease in disposable income and will likely have a significant impact on various industries, including financial services,” the CASL said in the letter. Additionally, they have also observed a migration of young professionals from the country. “While international exposure and the opportunity to accumulate wealth can be beneficial for young professionals, the departure of even experienced professionals is causing a significant knowledge gap. This trend is likely to result in a critical shortage of human resources and a lack of necessary expertise to drive our nation’s sustainable growth and development.” Urging the Government to announce a strategy to reduce expenditures along with the revised tax policy, the letter further explained that the Government expenditure cannot be reduced overnight, it can be done within a reasonable period.” “If a well-communicated, structured plan is implemented with a reasonable timeline, the taxpayers are likely to extend their support without many grievances. In the meantime, efforts must also be made to expand the tax base, which would reduce the tax burden on a small segment of taxpayers. We are certain that your Government has a rational plan under your leadership. However, this has not been effectively communicated to the stakeholders. Lack of communication and high tax burden has created room for misinterpretation and could result in civil unrest and possible tax evasion, leading to lower-than-expected tax revenue for the Government.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

In a letter to CEB’s Additional General Manager, PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said the decision was taken to ensure the fundamental rights of the GCE Advanced Level students who are currently sitting for the exam.

P.S.M. Charles, a Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS) officer resigned last week, sending her resignation letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. It is said that several problems have arisen with regard to holding the election, especially within the EC itself, which had led her to resign from her post. Charles was appointed in November 2022 while the other three members were appointed by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa when he came to power in 2019.   According to sources, the EC has not received a positive response from several stakeholders, including the CPC which is supposed to supply fuel for the election, despite members of many political parties filing their nominations. The CPC had declined to release fuel for the LG polls while some of the stakeholders have not even attended meetings hosted by the Chairman of the Election Commission in order to set the stage for the polls. One of the meetings required the attendance of a senior Ministry Secretary but he had failed to turn up, signalling that there is a lack of support for holding the election. The LG poll is not yet to be gazetted but could be gazetted four days before the polls, based on the country’s constitutional provisions. These ‘old’ commissions, under the 21A have to be revoked and new members should be selected for all independent commissions. It is said the Chair of the Election Commission was appointed under the 20A and is also an acting Chair and so is the current membership of five, including the Chair while the incumbent President is on the verge of appointing a new Election Commission, having consulted the Constitutional Council. One sitting of the Constitutional Council has been held in order to appoint all the independent commissions. It is clearly stated that following the new appointments for the commissions, including the EC, within the next two weeks the date for the LG polls could be announced. In the meantime, the Government is also looking to reduce the number of Pradeshiya Sabha members from 8,750 to 4,000 and then holding the LG polls in the backdrop of a horrendous financial crisis, it is learnt.

Issuing a statement, the HRCSL said, the case has been filed on the basis of ‘defaming the authority of the HRCSL’ under the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act, as the CEB failed to adhere to the agreement of providing uninterrupted electricity until the conclusion of A/L Examination. Meanwhile, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara said he was informed by Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy that the officials that took part in the discussion with HRCSL were pressurised to sign two documents that they did not agree to by two members of the HRCSL and were threatened with jail sentences. “The officials have already sought legal opinion on the steps to be taken against the HRCSL members and have submitted, in writing, what had taken place. I have informed the President, yesterday morning and will inform the Constitutional council in writing,” he tweeted. Furthermore, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) also slammed the HRCSL, in writing for not listening to CPC officers’ appeals at a meeting to discuss power outages during the A/L examination. As a result, CPC officers questioned whether their human rights were violated during the HRCSL meeting. In the letter, the General Manager of CPC noted that without proper consideration and respect for CPC officers’ requests, they cannot give consent as requested by the HRCSL without the approval of the CPC’s top management (Board of Directors), and that the HRCSL simply gave the approval of corporation officials to the unilateral opinion.

Holding a media briefing, along with the heads of departments that come under his purview, Minister Alles said owing to the drug menace, the younger generation has been severely affected. “I tell the drug racketeers to stop their operations immediately, or we will destroy their operations. I will never hesitate to take necessary action to eradicate this menace,” he stressed. The Minister said he is specially focused on eradicating underworld activities and drug rackets in the country this year. “I personally believe that the death penalty should be given for rape, drug related offences and murder. This is my personal opinion only. It is clear that in parallel to drug rackets, underworld crimes have increased as well. We have launched a special operation to curb these crimes,” he added.

Wickramaratne said he is yet to receive the third DNA report confirming death of Sara Jasmine, alias Pulasthini Mahendran, from the Government Analyst. In response to a question raised during a media briefing at the Public Security Ministry, the IGP said about a week ago, the Government Analyst’s Department requested for some equipment to carry out the test. Upon receiving the necessary equipment, the tests can be concluded and the report will be presented accordingly, he added. Quoting an official at the Government Analyst Department, Ceylon Today, reported on 18 October 2022 that the third DNA report was concluded and presented to the relevant authorities. According to an official at the Government Analyst’s Department, the DNA report has been submitted to the Police and the Court. However, he did not disclose the contents of the report.      The investigators intend to re-examine the DNA to determine whether the remains of Sara, an Islamist extremist and member of Zahran Hashim’s terror group, are among those who died inside the Sainthamaruthu safe house raided on 26 April 2019. Sara Jasmine is the wife of Atchchi Muhammadu Muhammadu Hasthun, the suicide bomber responsible for the Katuwapitiya St. Sebastian’s Church bombing on 21 April 2019. Just days after the Easter Sunday Attacks, several persons, including children, were killed in a bomb explosion inside a house in Sainthamaruthu, Kalmunai on 26 April. Mohamed Rilwan, one of Zahran Hashim’s brothers detonated the bomb. Despite the fact that 17 people died in the explosion, the DNA samples taken from the bodies on two occasions did not match Pulasthini’s mother. There were suspicions that Sara Jasmine had fled to India, following a testimony of a witness before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on the Easter Sunday Attacks, who claimed she could have tipped off Indian intelligence about the impending attack. The remains of those killed in the Sainthamaruthu bomb blast in 2019 were exhumed on 27 April, following an order from the Kalmunai Magistrate’s Court. The remains buried at the Ampara cemetery were exhumed in the presence of the Ampara Magistrate, the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO), and Police Officers involved in the initial investigations, as well as the Government Analyst.

Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe said on Friday (27) that the Professionals Trade Union Alliance (PTUA) was scheduled to convene a meeting on Monday (30) to decide on further trade union action against the Health Ministry’s and the Government’s indifference.

President’s Counsel Faiszer Mustapha, appearing for the former President, submitted to Court that his client was compelled to do so since the Court of Appeal had issued a stay order postponing magisterial inquiry against his client.

He also advised former President to be present in the Defendant’s dock hereafter if he is going to be present in any Court as a suspect. Sirisena was then seen getting into the defendant’s dock when he was summoned for a second time. The case is due to be taken up on 17 March. By Hansi Nanayakkara"

These regulations cover licensed commercial banks (LCBs), licensed specialised banks (LSBs), licensed finance companies (LFCs),  specialised leasing companies (SLCs), authorised primary dealers (APDs), authorised money brokers (AMBs) and licensed microfinance institutions (LMIs) and participants of payments and settlement systems or any other type of financial service providers (FSPs) approved by CBSL’s Monetary Board and already regulated by CBSL , it said. Under the proposed regulations, the above, broadly known as FSPs, will be regulated by the Financial Consumer Relations Department (FCRD), it said. CBSL’s FCRD shall have the power to monitor, evaluate, and examine the implementation of financial consumer protection (FCP) regulations by FSPs and perform activities connected to FCP to maintain trust and confidence in the financial system of Sri Lanka, CBSL said. Under the proposed regulations, if the FCRD is of the opinion that an FSP is carrying on or is likely to carry on its business following unsound or improper financial practices, which are detrimental to the interest of its financial consumers or 6.2 has contravened or failed to comply with any provisions of these regulations, or any direction, guidelines or requirement made or imposed there under, the Monetary Board (MB) would i. impose a penalty not exceeding  Rs 500,000 payable within such period as may be specified by the MB. ii. Direct such FSP to cease any such practice; iii. Direct such FSP to take necessary action to correct the conditions resulting from such practice or contravention; iv. Direct the FSP to revise the features, terms or conditions of a product, v. Direct the FSP to remove a product from the market; vi. Direct the FSP to remove advertising from the market; vii. Direct the FSP compensate or refund consumers; viii. Publish the name of the FSP as an FSP regarding which the MB has serious supervisory concerns; ix. Restrain any director, manager or employee of FSP from carrying out any function in or in relation to FSP; and x. Remove any director, manager or employee of FSP, it said. The FSP shall ensure that debt recovery processes are transparent, courteous and fair, devoid of undue pressure, intimidation, harassment, humiliation or threat, CBSL said. CBSL has called for public comments in respect of setting up the above regulatory authority. FSPs are already governed and regulated by the CBSL under various laws, acts, regulations and departments operating within the CBSL. It’s unclear what the status of the existing regulators such as CBSL’s Banking Department and Non-Bank Finance Institutions Department of CBSL would be, once the FCRD comes on board. CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe was not immediately available for comment. BY Paneetha Ameresekere"

Addressing the press Small Hydro Power Association Secretary, Warna Dahanayake Attorney at Law said, “We the renewable energy sector of this country is firmly and steadfastly extending our support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe who at the COPE 27 of 8th November 2022 firmly pledged his commitment to increasing the renewable energy contribution to the grid to 70 per cent which at the moment stands at 12 per cent.  Also to reduce the carbon footprint to 14.5 per cent from present levels by 2030. At this crucial moment of national crisis, therefore it is not a time for petty bickering but a time we must raise up and stand by the President who has a clear vision to lead us out of this crisis to prosperity. In order to achieve this he said that countries that are interested in investing and being a part of this country’s progress should be brought together to make this project a success. Consequently, this pledge given by the President to the international community should also be a guide and path for our development. Speaking further he said, today the danger is the country losing its capacity to produce and supply the country’s energy and power needs. This present risk of losing 1200MW of power supplied by the renewable energy sector to the national grid is genuine and will have certain adverse repercussions on the country. This loss to the grid will cause longer power outages and higher tariffs. The shortfall of this power will have to be met only by using costly imported fuel. This will translate into further raising of tariffs, which are already raising grave concerns among all sectors of industry and the domestic market. Therefore, this will also discourage both local and foreign investment in the future he said. Speaking on the present situation, Small Hydro Power Association Secretary, Warna Dahanayake Attorney at Law said, it is an opportune moment that the President is of this view and commitment as the renewable energy sector has in hand projects that can immediately add 150 to 500MW to ease the present power shortage situation which is affecting the country. Nevertheless, it is very encouraging and fortunate that the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka under Section 35 of 2002 has by this act been empowered to take all measures to protect and nurture this sector. In its scope of authority, PUCSL has all the required power to intervene and direct the relevant departments to act in any way necessary. Moreover, the settlement of the dues to the sector is an issue that has been tackled by placing this in a proper place of priority in the order of payments made. Whilst having large loan outstandings to local banks all this can be sorted with proper prioritization of settlement, Small Hydro Power Association, Secretary, Warna Dahanayake Attorney at Law concluded."

The programme aims to provide additional assistance to help people reduce their daily food expenses, with a special emphasis on children and the elderly. The country’s economic crisis has affected many households, causing chaos in many lives, and SLRCS has stepped forward to distribute food parcels among low-income families, affected by the food crisis in selected districts, where food and nutrition gaps have been identified. Furthermore, during the beneficiary selection process, women-headed households and children living with their grandparents were prioritised. The ongoing programme, which was supported by the Red Cross Society of China and coordinated by the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Sri Lanka, resulted in more than 9,000 vulnerable families receiving dry ration food packs, which ultimately contributed to improving the beneficiaries’ nutrition conditions. Chairman of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, Jagath Abeysinghe said: “It is with tremendous pleasure I express my gratitude to our colleagues in China, their generosity and support rendered during a challenging time for our nation. Sri Lanka will overcome these obstacles because we have friends like colleagues at the Red Cross Society of China, who continue to assist us. SLRCS will always be at the forefront of assisting people in difficult times.” The donation worth of USD 190,000 took place in the districts of Colombo, Gampaha, Nuwara Eliya, Kandy and Matale, in the areas of Homagama, Kollonnawa, Hanwella, Biyagama, Dompe, Mirigama, Katana, Gampaha, Mahara, Divulapitiya, Negombo, Nuwara Eliya, Haguranketha, Walapane, Nuwara Eliya, Abagamuwa, Harispaththuwa, Pasbage Korale, Gangawata Koralage, Panvila and Delthota.

Speaking at the all-party conference held on Thursday (26) Wickremesinghe stated that the Cabinet was agreeable to fully implementing the 13th Amendment, unless it is decided by the Party Leaders as to whether or not the Amendment should be abolished. He noted that he is bound to implement the existing law, as per the Executive powers vested with the President. He said further that the 13th Amendment to the Constitution is being implemented accordingly or the Parliament should abolish it. President Wickremesinghe also pointed out that any parliamentarian could move a private member’s Bill to abolish the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and the same amendment would have to be implemented provided that the Bill was voted against by the majority of the House. The President stressed that he was not ready to divide the country at all and would not betray the Sinhalese nation as well. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks at the All-Party Conference, which was held at the Presidential Secretariat on Thursday (26). The statement made by the President: “It is my responsibility as the Executive to carry out the current law. For approximately 37 years, the 13th Amendment has been a part of the Constitution. I must implement or someone has to abolish it by way of a 22nd Amendment to the Constitution by moving a private member’s Bill. If the Bill was voted against by the majority in the House, then the 13th Amendment would have to be implemented.” “We can’t remain in the middle saying that either we don’t implement the 13th Amendment or abolish it,” President Wickremesinghe said. “I’m acting in accordance with the decision delivered by the Supreme Court regarding the 13th Amendment, in particular, Chief Justice Palinda Ranasinghe’s ruling. If we stick to that, we might say that we are in a ‘united’ State. I don’t oppose a Federal State but devolution of power. The Provincial Councils in Sri Lanka don’t at least have the powers that are vested in the London City Council. Hence we can’t define this as a Federal State. “The late President J.R. Jayewardene introduced many clauses along with the Attorneys-at-Law, not to make Sri Lanka a Federal State. So far, every President has decided to put this into action. “So, either we ought to get rid of the 13th amendment or should implement it. A massive extension of land was under the government by the time the conflict came to an end in 2009 and thereafter most of those lands were released to the public during the reigns of former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena. “The largest extension of lands in Jaffna was issued under the reign of former President Maithripala Sirisena. There is only a land extension of 3,000 acres under the government as of now. “The release of that extension land too should be entrusted to the Security Forces to be done without causing interruption to the security activities. We discussed the release of those lands with the Defence Secretary, the Chief of Defence Staff, and the Commanders of Tri Forces and acted upon their views. The Land Commission needs to be established immediately. The draft Bill in that regard could be moved by March. The Constitution has it that nine representatives from each province should be included, while 12 are appointed by the President. Then a national land policy should be formulated. Thereafter the National Land Policy could be put into action by the Land Commission. “Thirty per cent (30%) or more of the country is covered by forest. Here the lands have been allocated suddenly for forests in an unorganised manner. However, we have deforested the up country as well as the areas where the Mahaweli, Kelani and Kalu rivers commence. Somehow, the forest cover should be increased. We should allow the Land Commission to decide on the extent of land required to enhance the forest cover in accordance with the government’s policy up to 30%. I am dedicated to that endeavour too. “If establishment of the National Police Commission instead of a Provincial Police Commission is objected to, an amendment should be made. However either should be done. The measures that would be taken in this regard would be presented to the Parliament on 8 February. And, if there are any suggestions, they could be made before 4 February that they may be considered and submitted on February 8. Neither any one here is nor am I ready to divide our country. The majority of us who are seated here are Sinhalese. These individuals will not betray the Sinhalese."

Jaishankar wrapped up his two-day visit to Colombo on Friday (20), saying India has cleared its path by giving assurance to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it would restructure its debt with Sri Lanka but he made sure that all bilateral creditors are treated equally. Jaishankar said they decided not to wait on others but to do what they believe is right. “We felt strongly that Sri Lanka’s creditors must take proactive steps to facilitate its recovery,” the Indian Bureaucrat said. He said India extended financing assurances to the IMF to clear the way for Sri Lanka to move forward and that their expectation is that this will not only strengthen Sri Lanka’s position, but ensure that all bilateral creditors are dealt with equally. Sri Lanka’s USD 2.9 billion IMF bailout facility has been delayed primarily because bilateral creditors India, Japan, and China have not agreed to restructure the loan facility for nearly six months, after the IMF placed a condition to do so, in order for the loan to be approved. In this mission, India was the first to make a move, and the Sri Lankan Government expressed confidence that China and Japan would follow suit. Dr. Jaishankar said his primary purpose of coming to Colombo was to express India’s solidarity and support Sri Lanka to get through its economic crisis under its ‘Neighbourhood First’ Policy. The Indian Envoy reaffirmed Sri Lanka’s political stability and stated that President Wickremesinghe had this time briefed him on the subject of political devolution and his ideas, while the Indian Minister had also discussed with him the importance of early provincial elections and the full implementation of the 13A. The visiting Indian Minister continued saying that sustained efforts toward reconciliation are in the best interests of all groups in Sri Lanka and highlighted the importance of paying particular attention to the needs of the Tamil population of Indian descent. Dr. Jaishankar emphasised on the enormous renewable energy potential that could become a reliable source of income and the potential for Trincomalee to become an energy hub as part of India’s request for Indian investments in Sri Lanka. In order to advance their cooperation, India and Sri Lanka also reached an in principle understanding on a framework for renewable energy. The Indian Foreign Minister also highlighted the importance of boosting connectivity and encouraging travel while focusing on Indian visitors to Sri Lanka. He emphasised that they would urge Indian tourists to use UPI and make RuPay payments. During the Indian Minister’s visit, a number of important initiatives were concluded at the Presidential Secretariat in the presence of President Wickremesinghe. This included the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Indian Grant Assistance for the Implementation of High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDP) focusing on socioeconomic development, infrastructure in the education, health, and community development sectors. Minister Jaishankar also participated in three virtual inauguration ceremonies to handover the Kandyan Dancing Academy, under the Sri Dalada Maligawa Heritage Project, to hand over 24 houses each in Anuradhapura and Badulla Districts under the Model Housing Village Project and to handover 300 houses under Phase-3 of the Indian Housing Project: 100 houses each in the Kandy, Nuwara Eliya and Galle Districts. He also delivered Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s invitation to President Ranil Wickremesinghe to visit India soon to discuss how India can help Sri Lanka’s strong recovery. Before departure to India, Dr. Jaishankar also met with Prime Ministe Dinesh Gunawardene, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa who thanked India’s initiatives and also discussed a range of issues of mutual interest.

The five countries which were ahead of Sri Lanka were Zimbabwe (376 per cent), Lebanon (171 per cent), Venezuela (158 per cent), Argentina (94 per cent) and Turkiye (77 per cent). The WB has tracked the inflation movement of 176 economies. Sri Lanka has been described as being a ‘low income’ country (LIC) by the WB. The WB has captured 67 out of the 176 countries tracked as being low income countries. This WB document titled ‘Food Security Update’, warned that global food prices are expected to remain high. It further said that high fertiliser prices have become a significant obstacle to food production in many low-income countries.  Food inflation during pregnancy and in the first years of a child’s life is associated with greater risk of child wasting in the short run and stunting in the long run, the WB said. “High inflation, tight monetary policy, and debt distress are expected to restrain domestic consumption and investment in LICs. The cost-of-living crisis has pushed many more people into food insecurity, especially in LICs, where fragility was high even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” the WB said.

Their splits comprise Rs 60 billion 91-day maturities and Rs 30 billion each of 182- and 364-day maturities.  Prior to Wednesday’s offering of Rs 120 billion worth of T-Bills to the market, the previous highest was  Rs 98 billion issued on five occasions. Those five occasions were, 8 June 2022, 15 June 2022, 14 December 2022, 28 December 2022 and 4 January 2023. Issuing of T-Bills is a popular way that the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) raises money from the local market to meet its short-term monetary needs. Ceylon, as Sri Lanka was then known, first began issuing T Bills to the market 100 years ago in 1923, when the country was a colony of the British. Subsequently in 1937, Ceylon’s colonial Raj, to meet its medium to long-term borrowing needs, began issuing T-Bonds. T-Bills and T-Bonds are administered by the CBSL on behalf of the GoSL.  Investments in T-Bonds and T-Bills are generally risk-free, because, in the event GoSL is unable to repay such debt, CBSL is mandated to print demand-pull inflationary money and repay such creditors. Money printing is the CBSL’s sole and exclusive prerogative. By Paneetha Ameresekere"

Some of the top diplomats, including US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung and IMF Deputy Director of the IMF’s Strategy Policy and Review Department have been criticising China and India’s delaying the debt restructuring process, implying that it is impeding the IMF loan of USD 2.6 billion that would provide some relief to Sri Lanka, which is economically drowning. In a recent BBC interview, US Envoy Chung stated that China is a “spoiler” as it keeps delaying in debt restructuring for Sri Lanka while IMF’s Flanagan told the international media yesterday (13), that the longer Sri Lanka’s creditors, including China and India, delay their debt restructuring the greater the cost becomes and warned that 10 per cent of the global population could be exposed to a debt crisis. As the noose is tightened on China urging them not to delay in helping Sri Lanka, a high-level Communist Party of China (CPC) delegation, led by its International Deputy Vice Minister Chen Zhou, will visit Sri Lanka from 14 to 18 January. It is scheduled to meet Government leaders and political parties of Sri Lanka, the Chinese Embassy revealed. Also on 10 January, Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of China Wu Fulin held a fruitful video conference with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and exchanged views on bilateral cooperation and Sri Lanka’s current debt issues. The two sides agreed to further strengthen exchanges and collaboration on the resolution of Sri Lanka’s debt issues, and help the island’s economic recovery and sustainable development, the Chinese Embassy said.  The World Bank estimates that Sri Lanka’s economy shrank by 9.2 per cent in 2022 and that it will contract by a further 4.2 per cent this year which would lead the country to a precipice if not attended to.  Also, the BBC highlighted that Chinese loans stands at USD 7 billion while Indian loans stand at USD 1 billion. Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe  admitted that there is  delay in restructuring the loan and added he hoped that they could get the assurances within three months or so that the IMF programme could be  unlocked by December 2022  Weerasinghe said, it was possible an agreement could come later in January but added, “This all depends on the other parties – our creditors really have to make that decision.” US Ambassador Chung, said the greater onus was on China, as the biggest bilateral lender. Beijing has said they are fond of Sri Lanka and it is the Sri Lankan people who are about to see that turn in to action and they will make sure there is no delay. She emphasised that Beijing should respond quickly because Sri Lanka has no time to waste. “We have seen there are delays in Zambia and other countries and for one reason or the other it has been held up. She said China has been the ‘spoiler’.  “For the sake of the Sri Lankan people, we certainly hope China is not a spoiler as they proceed to attain this IMF agreement.” As there seems to be some actions from the Chinese side it’s still not known what India’s stance, despite their advocating the IMF bailout for Sri Lanka from day one. At this outset, a top envoy from the US security, Rear Admiral Eileen Laubacher, who is the US Senior Director for South Asia for National Security Council, also visited Sri Lanka last week and met the President to discuss maritime matters and to furtherstrengthen US ties with Sri Lanka.

She had travelled from Kandy to Colombo by train with her friend. A person, who was suspicious about the two girls travelling alone, had inquired about where they were going and later informed about it to their parents. As the parents had requested the youth to keep the girls in his custody until their arrival, the trio had arrived at the Galle Face Green, waiting for the arrival of the parents. During this time, the 15-year-old girl had gone missing, while her friend had remained with the youth and was handed over to her parents. There is no information regarding the child after that.

Externally, he said, giving an example of Iran being sanctioned by the US when Sri Lanka’s refinery uses Iran crude oil, but due to the sanction Sri Lanka had to stop buying oil from Iran. “We have a refinery that uses only Iran crude oil and due to the US trade sanction on Iran, we had to stop and the energy crisis came in,” he said. He went on to say big countries like India and Europe   continued trade with Iran, to use their petroleum, but Sri Lanka was affected because Sri Lanka cannot do trade settlements due to the sanctions. He also pointed out that even now with the ongoing Russian-Ukraine war, India and China and some other countries still import petroleum from Russia. “But as a small country we cannot import, and as a result we are paying a higher price for petroleum. Our country is basically affected more in terms of fragmentation disproportionally,” he added.   Speaking on the internal policies, he recalled Sri Lanka’s trade integration, where it was one of the first countries in Asia that opened the economy in 1977.  “We integrated with the region and the world at the beginning for several decades and then moved backwards due to internal policies and nationalistic protectionism. From open economy we became a more protectionist closed economy which is one of the reasons why we are facing the crisis.” He added there are inconsistencies in the internal policies which are moving back and forth. External reasons we have no control over, but the internal inconsistency has affected the country badly. The panel discussion was held among Deputy Managing Director Antoinette Sayeh, Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari, Bangladesh State Minister of Planning Shamsul Alam, India’s Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran, and CBSL Governor P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, who exchanged their views on how South Asia can build on its development success in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Governor Nandalal further responded to the question on the current situation and how to face the monetary challenges and that of institutions both from short and longer term perspective in terms of growth. He said that strong independent institutions matter a lot. “The macro policy needs strong institutions. Earlier all indicators, such as social and poverty, showed Sri Lanka was above many countries in the region but in the last two years it was a complete turnaround. There is a lack of strong institutions and missteps that basically turned around the decades of good work. It took us backwards to several decades in terms of permanent losses in outputs. More people are below the poverty line compared to the charts where we were well above. What’s the reason for this? Its lack of strong independent institutions,” he pointed out. He said that is why for 16 times Sri Lanka has gone to the IMF and this time it would be the 17th. In the last 10 IMF programmes for Sri Lanka, they have had the same objectives such as consultations, high debts and some payment issues. “So we have been going back and forth. The reason why we go two steps forward and one step back means no progress. That is because we have strong fiscal rules, no independent regulatory instructions, no strong independent public service, politicising all the government operations are the reasons why we are moving to large debts and we have borrowed and lived on for many years.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

PMC was declared open on 29 July 2021 at the ground floor of the old Standard Chartered Bank building, in front of the President’s House in Colombo Fort. This was equipped with a number of facilities and could host up to 40 journalists at a time. The Presidential Secretariat has spent Rs 7,582,837.46, and only conducted 24 press conferences in the PMC from 29 July 2021 to 8 April 2022. Sisira Kumara Henadheera, Senior Assistant Secretary to President said, that Rs 4,743,656.64 has been spent for civil engineering construction, Rs 942,199. 52 for electrical engineering construction and Rs 1,896, 981.30 for carpet and curtains, which was outsourced work. The PMC was established to provide accurate and efficient information to the media and the public on the progress of the implementation of programmes to fulfil the pledges made to the people in the policy statement, ‘Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour’, the President Media Division (PMD) said, in a statement, when it was opened. The Presidential Secretariat spent a large sum of State money and established PMC, while the Department of Government Information has been leading the publicity campaign of the Government for the last several decades. Kingsley Rathnayake, Spokesman of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, moderated the press conferences in the PMC, and PMD invited only selected media people to attend the conferences. Rathnayake told the media at that time that PMC had been created based on the weekly press briefings conducted by the White House in the United States (US). However, he resigned from the post of Presidential Spokesman and left for Australia, a few months before Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s resignation. “The facilities of the PMC accommodate Government institutions to arrange the press conferences and two press conferences have been conducted during the month of September,” the Presidential Secretariat said in response to the RTI request.

The top diplomat stated that Rosatom, the State Nuclear Energy Corporation of Russia, Headquartered in Moscow, had discussions with Sri Lanka. “It depends on Sri Lanka and how quickly it would want two mini nuclear power stations,” the Envoy said. He added that the Sri Lankan Government has to decide how quickly they would want to build the two mini nuclear power plants. “How fast we can build it depends on the Government of Sri Lanka, which is why we’re talking about the options,” he said. “I have also discussed this and other related matters, as well as some plans for meetings with several other Ministers, including Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. We also had three rounds of video conferences on various topics such as ammonia and nuclear energy cyclotron,” he pointed out. The Russian Envoy said, they had tabled the proposal for two mini nuclear power stations. “It must be at least two, but Sri Lanka has the option of having more. The cost, how many, and other details would be negotiated.” In an interview with Ceylon Today, Ambassador Dzhagaryan said, they have implemented nuclear power stations in India, Bangladesh and are working on the second and third phase of a nuclear power station in Iran. Recently, the Russian Ambassador had held discussions with the Minister of Power and Energy on the need for fuel, refinery operations, and problems with coal supply and there is an upcoming agreement between Rosatom and the nuclear energy firm with Sri Lankan officials.  “I recently met the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board. I also met Kanchana Wijesekara, the Minister of Energy. Our plan is to assist Sri Lanka in the construction of two mini nuclear power plants for official use. Each station would have a capacity of 55 megawatts,” the Russian Envoy said. To begin with, it could be two plants, then four plants, and finally six plants. This suggestion was critical from several perspectives. First and foremost, this would save oil and coal. Second, because there will be no coal, it will be environmentally-friendly, and the ecology will be safe and secure. It’s also less expensive, he added. The Russian Envoy said, he aims to push for a visible high-level delegation, because he has experience working with Rosatom and Iran where for 11 years he was the Ambassador. He said, Tehran has oil and gas, unlike Sri Lanka, but they are interested in nuclear power as well. It’s cheaper and they can save oil and gas and export it to others. He said, all the details related to the power plants would be discussed when the delegation from the Russian Federation comes here. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

President and General Secretary of the AMS, Drs Lakkumar Fernando and R. Gnanasekeram expressed extreme concern with regard to unprecedented and unacceptable actions of Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and his officials towards medical practitioners. They said, “AMS reliably understands that certain high officials of the Health Ministry have written to the SLMC instructing it to cancel the registration of medical practitioners who have been served ‘vacation of post’ letters,” the duo said. It is clear that on this occasion certain high officials of the Health Ministry had over stepped their authority to engage in an unfair and illegal act of harassing a group of doctors, they charged.  “We also understand that the same officials have written to overseas Medical Councils like the General Medical Council (GMC) to initiate disciplinary inquiries on account of vacation of post in Sri Lanka,” they alleged noting that they were certain that those medical councils would not pursue any disciplinary inquiries into these unfair requests by the Sri Lankan health officials. They vehemently protest against this action taken by the Health Ministry, the Doctors said that the Vacation of posts by medical practitioners happened many times in the past and on none of these occasions has the Health Ministry requested the SLMC to cancel the registration of such doctors. The AMS office bearers pointed out that there was no change of regulations pertaining to the “professional misconduct” of the medical practitioners recently. They noted that the above action was initiated only for selective group of doctors and not for all medical officers who had vacated their posts. The AMS believes that vacation of post was only a disturbance of employer – employee relationship. This certainly cannot be labelled as ‘professional misconduct,’ according to the SLMC regulations pertaining to professional misconduct which was on par with international norms. Drs Fernando and Gnanasekeram further said there were many more professionals other than medical practitioners who had vacated their posts. But, no other ministry has requested the cancellation of their respective licenses to practice from the relevant regulators. “SLMC is an independent body governed by internationally recognised regulations with regards to disciplinary matters, therefore no one can ‘instruct’ it to cancel the registration of a medical practitioner as the procedure involves a proper complaint in the form of an affidavit, a duly conducted inquiry by the professional conduct committee of the Council and a final ratification by it.  The AMS said they had also noticed that the SLMC has responded appropriately to Health Secretary’s request. The AMS office bearers said they were aware and were in agreement that any government officer who had not reported to duty without approved leave should be served vacation of post subject to the provision of the establishment code and that if an officer with a financial bond vacated his post, appropriate action should be taken to recover such a bond.  But, any other high handed, arbitrary actions, not within the existing regulations, cannot be applied selectively to medical practitioners. They warned that their outfit would not hesitate to resort to any suitable trade union actions against these moves in collaboration with other unions and professional groups. (DJ)"

The project’s consortium, led by US based Research Triangle International (RTI) works alongside local partners to target system inefficiencies and areas of reliance on virgin plastics, it said. The project’s overall goal is to increase participation in solid waste management and reduction programmes, preventing thousands of tons of plastic from leaking into the environment. “USAID is proud to partner with the Governments of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, the private sector, civil society, and communities to reduce, reuse and recycle plastic products, which threaten the health and environment of the Sri Lankan and Maldivian people,” the statement quoting Gabe Grau, USAID/Sri Lanka and Maldives Mission Director, said.  “Combating plastic pollution will reduce threats to marine ecosystems and livelihoods, food security, and ultimately, human health.” Ocean plastic pollution threatens the world’s delicate marine ecosystems, the fishing and tourism sectors, food security, and human health. The equivalent of an entire garbage truck of plastic makes its way into the world’s oceans every minute—roughly eleven million tons annually. Stopping plastic pollution at the source is the most effective way to address this challenge. The majority of plastic ocean debris comes from rapidly growing cities along coastal areas in the developing world where Governments struggle with growing populations and increasing amounts of waste. Sri Lanka and Maldives face unique challenges in waste management. In Sri Lanka, the country’s solid waste management systems struggle to keep pace with growing urban populations. (PA)"

The birth of baby Jesus in impoverished surroundings signifies the dedication of His life to creating a better society, the President said. He said, “This would be a salutation to the testament of Jesus Christ. It is appropriate to recall the appeal of His Holiness Pope Francis for a humble Christmas this year, with the savings from reduced spending on gifts to be donated to the needy and value humanity.  It is the Government’s aspiration to present the joy of Christmas to the entirety of society. It is imperative for all citizens to resolve to fulfil their responsibilities this Christmas season, and propagate devotion to all. As we celebrate the event of the birth of Jesus Christ, I pray that our country will soon be restored with prosperity. I wish everyone a happy Christmas in which the gospel of humanity, harmony and sacrifice that Jesus Christ desired, will spread far and wide.”"

It is difficult to be but easy to have”, Cardinal Ranjith said, observing that what people had did not last long in comparison to what they were.      He said that poverty was experienced by most of the people. “Therefore, it was important to understand that poverty is not a curse. It can be a blessing. Richness need not be a blessing but can be a curse”, he observed. It is said that 8.1 million people were on the brink of starvation. “If that is so we cannot celebrate Christmas only on the basis of eating, drinking and merry making – unconcerned about others. Christmas has to be a moment of sharing and an extension of our help to the poor,” he said. “Jesus deigned to be born among the poor worked and lived as a poor person, and he cherished the freedom of the poor,” the Cardinal said calling upon the Christian community in the island to spend their Christmas with the poor. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference in Sri Lanka has made an appeal especially to  Christians to spend Christmas in extravagance because this was not the time for that. “Instead let us spend Christmas with our brethren who are seriously affected by the situation that exists in our country,” he urged.

The report, titled ‘BIMSTEC Trade Facilitation Strategic Framework 2030’, further said measures such as approval of the new Customs Act and the development of the ‘Port Community System’ (PCS) are likely to stall until the situation is stabilised and international loan assistance is finalised. The problem of debt financing may also potentially limit further loans from international financial institutions (IFIs), including any for trade facilitation infrastructure development projects, but should not necessarily affect technical assistance provided by these external organisations, the ADB report said. The report further said that Sri Lanka’s large number of low trade facility agreement (TFA) Category ‘C’ ratings is a cause for concern. Many of these low ratings relate to the lack of supporting legislation that is delaying the implementation of the new Customs Act compatible with the agreement and the latest best practices in Customs processes and procedures, it said. However, this new legislation, when passed, should enable a significant number of Category ‘C’ measures to be implemented and then re-rated to high Category ‘A’ status, ADB said. It further said that containers requiring regulatory controls are as high as 40 per cent of all imports, which is another negative.  In the current context, Sri Lanka Customs has no choice but to refer all such containers to examination yards for drawing samples by other regulatory agencies that have not been able to implement risk management within their procedures. Accordingly, it has become necessary to refer a higher number of consignments for examination merely to meet regulatory requirements, it said. In this connection, containers selected as high-risk cargo are between 10-12 per cent, while another five per cent of containers are classified as medium risk thereby meeting the intrusive examination requirements of Customs, the report further said.

The Magistrate gave this order following a request by Borella Police. He also ordered the Police to provide a report on phone call analysis related to the incident. Borella Police said, investigations were launched following a complaint made by the deceased’s wife and the investigations are yet to be concluded. Meanwhile, Borella Police also said according to the post-mortem, the victim died as a result of being strangled. The CID, along with Borella Police, has launched a full scale investigation into the brutal assault and murder of Schaffter at the Borella General Cemetery on Thursday (15). A Police Officer confirmed that besides these probes an inquiry was being carried out via the intelligence units as well. He stated statements have already been recorded into the murder from the wife of the victim, Tani Schaffter, an Executive of the firm, a few security officers deployed at the Cemetery and from two workers at the Cemetery. The Police Officer mentioned that the Police were also inspecting the electronic data of the motorcar, said to have been driven by deceased, the cell phone used by him along with the CCTV camera footage captured from the scene of the crime. According to Police, initial investigations into the incident had revealed that the victim had entered the Cemetery alone through its main gate. Police pointed out that three years ago the late Dinesh Schaffter had provided a sum of Rs 4 billion to a popular cricket commentator for a business venture. Police mentioned that following a disagreement between the two over the financial transaction, the deceased had even lodged three complaints against the commentator with the CID in the recent past. According to investigators the victim had informed his wife and an Executive from his firm that he was heading to meet the cricket commentator and he had left his residence at Flower Road, Cinnamon Gardens in Colombo at around 1.30 p.m. on 15 December. The victim’s wife had then rung the former, after a while, on his cell phone but the phone had been switched off. Police stated that after a while the cell phone used by Schaffter’s wife had received a signal indicating the presence of her husband at the Borella General Cemetery. Acting swiftly the victim’s wife had sent an Executive officer from her husband’s firm to the Cemetery. Upon reaching the location the Executive officer had noticed the deceased had been tied with his hands on the driving seat while his neck had been tied up with a zip tie. Noticing that even at that time his boss had been unconscious the Executive officer had alerted a labourer at the Cemetery and had proceeded to untie the victim after which he had been admitted to the Accident Service of the Colombo National Hospital (CNH). A hospital spokesman stated that the time had been around 5.15 p.m. The victim had then been promptly admitted to the ICU of the CNH, but after battling for survival for a few hours a hospital source stated that Dinesh Scahafter had succumbed to his injuries at around 10.30 p.m. At the time of his untimely demise the deceased had been a 51-year-old father of two. A top Police Officer, involved in the investigation, told this paper that a certain organised group, acting on a well coordinated plan, had managed to entice the victim to the General Cemetery after which they had proceeded to murder him in a brutal manner. Further investigations are conducted by the CID and the Borella Police. BY Hansi Nanayakkara, Bimal Shyaman Jayasinghe –Colombo and Adnan Ali Cassim"

This is when the Petitions were taken before a Supreme Court Bench comprising Justices Priyantha Jayawardena, K. Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Achala Vengappuli. The petitions were filed by MPs Dayasiri Jayasekara, Lakshman Kiriella, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, M.A. Sumanthiran, Ranjith Madduma Bandara and G.L. Pieris, instructed by Attorney-at-Law Sandun Gamage. The Petitioners state that elections, under and in terms of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance No.53 of 1946, were last held in Sri Lanka on 10 February 2018 in respect of approximately 340 Local Authorities comprising approximately 24 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 275 Pradeshiya Sabhas (Divisional Councils). They stated that save for the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha in the Galle District, in respect of which a fresh poll was taken in or about October 2019, all the other Local Authorities in the Country were duly constituted in the year 2018, in consequence of the said election held in February 2018. The Petitioners state that the respective four-year terms of such Local Authorities, or more precisely, the four-year term of office of each Member of such Local Authority, was to stand expired by operation of Law, in terms of the provisions of the respective Laws governing such Local Authorities, in or about March 2023. They said however, acting in terms of the powers vested in him by the relevant Laws governing such Local Authorities, the then Minister in charge of the subject of Local Authorities, by Orders published in Government Gazette Extraordinary bearing No.2262/8 dated 1001-2022, extended the said term until 19 March 2023. The Petitioners note that it is not permissible in Law, for the Minister, to order any further extensions of the said term, and accordingly, the new term of office of duly elected Members to each such Local Authority shall commence on 20 March 2023. They further state that accordingly, it was incumbent for the Election Commission to take steps in terms of the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance No.53 of 1946, as amended, to conduct elections in respect of each such Local Authority – the term of office of the Members, adding however that it has been neglected to date. They said thereby that an irreparable loss will be caused to the people and to the petitioners by an indefinite postponement beyond 30 March 2023. Among other relief, they prayed Court to grant and issue an interim order, directing the Election Commission to take steps to publish the notices of intention to hold elections to all Local Authorities and set in motion, the election process for the said Local Authorities.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/12/17/highest-bidder-earmarked-for-coal-supply/,Highest bidder earmarked for coal supply?,Author not found,0,2022-12-16T20:50:00+00:00," As corruption is seen as a reason behind the current fuel and financial crises, it is unclear why the Ministry of Power and Energy that invited bids from prospective coal suppliers, for the 900MW Lakvijaya Coal Fired Power Plant at Norochcholai, which came to a close on 1 December, has failed to pick a supplier as yet. It is suspected that the delay is aimed at offering  coal supply to the highest bidder, which is ‘Coral Energy DMCC, Emirates’ that quoted USD 259 per MT with freight, outstripping the other lowest bids, Ceylon Today reliably learns. The Energy Ministry received nine bids for coal supply and chose the four lowest bids. However, the Ministry is alleged to have earmarked the highest bidder among them, in this case, Coral Energy DMCC, Emirates, which had quoted USD 259 per MT with freight, while the lowest bidder was CMEC – Browns Joint Venture Company, which quoted USD 230 per MT with freight. China Aero Supply (Singapore) Pte Ltd had quoted its bid at USD 233 per MT with freight, followed by Concept Global at USD 240 per MT with freight. Out of the four bids only two have offered credit facilities as per the Government’s request and the Coral Energy Company is not one among them, according to reliable sources. The delay in selecting the final bidder is at the outset when the technical evaluation of the final four has been conducted. Also, the Special Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee that evaluated the bids, later forwarded it to the Cabinet a week ago for approval. The Cabinet immediately recommended to select the awardee for coal supply. Already, the Cabinet has awarded the Coral Energy DMCC Company a long-term contract for importing diesel for an eight-month period that ended in October of this year.  It is alleged that the priority is given to ‘Coral Energy’, and the delay is to ensure that the other bidders leave the bidding because of long vacation period for the country’s legal body and the legal contract cannot be signed thereby. At this point, industry experts are also wondering why there is such a delay in selecting the lowest bidder when coal is running out and the monsoon season is approaching. Energy experts are also unsure who will bear responsibility if the required stock of coal for next year, up to September, is not brought into the country by April 2024. Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera and the Energy Ministry Secretary were both unavailable for comment. The Ministry Secretary’s is currently overseas. The Ministry of Power and Energy advertised proposals from prospective coal suppliers for the supply of coal for the 900MW Lakvijaya Coal Fired Power Plant Norochcholai in Sri Lanka based on the direction given by the Cabinet of Ministers in November 2022. The advertisement noted that the interested coal suppliers are free to submit their proposals for the supply of an estimated quantity of 720,000 ±10% MT of coal with a quality of 6150 kcal per kg, on a credit basis as specified in the Lanka Coal Company (Private) Limited, that is incorporated under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 consequent to a decision of Cabinet Ministers to procure and supply coal for coal-fired thermal plants of Sri Lanka. According to the advertisement published recently, the delivery period of the above quantity of coal, to Puttalam Anchorage, shall be from January 2023 of End of April 2023. Therefore, suppliers are allowed to submit their proposals to supply coal on a credit basis/deferred payment mechanism/or any other payment terms instead of requesting to provide either Sovereign and Treasury guarantees or confirmed or any form of a letter of credit issued by the international commercial bank.

Ceylon Today, through RTI application, obtained details from the Ministry of Finance – Department of External Resources and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) as both Ministries had dealt with the developing and leasing of the Hambantota Port to the Chinese Government. Based on the RTI, the Phase 1 of the Hambantota Port development incurred USD 447 million obtained from Exim Bank China, while, the SLPA had spent Rs 5,862 million. The first phase was initiated on 18 November 2010 and it was completed in 2017. Thereafter, in 2017 the GoSL, unable to repay the debt taken from CHEC, offered the Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease to Chinese company known as China Merchant Port Holding Company Limited and the Finance Ministry took over finance dealings from Sri Lanka Ports Authority and still continues to pay the developers – the CHEC, though their General Treasury. The GoSL failed to settle the old loan taken for the development even after it was leased for 99 years for 1.4 billion and that led the government to still pay the initial loan. According to the RTI obtained from the SLPA, they are not carrying out the repaying of the Hambantota port loan based on the decisions taken by the Cabinet of Ministers. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The grant contract was signed on the previous day Wednesday (30 November) between Ambassador of Japan Hideaki Mizukoshi and Country Director of MAG Cristy McLennan. This ‘new’ project is expected to clear 259,464 square metres of land in the Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Trincomalee Districts, making current mine contaminated areas safe lands for internally displaced people and directly or indirectly enhancing the livelihoods of 7,424 people, it said. Further, through such Japanese assistance, this is the 14th demining project implemented by MAG, the Embassy said. The previous 13 projects have released over 2,965,949 square metres of land and removed more than 15,831 landmines and other explosive ordnance, it said. This year also marks MAG’s 20th anniversary of launching demining activities in Sri Lanka. Since the beginning of Sri Lanka Mine Action programme in 2002, Japan has been a major donor in the area of mine clearance, the Embassy said. More than $ 43.3 million in assistance was rendered towards this cause through Japan’s Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Project (GGP), it said.  Commenting on the provision of this grant, McLennan said, “MAG is honoured to accept this grant from the GoJ, an esteemed donor for Humanitarian Mine Action projects both within Sri Lanka and around the world. In the last eight years alone, the partnership between MAG Sri Lanka and the GoJ has enabled the removal and destruction of nearly 16,000 landmines. It has helped many people resettle and rebuild their lives and livelihoods in Mannar, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee and Vavuniya districts through its clearance operations. The funding from the People of Japan will not only contribute to saving lives but also building safer futures for the mine-affected and poorest communities in the country. With this continued Japanese support, MAG is looking forward to continuing clearance activities towards the final stage of landmine release in country in support of the Government of Sri Lanka’s commitment to being mine free.” (PA)"

This was confirmed by the 13-member PTS. The Task Force was appointed by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to make recommendations for the implementation of the ‘One Country, One Law’ concept in Sri Lanka. The Government halted the study, indicating that the recommendations will not be adopted. Because the project cost the Government Rs 4.3 million, it is appropriate to educate the public about the research. Weerawardhanalage Sumedha Manjula, a PTS member, said Rs 4.3 million was spent on the ‘One Country, One Law’ Task Force, on the rent of the BMICH office premises, the printing of the Report and annexures, and other costs during the Task Force’s eight-month tenure. Ceylon Today specifically requested the Government through RTI to provide details pertaining to the question “how much each of the 13-member PTS was paid for this job,” to which the Presidential Secretariat failed to provide Ceylon Today with the necessary information. “As a member of the aforementioned Task Force, I believe it is critical in the interests of accountability and justice to the mission they carried out,” said Sumedha Manjula. He said members of the Task Force didn’t receive any remuneration, allowance, or reimbursement (including travel expenses) of any kind whatsoever in the performance of any of the duties of the Task Force. “I must specifically mention that several of our fellow members from Jaffna and various other districts travelled to Colombo and numerous other areas to perform their duties and bore their individual expenses entirely.” It must further be noted, he added, that although they were officially entitled to perks, the Secretary and other staff members who were appointed to this PTS did not obtain any additional remuneration or allowance in performing their official duties for the Task Force. On the report and recommendations of the ‘One Country, One Law’ Task Force, Ceylon Today learns that the Thesavalamai law and Kandyan law had little representation while more attention was paid on the abolishment of the Muslim law. There was strong opposition from the Muslim community to abolishing Muslim law. It was the Sufi community that came forward to bring about changes in the Muslim law, but they were under severe threats even to call for the Fatwa law to be abolished, Ceylon Today reliably learns. The report recommends the Fatwa law to be abolished. It was also highlighted that the Muslim member in the PTS refused to sign the recommendations related to the abolition of Muslim law. The Sufi community members met the PTS in Kattankudy as well as at the office at the BMICH. According to sources, the expert committee suggested repealing the Thesavalamai and Kandyan laws. That recommendation came based on the literature and media sources, which assisted the experts in formulating the recommendations. The expert committee also agreed that homosexuality should be decriminalised. No members of the LGBT community were present to discuss the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Sri Lanka. Politicians and political groups such as Pivithuru Hela Urumaya advocated for pardoning both LTTE members and government personnel involved in the Eelam conflict and it was recommended to pardon both the troops and the LTTE members who are under detention. The ‘One Country, One Law’ Task Force also recommends amending Parliament Elections Act No. 1 of 1981 by prohibiting the registration or continuance of political parties which base their activities on ethnic, religious, and regional grounds. On completing its mandate, the Task Force comprised the following members: Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera (Chairman), Prof. Shanti Nandana Wijesinghe, Senior Lecturer Weerawardhanalage Sumedha Manjula, Dr. N.G.

He specified that the CCYIA will work with the Embassy to promote Sri Lanka at cruise-related conferences. Dr. Kohona responded that the Embassy will also assist with these goals actively. Sri Lanka has three well-established ports for cruise ships: Colombo, Galle, and Trincomalee. He stated that there were many cruise visitors from Europe before the pandemic, and recently welcomed the cruise ship’ VIKING MARS’ with 900 tourists on board. He highlighted that other European cruise ships are scheduled to call at Sri Lanka ports in the coming weeks. The Ambassador suggested that tourists could experience not only the coastal cities but also the Buddhist Sites of the island, like the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy, or the lush green forests, home to the biggest concentrations of wild elephants and leopards in Asia.

This is at the outset where the Government is looking for an international investor to take over a 49 per cent stake in each of the State-run SriLankan Airlines’ catering and ground-handling units in efforts to restructure SriLankan. The salary of the pilots was over 55 per cent till December last year and now, because the cap the government has placed on the US Dollar conversion, they are only getting 60 cents to the US Dollar when they convert their contractual US Dollar salary to rupees every month. According to the Pilots’ Guild, there is already a Labour Commission ruling that the pay cut that is subjected to the pilots was illegal and the company owes the pilots back-pay. The total cadre (pilots) is less than 240 already and they have begun to pack their bags to leave, inside sources said. “Quite a few have quit flying altogether too. That number excludes the pilots leaving, sources said. Already flights are starting to get cancelled, a pilot told Ceylon Today. Among those leaving, some have quit for good and others have joined several other international airlines according to the Pilots’ Guild.  “With the new tax and the horrible way the company is treating us, everyone has had enough,” a senior pilot told this newspaper. The pilots said SriLankan should recruit right now but the Cabinet hasn’t given the go-ahead. They also questioned: “Recruit from where, from Expats? Who’s going to come and work here now for these salaries? And what about the tax? If the company pays their taxes which is what it did before, that’s a huge cost. According to them, all these happenings are due to gross negligence and mismanagement Ceylon Today reliably learns that when their grievances were tabled to the SriLankan Chairman Ashok Pathirage, he had told them to leave if they want to. “He said so in 2020 when pilots reminded him about the contractual salaries not being paid to them for over a year. It is alleged that Pathirage had said that he can find pilots and the pilots blamed the whole exodus on the Head of Human Resources, Buddhika Manage, who had declined to support their grievances. “It’s the top people who are the reason for many as 100 odd pilots leaving, noted inside sources. Even if expats come to pilot the airline, we’ll only attract the rif-raf now with these packages.” And they’ll also come just for a year to regain flying currency, for instance, if they’re flown for a national carrier and join airlines like Qatar, Etihad or Emirates. Then what’s the threat to our safety record, when we get those types of pilots, lamented the pilots. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Speaking in Parliament on Friday (25) Minister Wijesekera said if the PUCSL had increased electricity tariffs to cover the generation cost from 2013, people would not have undergone a huge tariff hike at once.

Sri Lanka, in the recent past, was caught in the middle of geopolitics of power centres due to its sensitive location in the Indian Ocean Region. Senior Adviser to the President on National Security, Sagala Ratnayake, has taken steps to implement this new SOP for security forces to use in making decisions about security aircraft and ships arriving in Sri Lanka. This new operating procedure has been prepared by top military brass and senior officers of the Attorney General’s Department and will be implemented in the near future. When the Chinese research vessel Yuan Wang 5 arrived in this country, it was labelled as a spy vessel, resulting in a diplomatic crisis. India protested the vessel’s arrival in Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan Government later resolved the issue through negotiations with China and India. Following this incident, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, has directed Ratnayake and the Security Forces to immediately prepare a Standard Operating Procedure in this regard. It will be decided, on the basis of this new SOP, whether to accept security ships and aircraft arriving in Sri Lanka to avoid diplomatic confrontations. Last week, Ratnayake met the Security Chiefs and Officers from the Attorney General’s Department at the Presidential Secretariat to discuss this issue. He brought up the relevant SOP during that discussion. The Security Forces will take decisions about military planes and ships coming to Sri Lanka based on that operating system. By Gagani Weerakoon"

Foreign Minister Ali Sabry told Ceylon Today, that so far there had been no conversation on this matter and no one contacted the Sri Lankan mission in Chennai about any of those released prisoners wanting to come to Sri Lanka, but a team has been appointed to study the matter and how to deal with the situation if they want to return. The four Sri Lankan nationals, who spent 31 years in prison, were moved to a special camp in Tamil Nadu by the Indian Government as soon as they were released from prison on 12 November because they were foreign nationals and there is a process in expatriating them. Foreign Minister Sabry said, “We have appointed a team to study the process in case they want to return to Sri Lanka.” The Supreme Court of India released seven convicts who were initially sentenced to death and then commuted it to life in prison because of their good behaviour and as long serving prisoners of 31 years in Tamil Nadu. One of the released individuals Nalini Sriharan who is married to a Sri Lankan namely Sriharan alias Murugan said, she does not want her husband to return to Sri Lanka however, she would request the Sri Lankan High Commission to issue an ‘emergency passport’ for her husband so that both of them could travel to the United Kingdom where their daughter is residing. The other Sri Lankans are Jayakumar, Robert Pius and Santhan who are currently in a special camp undecided where they would go. Nalini told the Tamil Nadu Press that it is only Santhan who wanted to return to Sri Lanka however, she also pointed out that the current crisis in the country has led to many Sri Lankans to take the boats rides to enter Tamil Nadu and in this context she would not advice to send anyone to Sri Lanka. It is speculated the Indian Government would first find out whether the four men would want to return to Sri Lanka or go elsewhere. If there is interest to return to Sri Lanka the two governments would liaise  on the process it would involve and Sri Lanka would take it stance what to do with those who return after being convicted for being part of the assassination plot of Rajiv Gandhi.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Ranasinghe said the investigation that has already been launched regarding the men’s national team will also look into the matter. Speaking to Ceylon Today, Ranasinghe said these requests have been made based on arguments on social media that being a member of certain religious groups is a basic requirement to be on the national cricket team. The Minister said among these insistences is that a person called Jerome Fernando, who appears as a person with ‘divine power’ had allegedly made a prediction about the results of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup tournament including physical injuries of Sri Lankan players. It is alleged that Fernando had made certain predictions during his sermons at the juncture of the Sri Lankan team winning three of the four matches and lost only one match in the tournament, are suspicious. He told devotees that five players will suffer physical injuries and further showed how one of them will suffer a leg injury while bowling. The video of his speech delivers in a hall called ‘The Miracle Dome’ on 23 October was later uploaded on his official Facebook page claiming how he had predicted the team’s exit from the tournament in advance. Suspicions have been raised with regard to certain statements he made during the sermon. According to the video, he claimed with the fulfilment of ‘prophecy’ about the ICC Men’s Asian Cup last September, many people who do not believe in prophecies thought that ‘God’s approach’ on the T20 World Cup would be the same. He said he would not tell that Sri Lanka would win the T20 World Cup. “If I say Sri Lanka will win….but I won’t say that.” After that he started to tell devotees about a ‘problem’ that the team would have to face when Sri Lanka Cricket website only reported about injuries of two players, Dushmantha Chameera and Danushka Gunathilaka. He told five players would suffer from physical injuries, according to ‘what God showed him.’ He even showed how a bowler would sustain an injury, while bowling just like the way Binura Fernando had to leave the ground. When devotees requested him to ‘pray’ for the country’s victory he said, “How many people expect Sri Lanka to do well in this World Cup? But I don’t say that. The World Cup is already over.” After Sri Lanka won the Asia Cup, Jerome Fernando made a similar statement and said that he was behind that victory. Banuka Rajapaksa, who played an outstanding innings in the final match, also participated in the event. Jerome Fernando called him on stage and blessed him and explained his ‘involvement’ in it. There have been long-term criticisms about Sri Lankan cricket and certain religious cults on social media. The questions and suspicions have been intensified now, asking why only cricket has become a ‘concern of God’. It is also alleged that most of the key positions in the Sri Lankan cricket team and in the administration are under the authority of a certain religious cult. The Minister further said even though Sri Lankan cricket has to start from scratch, there will be a transparent and impartial investigation into these allegations and he expects President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s attention would be drawn to this matter as well.

In response to these comments, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, Leo Docherty, pointed out that within its governance structure, the IMF only has the ability to impose conditionality linked to economic policy, not political or human rights-linked conditionality. “But of course we want human rights progress to advance in tandem with economic progress, and we will use other mechanisms to hold the Sri Lankans to account and progress human rights in that regard,” he added. Docherty also said, “The UK and Sri Lanka have had a long shared history. Many UK citizens and parliamentarians have close ties with that country; we have heard Members speak movingly of their experiences in Sri Lanka. The relationship really does matter to the UK and it has been extremely difficult for us all to witness Sri Lanka’s recent economic decline. It is an economic crisis made worse by dreadful and long-term mismanagement, the economic fallout from the terrible 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, the Covid pandemic and Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. “As for what the British Government is doing about this, we believe that a stable and inclusive political settlement is an essential foundation for economic recovery and growth in the long term in Sri Lanka. Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon made that point to Sri Lankan President Wickremesinghe in July and to Sri Lankan Prime Minister Gunawardena in August, urging progress both on human rights and accountability, and on economic reform.” The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State added that the UK will continue to call on Sri Lanka to make progress on human rights and accountability. “We will continue to work with international partners to hold the Government of Sri Lanka to their promises. We have supported efforts to promote human rights and peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka for many years. “In October, we worked with partners in the UN to agree the new resolution on Sri Lanka — resolution 51/L1—which has been mentioned many times today, to extend the mandate to report on the realities on the ground and to preserve and protect evidence of past human rights violations and abuses for future accountability processes. “This international framework ensures that Sri Lanka remains on the international human rights agenda and we believe that this diplomatic approach is the best way to encourage progress. However, we recognise that sincere and sustainable progress on human rights and accountability must be led by the people of Sri Lanka. Over the past three years we have spent more than £10 million from our conflict, stability and security fund to support peace building, social cohesion and gender equality, as well as to strengthen democratic institutions. Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon met Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry in September to urge progress and to renew our offer to work with Sri Lanka. “A number of right hon. and hon. Members have mentioned sanctions. The Government would not speculate from the Dispatch Box on possible designations, since that would reduce their impact, but we keep all evidence and potential listings under close review. “To conclude, the people of Sri Lanka are experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis and they continue to face violations of human rights and barriers to justice. In response to the economic situation, the UK Government have provided direct humanitarian assistance and financial support through multilateral institutions, and we continue to pursue options for debt relief through all of this, ensuring that the poorest and most vulnerable continue to receive support at this time is critical. “We will continue to support the Sri Lankan people in their pursuit of justice and accountability and of progress on human rights, including at the UN Human Rights Council. Sri Lanka is an important and valued friend of the United Kingdom, and this Government will do all we can to help the Sri Lankan people to achieve the prosperous and peaceful future they deserve.”"

Quotations had been called in June 2019. However, the Health Secretary will not be able to launch a probe into the purchase of 1,563 ampoules of the Papaverine hydrochloride 60 mg 10 millilitre injection with an Auditor General’s investigation ongoing, he said. The Auditor General’s Department recommended a formal investigation into the purchasing of 1,563 ampoules of the injection at a cost of Rs 40,869 each when it could have been purchased at Rs 255. The injection is used to improve blood circulation in patients with circulatory problems. Papaverine is used to produce erections in some men with erectile dysfunction. Meanwhile, Secretary of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Haritha Aluthge said, his outfit had written to the Health Secretary urging him to call for a stakeholder meeting and explain as to how a database which had been prepared by the Colombo University Computer Section will be used. Dr. Aluthge stressed on the need of setting up a properly functioning database unlike the one which was set up at an exorbitant cost only to be dysfunctional. Lambasting the Health Ministry and its authorities, he said it was highly unlikely that Sri Lanka will run properly even if the Government and the Health Ministry got the money under such conditions.  The country has over 1,000 hospitals, but even the dysfunctional database which was set up at a very high cost has not encompassed all of them. “The network includes only base hospitals, while district hospitals and central dispensaries were not included in the network.” This feat cannot be achieved manually, he observed, adding that there were over 2,000 medicinal drugs and 8,000 types of surgical instruments.     By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Those freed are, Nalini Sriharan, R.P. Ravichandran, Santhan, Murugan, Robert Payas and Jayakumar. The Bench, comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and BV Nagarathna, passed the order while taking into consideration the case of A.G. Perarivalan, another convict who was released in May. Nalini, who is currently out on parole, had moved the apex court seeking early release from prison after the Madras High Court turned down her plea. Her petition was filed after the Supreme Court on 18 May ordered the release of Perarivalan, who had served more than 30 years in jail, by exercising its special powers under the Constitution’s Article 142. The Article enables the top Court to pass orders to ensure “complete justice” in a case.  Nalini cited Perarivalan’s case as she sought similar relief. Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was killed by an LTTE suicide bomber at an election meeting in Tamil Nadu’s Sriperumbudur on 21 May 1991. Seven convicts were sentenced to life terms in the case. In 1999, the Supreme Court sentenced four of them to death and the other three to life imprisonment. In 2000, the death sentence of Nalini was commuted to life. In 2014, the Supreme Court commuted the other three death sentences, including that of Perarivalan. (The Indian Express)"

He added that such shortages today were caused by a lack of proper management in those departments. “The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank funded the purchase of medical accessories, which are currently in short supply. We have enough US dollars to buy medicines. If the order to purchase medicines is not placed on time, we will not receive them by the expected date,” Ratnapriya explained. “If order was placed for certain medicines, it will take more than three months for the manufacturers to dispatch the consignment. For instance, when we place an order with medicinal drug manufacturers in India they will start the manufacturing process after receiving the order,” according to Ratnapriya. “The prevailing economic crisis in the country has severely impacted the health sector and other sectors. However, the health sector was making a great effort to provide satisfactory service to the people, as far as it possibly could. We have enough of 14 varieties of essential medicines in stock,” Ratnapriya said. Ratnapriya claimed that up to now no patient died in Sri Lanka due to the shortage of medicine. He said that certain planned surgeries were postponed and expressed confidence that those surgeries will be performed soon.     By Naalir Jamaldeen"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/11/12/covid-wanes-as-monkeypox-enters-sri-lanka/,COVID WANES AS MONKEYPOX ENTERS SRI LANKA,Author not found,0,2022-11-11T20:30:00+00:00," With a total of 671,369 Covid-19 cases reported by 10 November 2022, two imported cases of monkeypox are receiving treatment at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) amid a drug shortage as Sri Lanka tries to look at the silver lining on the dark cloud through a tunnel. China’s Covid-19 situation According to the latest news, coronavirus cases are increasing in China’s Guangzhou Province and other cities. Reports say that the manufacturing hub is becoming the latest Covid-19 “epicentre”. New locally transmitted infections climbed over 7,400 on 7 November, according to China’s health authority, up from 5,496 the day before and the highest since 1 May 2022. It said that Guangzhou had accounted for a sizable portion of the new infections. However, the increase had been modest by global standards although significant for China. Economically important cities, like capital Beijing, are said to be calling for more PCR tests for residents and locking down neighbourhoods and districts in some cases. Foreign reports said that the sharp rebound would test China’s ability to keep its Covid measures surgical and targeted, and could “dampen investors’ hopes that the world’s second-largest economy could ease curbs and restrictions soon.” In unfortunate parallels, Sri Lanka with its suffering economy is unable to even afford another surge of the pandemic taking its toll on the island. Lifting restrictions It is true that the island cannot go to the extremes it went through during 2020 and 2021 with self-imposed lockdowns and strict travel guidelines even a fly couldn’t arrive from abroad to rest on Sri Lankan soil. Hence it has been with some fear and optimism that locals have watched the almost ad-hoc lifting of travel guidelines. At onetime health authorities and the armed forces went through a song and dance each time travel restrictions were lifted locally as the general public were prone to congregate and make merry even during the shortest timespan when lockdowns were lifted.  Travel guidelines issued to foreign travellers arriving in Sri Lanka were relaxed keeping in accordance with the demands of the Minister of Tourism, a particularly high profile MP and officials of the Ministry of Tourism. Nobody’s Child Travel guidelines which were issued for passengers arriving from abroad during the Covid-19 pandemic seemed to have been formulated by several sections of the Health Ministry. While the Deputy Director General (Public Health Services- DDG PHS)-II whose department was known to have formulated them initially seems to have no clue as to who else had been involved in the preparation of the document. However the DDG seemed to only prefer addressing press briefings rather than respond to one on one queries as to what the current situation was. The ball being passed on to the Ministry’s Quarantine Unit too was unable to shed light on the matter as its Acting Director was at a “meeting”. However she was allegedly incompetent and had almost bungled up overtime payments of Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) at the Bandaranaike International Airport during the height of the pandemic so much so that they threatened to withdraw their services. Relatives of a patient who had died while receiving treatment abroad said the particular Acting Director Quarantine had allegedly delayed even the release of a dead body which had arrived at the airport owing to this inaptitude. What the Ceylon Today could glean was that only two specific factors remained from the sheets and guidelines formulated just two years ago. 1. People should wear a mask while in closed spaces or travelling in public transport. 2. All Sri Lankans and foreign nationals arriving from overseas should be vaccinated against Covid-19.  Depending on the PCR test result, which passengers were expected to do 72 hours before boarding the flight, those arriving in Sri Lanka did not have to go through the long and tedious hours of quarantine once they landed.  The show must go on with border surveillance With  two cases of monkeypox that have been diagnosed from two persons arriving from abroad and the  warnings issued by the College of Community Physicians and the Epidemiology Unit that more cases of the pock disease could be expected from abroad, the country has no other option but to move on ahead. Sri Lankans would also have to hope that the Maritime Declaration of Health, Copy of Crew and passenger list with signed on day and place and last port of visit within 14 days would help ensure that none of these viruses would arrive by sea.  Knowing how Sri Lankans working abroad during the Covid-19 situation having taken Paracitamol to fool the thermal scanners, locals would have to depend on the good will and compassion of those arriving in the country to prevent a strain of the Covid virus or Monkeypox virus from spreading in the country. Mercifully, the two patients with Monkeypox who arrived in the country were intelligent and considerate enough to seek treatment for their condition.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

At present, Sri Lanka has around 30,000 apartment blocks including private apartments, government servants’ housing schemes, etc. Around 7,750 apartment units are managed by 968 condominium management corporations registered under the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA). The official function was held at the BOI Auditorium under the patronage of State Minister of Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama, BOI Director General Renuka M. Weerakone, Controller General of Department of Immigration I.S.H.J. Ilukpitiya and other officials. Under the new visa scheme, the condominium property purchasing individuals and companies will be granted a long-term residence visa considering the investment remitted and the value of purchasing the property. This scheme will be targeted to promote the selling of condominiums/apartments to foreign nationals who wish to live in Sri Lanka. Individuals who invest USD 200,000 in an urban area condominium are eligible for a 10-year long-term visa scheme, while those who invest USD 150,000 in an urban area condominium are eligible for five years. Further, investors who invest USD 75,000 in suburban area condominiums are also eligible for five years. On the other hand, companies that invest USD 500,000 in an urban area condominium are eligible for a five-year long-term visa scheme, while companies that invest USD 500,000 in a suburban area condominium are also eligible for a five-year long-term visa scheme. Furthermore, the number of apartment units completed by the BOI is approximately 5,000, ranging from low-cost units to semi-luxury to super luxury. It is also noteworthy that apart from the local investors, several countries have also shown interest in developing condominium projects and real estate developments in Sri Lanka. Besides, the majority of condominium buyers were Sri Lankan residents, while there is a present trend of purchasing condominium units by dual citizens and foreigners. In conclusion, the BOI hopes the new system will curb inconveniences the investors/enterprises face and further strengthen the digital transformation of work with the respective line agencies and ministries.

The fee for Flight Information Region (FIR) or flying in Sri Lankan airspace and adjacent oceanic airspace under the Regional Air Navigation Plan of Asia and Pacific Regions remains the same as under  Section 24 and Section (3) (2) (pp) of the Air Navigation Act and the Gazette number 147/12 of 3 July 1981. On 12 November 2019, it was agreed in accordance with Section 117, which grants the Minister of Civil Aviation the authority to make regulations while taking the needs of the National Economy into account. However, around at that time, the 2019 Presidential Election took place, and the succeeding ministers who took over the relevant portfolios seem to have either ignored the matter or were uninformed about it. All that was left to be done was for the incumbent Minister to sign a new Gazette with those revisions and make it official. The FIR is a provision of air traffic services introduced in 1981 and the amount at that time was declared to be between USD 100 to USD 250 per day. Currently, the FIR charges annually generate around USD 7,848,000 according to the CAASL, while the revised fee could have earned better than what it is now. The present charges for Airbus and Boeing aircraft:  A320 – USD 100; B763- USD 150; A330 – USD200; B777 – USD 250; B747 – USD 250 and for A380 – USD 250. The proposed revised FIR charges for the same aircraft were USD 169; USD 265; USD 332: USD 360; USD 384 and USD 464, respectively. Then Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Arjuna Ranatunga proposed the revised FIR charge, however, the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) claimed that the FIR was under Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd or the AASL, but they did not have a proper record of the income earned by the FIR. According to sources, the FIR revenue was “mixed up with other income and showed no clear picture of the revenue,” to which the Ministry of Civil Aviation drafted a proposal with the revised FIR fees and obtained approval through the Parliament in 2019. In aviation, a FIR is a specified region of airspace in which a flight information service and an alerting service (ALRS) are provided. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) delegates which country is responsible for the operational control of a given FIR. FIRs are the largest regular division of airspace in use in the world today and have existed at least since 1947. During this process, ICAO policies for determinations of air navigation charges were taken into account and they are mainly for the recovery of costs for the provision of air navigation facilities and services.

However, it was reported outside the endemic status – in the European and Americas from the third or fourth week of May. But, No cases have been reported from amongst the tourists who visited those countries during that period,” he explained. The first case of monkeypox was diagnosed by Sri Lankan Health Authorities in a person who had arrived from Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The 20-year-old Sri Lankan had returned to the island on Tuesday (1). The youth, had visited the STD Clinic (Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic) where test reports had shown that he had not contracted an STD. However, on suspicion the samples taken from the patient had been submitted to the Medical Research Institute (MRI), informed sources said.   Health sources said, the MRI had tested six suspected cases for monkeypox since setting up of the of real-time PCR assay since July 2022. They noted however that this had been the first laboratory-confirmed case of the disease’s presence in Sri Lanka. The Ministry also said, the zoonosis disease could spread through close contact. According to the WHO some cases have been identified through sexual health clinics in communities of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.

The selected contractor failed to finish the project by the deadline and there were several technical issues regarding the construction of this building. Finally, after several warnings the Ministry had to terminate the contract for valid reasons. After that the work did not continue until the media questioned the situation. Then, in 2021 the project was transferred to Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs. Then Navy was called in. In March 2021 the construction process was re-started. This time the construction part was awarded to the Navy. CECB is the Engineering consultant. The present government has released funds as and when requested. Now, 60 per cent of the building is complete and the work is steadily going forward. The Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural affairs is giving high priority to the project. Since the economic conditions are slowly improving and has come to a somewhat stable situation, CECB has estimated that the project will finish in another eight months."

Premajayantha reiterated that the Education Ministry will not entertain such requests. In response to a request made by the Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) to consider allowing female teachers to wear comfortable and suitable attire other than the Sari and the Osari, Premjayantha firmly noted that such decision cannot be taken considering the request of a single trade union and it does not represent the entire teacher community. He further said, allowing teachers to change their attire by letting them wear different styles may lead to a bad example to children where they will also want to follow numerous fashions and trends at school. When Ceylon Today spoke to Premajayantha, he noted that there is no need to change teacher attire and has a history predating Independence. “The Sari and Osari of school teachers are also another form of uniform which has been worn even before the Independence. Though teachers are from different ethnic groups they all wear the same attire respecting the culture of the country. This isn’t a practice that was only followed by female school teachers; even male principles of leading schools still wear the white coat or blazer when they attend school every day. I don’t see the purpose of the request made by this particular trade union leader, when that’s the attire used as the uniform for this profession for centuries now,” he added. He added, the Ministry have also got written requests from several OBA and OGA of schools not to change the current attire of female teachers. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

This (Booker Prize) should be a celebratory moment for Sri Lanka and its writers, he said. “A claim has been made by a journalist in Colombo that the plot of my novel, ‘The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida’ was ‘stolen’ from a 56-page untitled ‘novella’ that he sent to me in 2011 seeking an author’s endorsement. His claim is both baseless and insulting.  I have shared his email and the ‘novella’ manuscript with my lawyers who confirm that the claim of plagiarism is entirely unfounded and that the allegations made are libellous. I have also shared the ‘novella’ with my publishers – who confirm the texts bear no comparison whatsoever with my novel – there are no shared plots, characters nor text – and with the Booker Prize Foundation, so that they may be assured the claims are unfounded.   I am deeply concerned that journalists in Sri Lanka are passing on these unsupported and unfounded allegations. I would ask any journalist to demand to see the document on which these allegations are based,” he said.  Karunatilaka said he will make no further comment on the issue. "

In this manner they have been able to try and quash the President of the Medical and Civil Rights Association of Doctors (MCPA) Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa and initiate an investigation against the President of the Academy of Health Professionals,” Kumudesh said.   While President Ranil Wickremesinghe seems to hold the policies of the Lechchavi kings in high esteem, the Health Ministry and the Government prefers to initiate meaningless probes in a bid to coerce them into submission. Their only method of addressing issues is to initiate probes at ministry level or at the Police Department, he accused. The AHP President warned however that the unions would resort to trade union action should the Government and the Health Ministry continue this method of hiding the truth from the public. Health is a collaborative service. “The Ministry is accepting the reality from the facts which our unions revealed six months earlier, but are not ready to accept the reality of the facts which we are trying to tell them now,” he said observing that the Ministry would only do so in further six months.  The Public Services Commission approved the interdiction of the MCPA President.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Sri Lanka has been facing an acute shortage of foreign exchanges in recent times, which is why it has even faced difficulties in importing essential commodities. The CBSL has sent a circular to participant countries, including the Bangladesh Bank. Bangladesh Bank (BB) said, “In response to the self-motivated decision by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to remain temporarily suspended from the ACU mechanism with effect from 14 October 2022, all Authorized Dealers are advised not to do any trade and trade-related transactions with Sri Lanka through ACU mechanism.” The ACU is an arrangement through which participating countries settle import payments for intra-regional transactions. The ACU was established at the initiative of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). The primary objective of ACU, at the time of its establishment, was to secure regional cooperation in regards the settlement of eligible monetary transactions among the members of the Union, to provide a system for clearing payments among the member countries on a multilateral basis. Participants of the Asian Clearing Union include Bangladesh Bank, Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan, Reserve Bank of India, Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Maldives Monetary Authority, Central Bank of Myanmar, Nepal Rastra Bank, State Bank of Pakistan, and Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The participants permit the banks in their respective countries to maintain ACU dollar, ACU euro, and ACU yen accounts with their correspondent banks in the other participating countries. The central banks of these countries have to make payments every two months. The foundation of the Asian Clearing Union (ACU), with headquarters in Tehran, Iran, was laid on 9 December 1974.

He was of the view that guarantees for claims should be obtained before the wreck is removed.  He said that the removed wreck would be taken away by the P&I Club, the insurer of the X-Press Pearl vessel.  Dr. Gunasekera also said the wreck should be removed as it hampers the other fishing vessels coming along that route. “Hence, removal should be carried out, but before that a indemnity should be procured for the overall losses and future losses, arising from the Xpress Pearl fire, so that we may have a hold on to the enforceability of the claim once wreck disappears,” he added. An indemnity or guarantee for the pollution arising from wreck removal must separately be taken in favour of the Sri Lankan Government, so that any pollution arising from the removal may be enforced Also, the second indemnity mentioned above must have clauses to effect that the indemnity or guarantee is enforceable in Sri Lanka. These are the basics of maritime law he added. If the wreck is removed there is no chance of further prosecution for claims. Having the wreck in the Sri Lankan water, Marine Environment Protection Authority was able to only get a ‘charity’ amount for the fishermen and not for the marine pollution.   Already, the action is questionable because if the wreck is removed there is a possibility of losing both the pollution guarantee and overall guarantee for the overall payments over the losses.

This move could force thousands of employees, especially those in apparel sector, out of their jobs without any compensation from their employers, trade unions alleged. However, they have not taken any measures to do so, as an alternative Bill or an amendment to the existing Act has not been finalised yet. It is reported that an official statement in this regard will be made by the Ministry Secretary who refused to provide a statement whether the Act will be abolished, once the alternative amendments or the Act was finalised. “The Termination of Employment Act, which stipulates that even though an institution is closed down, it is not allowed to fire its employees. There is a systematic and transparent process which involves employers requesting permission from the Commissioner General of Labour Department to terminate the service of employees, in the event employees do not consent to be removed upon the closure of an institution with compensation. If the said Act is abolished, it will create huge job insecurity, as employers may be authorised to hire and fire employees freely,” Anton Marcus, the Joint Secretary of the Free Trade Zones and General Services Employees Union stressed.

MP Sumanthiran added that the Department of Archaeology was preventing Tamil farmers from cultivating on their ancestral lands in the Tennamaravadi and Thiriyai areas in the Trincomalee District. “The Department of Archaeology is confiscating lands of Tamils in the North too. The confiscation of aforesaid lands in the Trincomalee District is also a reflection of this move,” Sumanthiran said. The owners of those lands had obtained an Injunction Order from the High Court against the confiscation of their agricultural lands. The Court ruled that the Department shouldn’t prevent farmers from cultivating on their lands, Sumanthiran added. “The farmers were able to cultivate and reap the harvest in that year. Later, the farmers were prevented from cultivating there. The deeds are over 100 years old. So, those lands don’t belong to the Government. We have produced the deeds as evidence in Court.

It said, the reasons behind the bludgeoning of Sri Lanka’s economy this year were the combined effects of Covid-19 and the record-high commodity prices due to the war in Ukraine. The WB forecast the economy to grow by 1 per cent in 2024. Complementing these forecasts, the WB, in a document titled ‘Coping with Shocks: Migration and the Road to Resilience,’ released on Thursday further said, with the ongoing economic and balance of payments crises in Sri Lanka, tourism in the country is severely constrained by widespread shortages, and recent tourist arrivals are more than 60 per cent below the levels seen in 2019. “Business confidence, which captures a country’s overall economic conditions as perceived by businesses, has become increasingly pessimistic in Sri Lanka,” it added. Sri Lanka slipped deeper into crisis in June and July 2022, as the country’s agriculture, manufacturing, and services sectors are constrained by shortages of imported inputs and a general lack of confidence. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) shows that the country’s manufacturing sector has been contracting since June and the services sector since May, the WB said. Consistent with the weaknesses demonstrated in recent PMIs, data suggests continued contraction in Sri Lanka in the third quarter of the year, reflecting the collapse in demand due to the limited ability to import energy and essential goods, it warned. Limited harvests, higher transport costs, lack of fertilisers, and the inability to finance food imports as the country’s currency depreciated drastically and foreign reserves depleted, have all contributed to food shortages and skyrocketing food prices. By September 2022, 33 per cent of the population is estimated to have insufficient food consumption, compared to 17 per cent a year ago, the WB said. (PA)"

According to a complaint made by MP M.A. Sumanthiran regarding a defamatory video of MP R. Sampanthan, resulting in a violation of his privileges, the individual linked to the Facebook page, was summoned before the Committee on Ethics and Privileges recently. An investigation into the incident took place at the Committee on Ethics and Privileges, which met recently in Parliament under the chairmanship of Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. As the individual admitted to his fault, it was decided to settle the matter subject to conditions agreed to by both parties. Thus, the investigation concluded on the condition of publishing a statement in a well-known newspaper as well as on the Facebook page. The committee released him after a stern warning. The Chairman of the Committee pointed out that if a defamatory statement is made regarding an MP or Parliament in general, Parliament and the Supreme Court have the power to punish persons who do so under the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act. He pointed out that under the powers of Parliament, there is also the power to warn or ban entry into the Parliament premises for six months, and if the Committee on Ethics and Privileges decides that something offensive has been carried out, it can be referred to the Supreme Court. The Chairman further pointed out that if found guilty, the wrongdoer can be sentenced to a prison sentence of not more than two years or a fine or both. Meanwhile, two parliamentary correspondents of a leading Sinhala daily newspaper were also summoned before the Committee on Ethics and Privileges in connection with publishing false news that brought disrepute to all MPs. This complaint was made by MP Jayantha Ketagoda regarding a news item published in the newspaper on 9 March under the headline ‘Parliamentarians cause havoc in Parliament due to the short supply of liquid milk in the canteen.’ Ketagoda said through this false news, hatred has been created among the public towards the entire Parliament and its members. The Director of the Department of Catering and Housekeeping was also summoned before the committee and he said he had investigated the matter and no information about such incident was reported. Thus, the Chairman of the Committee pointed out that it appears that the publication of false information has damaged the honour of the entire Parliament, and senior journalists need to report more responsibly. Both parties agreed to resolve this issue without proceeding to judicial action. A statement expressing regret for the publication of this false information is to be published in the newspaper within two weeks, giving the same publicity as the false news, and a copy of it to be sent to the Secretary-General of Parliament within a week. The Chairman of the Committee further said this would be settled under the conditions of agreeing to refrain from publishing such false statements about Parliament or MPs in the future. The Chair also instructed to inform the Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper in writing to attend to this matter. Meanwhile, the Committee’s attention was also drawn to the complaint made against the CID in relation to the breach of privilege of obtaining the data of the ‘WhatsApp’ calls of Parliamentarian Patali Champika Ranawaka without legal permission. It was also mentioned here that the CID has obtained this data in relation to an investigation into a financial misappropriation that took place in the Ministry when the MP was a minister. Accordingly, the Director of the CID was summoned before the Committee on Ethics and Privileges on 18 October for further inquiry on this matter."

The SLMC is facing the dilemma of having only 30,000 doctors registered with it while there are 35,000 quacks who have no ethical or legal right to practice.  Unfortunately the SLMC can only take action against those registered with it. Action cannot be taken against the unregistered numbers over any misconduct or breaching of medical ethics, he said when contacted on Thursday (06). The SLMC has no power to deal with them.  A worried SLMC Registrar said that those who have followed other schools of medicine, those who have no Bachelor of Medicine Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degrees but perhaps work in other professions in the health service and even medical practitioners who have not renewed their registration with the Council after the lapse of five years – the stipulated time limit are considered as quacks. Meanwhile the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), which initiated a programme to bring this situation under control, said it had set up a ‘Quack Committee’ and introduced a hot line and a email through which its members could communicate the areas in which quacks were ‘practicing.’ The Union had also introduced a Google form through which they could obtain information regarding them. The doctors’ outfit said that it hoped to bring all stakeholders of this issue together for discussions. The stakeholders include the SLMC, the Ayurveda and Homeopathy Councils, the Attorney General Department, The Police, and the Health Ministry. It noted that a study would also have to be carried out on sections of the penal code, the Cosmetic Devices and Drug Act, the National Medicines Regulatory Act, Medical Ordinance and the Criminal Procedure Code amongst them before holding discussions. “It is unfortunate that the SLMC has not been able to amend the Medical Ordinance even after 2018 to introduce legal strictures to curtail this issue which poses a serious threat to the lives of the public, the SLMC noted.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The respondents were of the position that the Petitioners have no legal standing to file the application but the Court held that when considering the protection of the interests of the children and the constitutional powers vested upon the Supreme Court, members of the School Development Society have a right to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on the infringement of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Article 12(1) of the Constitution on behalf of the students of Talawakelle Tamil Maha Vidyalaya. The Petitioners argued that according to a letter, the Respondents have agreed to relocate the school and rebuild the facilities and considered the said document as the initial agreement to the proposed plan of the constructions. They observed however, that the Project Director, Upper Kotmale Hydro Power Project and the CEB have neglected or failed to construct the Auditorium as agreed, and that such conduct is arbitrary, irrational and unreasonable. It was further noted by the Petitioners that the respondents deviated from the promise to construct the Auditorium due to political involvement of the Ceylon Workers’ Congress (CWC) thereby complaining that the fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1) had been violated is based on the concept of legitimate expectation as they had such an expectation that the respondents would construct the Auditorium building as promised in order to continue proper education of the students of Talawakelle Tamil Maha Vidyalaya. Thus, the Court directed the CEB to construct the Auditorium as promised. BY Faadhila Thassim"

A complaint, by way of a Private Plaint, was filed under and in terms of Section 136 (1) (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 (as amended) before the Fort Magistrate on 16 September, alleging that Sirisena had failed to order the arrest of Zaharan Hashim and his followers, to oversee their arrest, to prevent the murder of those who do not profess the Islamic faith thus resulting in omissions in terms of the Penal Code. Oral submissions were made on behalf of the Complainants and the Fort Magistrate made an order issuing summons on Sirisena requiring him to be present before the Fort Magistrate’s Court on 14 of October 2022. Sirisena,through the Writ Application observed that the Magistrate has failed to exercise his discretion properly in deciding to issue summons and has erred in law in acting upon hearsay. It was noted that the Magistrate has acted on inadmissible material and that the Complainants have willfully misrepresented facts and as such the Fort Magistrate has misdirected himself on the material facts and that Complainants have willfully suppressed material fact, mainly that there was a State Minster of Defence overlooking the Department of the Police and the Armed Forces and Intelligence agencies during the relevant period. He further noted that the Attorney General, in issuing summons had failed to judicially evaluate the legal requisites of a complaint filed by a private individual prior to the issuance of summons. Sirisena added that the charges contained in the purported Charge Sheet do not disclose any offence which could have been said to have been committed by him and that the Magistrate has failed to take into account the necessary ingredients of the charges and all the relevant circumstances. He said, that irreparable loss and damage will be caused to his reputation and standing which would be irreversibly affected by responding to the said summons and the final relief would be rendered nugatory unless the interim relief prayed for is granted until the final hearing and determination of this Application. Among other relief, Sirisena sought to issue a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision/order made to issue summons, issue a writ of Prohibition preventing further proceedings being conducted in the relevant case of the Fort Magistrate’s Court upon the said complaint, to grant an interim order until the final hearing and determination of this Application, staying the execution of the said order and to grant an interim order until the final hearing and determination of this application.

The UK-led core group comprises the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Canada, Malawi, North Macedonia and Montenegro. The new countries that would join the fray in co-sponsoring the resolution are Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium , Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Slovakia, Sweden and Türkiye. Last year the resolution was passed on Sri Lanka with 40 countries voting in favour of the resolution 46/1 and it is speculated there would be more countries supporting the resolution this time too.  The GoSL rejected that resolution altogether and criticised the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Riths (OHCHR) recommendation of an evidence-gathering mechanism, a measure that was strongly opposed by Sri Lanka. The Annual Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General has been presented at the Human Rights Council at the 51st session. The draft of the resolution that would be taken for voting recognised the severe economic crisis that has affected Sri Lanka since late 2021, exacerbated by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the profound impact that this has had on the people of Sri Lanka, including women-led households. Also, the draft resolution underscores the importance of addressing the underlying governance factors and root causes that have contributed to that crisis, including deepening militarisation, lack of accountability in governance and impunity for serious human rights violations and abuses, which remains a central obstacle to the rule of law, reconciliation and sustainable peace and development in Sri Lanka. The Government has held a series of meetings with the UN member countries that have voting rights to vote in favour of the Sri Lankan government. Currently, the GoSL and the Tamil Diapora are lobbying to favour  them at when the resolution is taken up for voting while several international rights groups, like the Human Rights Watch have been pushing for a strong resolution on Sri Lanka to address the alleged human rights violations.

This is in the backdrop of the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers’ Union warning that daily power cuts are likely to be extended to 10 hours a day, if coal is not received by 25 October. The Minister tweeted, Lanka Coal Company will publish a new International Open Competitive Tender that will allow any suitable supplier that can provide Coal on a long-term credit basis. “To fulfil the immediate requirements, the balance of 19 Cargos from last year’s tender will be advanced,” Wijesekara said. The Ministry of Power and Energy earlier requested assistance from the Attorney General in providing legal clearance for the coal tender of the Lakvijaya Power Plant, in a backdrop where operations at the Kelanitissa and Lakvijaya power plants were running the risk of coming to a complete standstill by November 2022. The supplier has decided to suspend contract performance due to the filing of a Fundamental Rights Petition by Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera. Ven. Thera filed the petition requesting the Apex Court to issue a verdict that the fundamental human rights of the people have been violated by offering the tender for the purchase of coal for the Lakvijaya Power Plant to the Black Sand Commodities Company located in the State of Dubai. Therefore, Minister Wijesekara asked the Cabinet to allow the Attorney General to assist with the case and if that is not possible, to give Cabinet permission to call a Spot Tender for coal shipments. With coal supply uncertain, operations at the Kelanitissa and Lakvijaya Power Plants risk coming to a halt by November 2022, according to the Ministry of Power and Energy. The said tender sparked controversy when allegations were levelled that irregularities has occurred around the tender process. Also, questions were raised about the prices of the tender claiming that it was too high. A company called Black Sands Commodities FZ LLC based in the UAE was given the deal to supply 4.5 million tonnes of coal from Vanino Port, Russia. This is the largest tender awarded for coal in Sri Lanka to date.  It was supposed to supply coal at a base rate of USD 295.22 and USD 33 a tonne for freight. The deal was supposed to be for seasons 2022-2023, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. However the firm had agreed to give six months credit. Meanwhile, Chairman of Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Janaka Rathnayake recently said that the current coal stocks are only enough until 25 October. Thirty per cent of the country’s electricity supply depends on the Lakvijaya power plant despite one generator being out of order. More than 40 per cent of the electricity demand is met from Lakvijaya when all three generators are in operation. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

Bandula was born in 1943 and brought from Anuradhapura to Dehiwala Zoo in 1946. It was an abandoned elephant calf when it was found in Anuradhapura. According to the National Zoological Gardens’ Director General, Bandula passed away due to age-related ailments. Bandula was the oldest elephant cared for by a Zoo in Sri Lanka, according to Dr. Premakantha. He claimed that Bandula’s condition had been closely watched over by veterinarians and her keepers at the Zoo for many years, and the elderly elephant had been given treatment and supportive care for a variety of age-related complaints. “One of the key attractions at the Dehiwala Zoo is Bandula. Many people cared for him and loved him. The average life expectancy of an elephant in the wild is around 50 years, whereas an elephant kept in captivity can live up to 70 years. However, Bandula had the good fortune to spread love for nine more years. Bandula provided so much happiness to so many families, and everyone who visited him would always remember him,” he said. He said, the Zoo’s employees treated Bandula with compassion and made sure he was as comfortable as possible during his final moments. On 23 September, Bandula’s final rites were performed at the Dehiwala Zoo. BY Thameenah Razeek and Risidra Mendis"

He pointed out that Sri Lanka and India gradually have to wean themselves out of the barriers to investment and the non-tariff barriers to trade, especially in relation to Indo-Lanka economic relations. He made these observations addressing the Sri Lanka India Society (SLIS) get-together held at the Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo recently to mark the 75th Anniversary of Independence of India. “I must thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for the gift of Rs 2 billion that has been given to us to promote Buddhist relations between India and Sri Lanka. We will come across with some new ideas and new projects which will make people aware of the connections between our two countries. Then where is the area where which we can expand. That is in the area of trade and commerce. Actually, many religions have more than one paradise. The Indian and Sri Lankan economies have two paradoxes, one is barriers to investment and the other is non-tariff barriers to trade. Now both our countries have to gradually wean ourselves out of it, especially in Indo-Sri Lanka economic relations. We are working on it because in this age, we do see integration taking place in South-East Asia and East Asia. When they are getting together, what do we do in South Asia?” he asked. Speaking further he opined that India and neighbouring countries Nepal, Sri Lanka Bangladesh should integrate and look forward to trade integration in many areas with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership with the European Union, but the cornerstone of this is to achieve trade integration with India. “I think the future relations of India with its neighbours will be determined by trade integration. Trade integration gives an economic base. Common economic base is a prerequisite for a better national security and better political relations. So, keeping this in mind, we are taking two major steps. First one is to revive and upgrade the FTA into a comprehensive economic and technological partnership. We started that in 2018 and 2019. Then I found recently that it has been stuck somewhere in the Department of Commerce with a large number of committees,” he said. Speaking further he also noted that he has decided to establish an international trade office which will deal with all the international trade negotiations.

However, it is one of the 12 projects by JICA that had been suspended due to the financial crisis in Sri Lanka and calling for the IMF push, Ceylon Today reliably learns. Sri Lanka hopes to use the tallest tower in South Asia as the hub of digital transmission network.  The first and second floor of the top part of the Lotus Tower (Right below the lotus flower) that is designated for digital transmission has been allocated by the Telecom Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL). Japan currently does not want to engage in any projects or funding until Sri Lanka’s financial situation is revived, possibly after taking the IMF bailout of some USD 3.2 billion. Top officials attached to the TRCSL said that in the hope of obtaining the JICA fund, some of the areas of work had already commenced, but at a slow pace. Japan has been sceptical about Sri Lanka over projects being dished out to other countries while sidelining them on two mega projects such as the East Container Terminal, for which they had completed feasibility studies. Similarly, the light rail transport (LRT) project that was marked for Japan was pulled out citing it was an expensive project with overrated interest rates. Sri Lanka currently in on an analogue transmission system and the lotus tower will completely transfer to a digitized network once the operation starts, hopefully in 2023, noted an engineer attached to the TRCSL. According to TRCSL, the Tower will also house 20 telecommunication service providers, relay defence signals and indirectly contribute to the riddance and removal of high-power TV and FM antennas innumerably positioned at various structures in Colombo City. When the transmission is digitized, on one frequency nearly six transmissions can be in operation. Sri Lanka approved adoption of the European standard for DTTB in 2010 with the aim of switching off analogue broadcasting by 2017. It was the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa, on his visit to Japan in April 2013, that announced the acceptance of the Study Team and the implementation of a test ISDB-T broadcast in Colombo on the initiative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan. JICA which conducted the feasibility study thereafter said through discussions between the study team and concerned parties, that it seems likely that it will be possible for the Lotus Tower to be used as the Colombo transmitting station that will be the prominent transmitting station of the DTTB Platform, and as the DTTB Platform network operations centre. The Lotus Tower was handed over to the Telecom Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) by the Finance Ministry in February 2022. Today, the TRCSL has leased the Tower to Lotus Tower Management Company (Pvt) Ltd. But the TRCSL will run the telecommunication on the first and second floor as a high security area with no access for the public. The telecommunication transmission using the Lotus Tower is still untouched and the Government is gearing for a mega soft loan from Japan’s JICA to handle the digital transmission and digitize all TV and Radio Channels including national security transmission.

Addressing the 56th AGM of Ceylon Association of Shipping Agents, de Silva said phase II of the East Container Terminal (ECT) of the Port of Colombo (POC) has commenced and work is in progress. “It will have a 1320 m long quay to accommodate three Ultra Large Container Carriers (ULCC) which has a length of 400 m or more at -18 to -20 m depth berths with a back yard area. The approximate terminal area is 72 ha. This will be the Second Deep Water terminal and it will add another 3 million TEUs to Port of Colombo. Once ECT and WCT are fully operational in 2024-2025, it will increase the capacity of Port of Colombo by another 7 million TEUs. Shipping lines could enter into terminal services agreements to make use of these developments and provide the throughput boost the port requires,” he said. Speaking further, he also noted SLPA began construction of Phase V of the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) to improve the capacity of the Colombo Port. He said Phase V of the JCT includes an investment of USD 32 million and the construction company for the project is China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC). “Upon the completion of construction, a new yard area of 40,000 square metres will also be added to the JCT. Considering the fact that Port of Colombo (POC) was ranked as the 15th connected port, we invite the world shipping lines to consider more transhipment at POC. The cargo that is brought to POC can be easily connected to the Indian ports, Africa, Bangladesh, Maldives and Far East. Such service may also provide a competitive price for them. CASA could be the voice of being the brand ambassador in promoting the Port of Colombo as a transhipment hub and thereby contribute to growth,” he said. In terms of tourism and cruise shipping, SLPA launched the project to develop and promote heritage city Galle’s Port into a fully-fledged tourist port and leisure hub of South Asia with an investment of USD 175-200 million. “The four-year project is headed by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and will be developed as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP). The project includes two offshore breakwaters to maintain the sufficient calmness in the Galle bay and harbour. To facilitate large cruise ships, it has been proposed to construct a state-of-the-art cruise terminal as well. The aim is to convert Galle into a regional commercial port with additional emphasis on tourism. With new private sector investments, leisure-based commercial activities will also be developed. Additionally, the Port of Trincomalee is been developed focusing on the conventional cargo operations,” he added. Speaking further, he also said “Apart from port infrastructure, we identify the need to develop our ancillary services to move forward in the concept of a hub. A successful hub port requires the full range of ancillary port and marine services at competitive prices in order to be attractive to mainline and feeder operators, casual callers, and attracting vessels specifically for services even without cargo operations.”"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/09/10/slpa-tariff-schedule-breaches-rti-act/,SLPA tariff schedule breaches RTI Act,Author not found,0,2022-09-09T20:30:00+00:00," The Right to Information Commission (RTI) has ruled that Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) charging USD for information requests is not in conformity with the RTI Act. The commission said the SLPA application of its 2022 tariff schedule, which levies charges in USD for information requests, is not in conformity with Section 32 (4) of the RTI Act, No. 12 of 2016.   It also ruled that the SLPA’s manner of application of its own tariff schedule is against the RTI Act. The ruling came following an appeal filed by this writer, after he was charged USD four (Rs 812) with VAT amounting to Rs 64.12 by the SLPA for two additional pages of information requested under the RTI act.  The payment had been made in Lanka Rupees equivalent to USD. Till the ruling by the RTI Commission, with regard to information requests under the RTI Act, the SLPA had provided certified copies of documents up to four pages free of charge. Thereafter, it had levied two USD for every additional page with a separate Value Added Tax (VAT). The Gazette Extraordinary No. 2004/66, dated 3 February 2017, introduced a specific fee schedule for providing photocopies and printouts under the RTI Act. Accordingly, for photocopying, two rupees is charged per one side and four rupees for both sides while for printouts, the fees are fixed at four rupees and eight rupees respectively. However, the Gazette also states where there exists, a previous fee schedule prescribed or issued by public authorities by way of circulars or regulations, that fee schedule shall continue to operate notwithstanding the fees prescribed by the Act. Accordingly, the SLPA claimed the fees were being charged as per the booklet titled ‘SLPA Tariff 2022’ published with the approval of the Minister in charge. It also claimed it had followed the procedure stipulated in Section 37 of the SLPA Act by obtaining approvals from the subject Minister and the Ministry of Finance to impose the tariffs, but said it was not in a position to trace all the approvals obtained from the line Ministry during the last 43 years. The commission, looking into whether the tariff schedule applied by the SLPA was either ‘prescribed or issued’ by way of ‘circulars or regulations’, noted that the SLPA admitted it does not possess all the approvals obtained from the line Ministry for revision of charges or introduction of new charges as required by Section 37 of the SLPA Act.  Accordingly, the commission found, in the absence of mandatory ministerial approvals of both the 2021 and 2022 tariff schedules, it indicates non-compliance of the SLPA with the duties imposed on it by that Section. The commission also held that perusal of the various tariff schedules of the SLPA, in respect of levying fees for ‘certified copies of SLPA documents’, indicates irregularities in conforming to Section 37 (1) of the SLPA Act.  It added that by providing four pages free of charge and levying a fee on additional pages the SLPA had followed the Commission’s Fee Schedule in part and its own tariff schedule in part, in a manner that is patently irregular. But despite the ruling, a source from the RTI Commission said, however, the commission does not have the power to order the SLPA to reimburse the excess fee levied. BY Rifthi Ali"

A survey by the GMOA covering all major hospitals in the island last week revealed that close to 500 doctors had left the country during the past eight months. GMOA Secretary, Dr. Haritha Aluthge lamented on Friday (9), that the most serious issue was that some of them left Sri Lanka without the approval of the Health Ministry. He said that during last few months at least 50 doctors had left the country forcing the Health Ministry to issue ‘vacation of post’ notices. Dr. Aluthge said authorities should take immediate steps to bring the situation under control by taking immediate steps to issue the circular related to that which was issued by the Ministry of Public Administration circular granting special leave up to five years for all Government employees to apply for foreign employment without affecting their seniority. “But unfortunately even after two months the Health Ministry has been unable to issue the amended circular for medical practitioners to avail themselves of this opportunity,” he accused.   Dr. Aluthge stressed the importance of issuing this circular to prevent a collapse in the public healthcare system. He urged the Health Ministry to obtain a proper assessment of the islandwide hospital system and its services.  “Action should be taken to present an accurate assessment regarding the maximum number of doctors who could be sent abroad without disrupting services. The GMOA Secretary urged authorities to take steps in organising a programme that would give proper value to the foreign exchange the country receives from doctors going abroad. This would help them to channel forex to the country directly with confidence, Dr. Aluthge added. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) officials said the results of the tests on the marine animal samples were still pending and did not give any other reasons, but said to inquire from the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA). However, neither MEPA nor NARA explained the cause of the delay in obtaining the results. Those biological samples of dead animals were sent to Sweden on 31 January 2022, according to NARA. Speaking to Ceylon Today, an official from NARA said that a total of 387 samples of sea animals, water and sediments and plastic nurdles were sent for testing to various laboratories and another 14 seawater samples remain to be sent for testing at the moment. The 14 samples are ready for dispatch and the dispatching is yet to be finalised, the official added. MEPA, the sole authority that files legal actions and collects evidence and all other related activities related to marine life and the environment is at a crossroad in obtaining and filing legal actions to claim compensation. It is learnt that over 100 marine samples were sent to Uppsala University.     “There is certainly a delay,” said the NARA official, “one being lack of funds to expedite the testing of the samples”. Others are owing to the fact of obtaining permission and dispatching them and the process involved in sending it, the official added. The water sediments and ocean water were sent to the United Kingdom as well as to India (ALS Testing Services India) respectively and all the results have reached Sri Lanka, the official said.   According to NARA, the biological samples are stored in the freezer at the NARA laboratory and when about to dispatch the MEPA comes to obtain them.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated in Parliament while presenting the Interim Budget 2022 that the Government has decided to establish a SOE Restructuring Unit with a Rs 200 million budget.

Suresh Sha worked as Chief Executive and Board Member of the listed firms Ceylon Beverage Holdings PLC and Lion Brewery (Ceylon) PLC, according to his LinkedIn page. During his 30 years as CEO, he converted a tiny, domestically oriented brewery into an aggressive and competitive FMCG firm that is now one of Sri Lanka’s most successful corporations. Not only does the corporation dominate the beer segment, but also the larger alcobev industry. Lion is the most valuable FMCG brand in the country (Brand Finance, LMD rankings) and its balance sheet is rated AAA by Fitch. Lion and Carlsberg, the Company’s multi-award winning, world-class brands, are produced at a state-of-the-art brewery and reach the trade and consumers via a highly efficient and effective route to market system. Approximately eight per cent of the Company’s output is exported to 27 other nations. Lion Brewery is the third highest taxpayer in Sri Lanka. Suresh constructed an empowered, closely knit, performance-focused organization throughout his tenure that has successfully produced growth possibilities, acquired its key rival, and surmounted various hurdles. He also served as Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Sri Lanka’s apex trade chamber, and is a Past Chairman of the Employers’ Federation of Ceylon.

Evidence was emerging that Covid-19 may increase the risk of developing dementia later in life. September is marked globally as World Alzheimer’s Month and 21 September as World Alzheimer’s Day. LAF, a member of the global association, Alzheimer’s disease International (ADI), is focused on post-diagnosis support for those living with Alzheimer’s and other related dementias and to enhance the wellbeing of their family care givers. The LAF has organised a virtual walk from 1 to 21 September to encourage physical and mental exercise, one of the key factors in helping to delay or prevent Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, while educating participants about the disease. Details are available on their website https://alzlanka.org/together-we-can-do-so-much/, the spokesman said. The service provided by LAF, which is run mainly by volunteers with donations from well-wishers, includes: raising awareness, providing education on risk reduction, memory screening and assessment, an activity centre, caregiver support groups, a helpline, identification bracelets, befriending and counselling and much more to help persons living with dementia and their care givers. “Know Dementia, Know Alzheimer’s” – armed with the power of knowledge, all of us together with LAF can do so much to spot the warning signs of dementia, ensure timely diagnosis, and provide post-diagnosis support for people living with dementia,” the spokesman noted adding that contrary to common belief Alzheimer’s was not a normal part of ageing. It was a disease, for which currently there was no cure but steps can be taken to reduce chances of developing dementia and slowing the onset or progression of the disease.  (DJ)"

According to sources, a team from the Road Development Authority (RDA) had visited Wilpattu National Park last week, after seeking permission from the Director General of Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC). Accordingly, permission has been granted to a team of officials from the RDA, DWLC and the Wanathavilluwa Divisional Secretary to undertake a field visit ‘only’ to observe the status quo of the prevailing road. However, the politician in question with his team had also arrived to take part in the field visit. Officials of the DWLC and the Divisional Secretariat have expressed their displeasure as permission was only granted for government officials to visit the park and the politician had arrived without prior notice. Upon being subjected to opposition by officials he had left with only RDA officials undertaking the field visit.  The Environment Foundation Limited (EFL) and the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) petitioned the Supreme Court in 2010 seeking assurance that no construction within the Wilpattu National Park would be conducted till the final determination of their application. In 2013, the Supreme Court issued a Stay Order to maintain status quo with no further development activity of the road including tarring of road be carried out other than normal repairs of the road. Environmentalists pointed out that any development to the existing road will stand in callous disregard for the SC rule and would amount to contempt of Court. Meanwhile, due to the pressure exerted by the said politician, another meeting had been called by Puttalam District Secretary at the District Secretariat on Thursday (21), where officials of the RDA, Irrigation Department and DWLC were present.  Wildlife officers have pointed out that doing anything against a Supreme Court order will be problematic and above all such road development activity within a National Park will disturb the wildlife and cause a major threat especially to the elephant and leopard population.  By Gagani Weerakoon"

However, according to the conditions under which he was granted the pardon, he would not be able to contest an election for a period of seven years from the date of his release. Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said Ramanayake has not been granted ‘complete’ freedom yet as he was imprisoned on charges of Contempt of Court. “However, he might be able to contest an election when there is a necessity.

Speaking to the media after leaving the Welikada Prison, Ramanayake said he will continue to fight against corruption as promised to the Justice Minister.

Refuting claims that he would change his stance, the former MP said that he will engage in politics as he wants to contest an election and serve the people again. “I will also continue my actions against those who robbed innocent citizens of this country,” he added.  Addressing a media briefing later, Ramanayake revealed that he is prohibited from speaking on certain matters according to the conditions of the Presidential Pardon given to him.  “I’d love to speak like I used to, but I cannot,” he said.

The report filed by the committee has stressed that due to loss of forest cover for animals to roam in the upcountry areas and the scarcity of meat, leopards have started entering into human settlements. As a result, leopards get ensnared in traps set for animals roaming in estates. The committee also added that in order to bring the situation under control, it would be pertinent to educate the residents in estates on the importance of protecting endangered animals and how to handle animals in distress.

Accordingly, it has been planned to appoint Opposition MPs as chairpersons of the Sectoral Oversight Committees and grant them perks similar to Cabinet Ministers. It is reported that a group of SJB MPs and Samagi Jana Sandhanaya members will be appointed to the posts of the Sectoral Oversight Committees. Ceylon Today also learns that Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has given his approval for the MPs to go for discussions if they receive invitations regarding the committees. Seventeen Sectoral Oversight Committees in Parliament were established under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. They were abolished after the 20th Amendment was passed.

Kariyawasam said they were still wondering what had actually taken place in regard to whether the former President had sought the intervention of the Armed Forces and the Police, or whether his request had been ignored on the part of the military and the Police. The SLPP General Secretary said these pertinent and valid questions had cropped up among members of his party, amidst the overnight violent and controversial crackdown of the anti-Government protests, by the former President’s successor Ranil Wickremesinghe. “It has to be probed thoroughly, as to orders given by him to the Tri-Forces and the Police had been overlooked or whether he had not sought their intervention to quell the protests. As a person with a high-profile military background, it is a question that could one day, be answered solely by the former President. This issue gathers pace due to the fact that the new President, who has no link to the Security Forces, was able to crush the anti-government protests within a 24-hour period of having assumed the new portfolio. Thus, he was able to free State institutions such as the President’s House in Fort, Temple Trees, the PM’s Office, and the Presidential Secretariat, which were stormed by protesters, within a matter of days.” He also added a future rewriting of Sri Lanka’s political history would reveal without reasonable doubt whether a conspiracy hatched by certain elements with vested interests within his party, was behind the country’s long-drawn-out economic and political upheaval. It forced a sitting President out of office and compelled him to flee the country, becoming a persona non grata in the process. Kariyawasam, however, could not reveal the names of those behind the conspiracy. But, the MP maintained those capable of reading between the lines or those in the political grapevine, were aware of who they are. (JK)"

Speaking to the media on Friday (19), at JVP Headquarters, Silva said, the President should resolve the economic, political, and social crises expeditiously. “Instead, he is appeasing the Rajapaksa clan, by repressing the public,” he said. Sri Lanka has turned away from democracy and is presently moving towards a repressive regime that denies the citizens of their fundamental rights, Silva said, adding that without solving the country’s pressing issues, the President is repressing the innocent people who voice their concerns. “The President acts as if he is a ‘liberal’ when he is actually an oppressor,” he alleged. He also mentioned about the arrests that were made by the Police on 18 August following a protest rally that was held by university students at Union Place, Colombo. “The students held a peaceful protest, but they were dispersed with Police brutally. Tear gas, water cannons, and baton attacks were used to disperse them. Protesting is a right of the citizens, however, Wickremesinghe is waiting for them to take to the streets, so that he can attack them using the Security Forces,” Silva alleged. He added that as the JVP, they condemn these brutal attacks on innocent people. Further, Silva commented on Government attacks on journalists. “We can see that journalists who are covering the protests are being assaulted. They are simply doing their job. It is their responsibility to show the people what is happening in the country. However, there were occasions where journalists were attacked and their equipment was destroyed,” he alleged. The JVP strongly condemns these acts of the Government, he said. Moreover, Silva alleged the Government is angry with citizens for ousting leaders. Further, he said Parliament should be dissolved as soon as possible, and a new Government should be elected with the mandate of the people.

The Special Committee which had been appointed by the GMOA to look into existing drug shortages in state health institutions will submit their report in the coming week. GMOA Media Committee Member, Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe on Friday (19), responding to queries, said as had been revealed in the Auditor General’s report on procedures taken to avoid the shortage of pharmaceuticals in Government Hospitals, there were 1,146 pharmaceutical items used in hospitals as vital, essential, and non-essential. The number of surgical items were 8,648, the number of laboratory items were 3,900, and the X-ray items were 44.  “Of these, the number of out of stock vital and essential surgical items in the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and hospitals were 190 and 51 respectively,” he said, quoting the Report. The number of out of stock laboratory items and X-ray items in the MSD and hospitals were 850 and 18 respectively. Dr. Wijesinghe said although the forex issue in the country was a hindering factor in pharmaceutical imports, there were more serious issues like the lack of coordination amongst the stakeholders involved in procurement procedures, the delays in maintenance and updating of online systems, and the lack of sensitivity within the Health Ministry towards the prevailing issue of drug shortages. There were drug shortages reported from Anuradhapura, Badulla, and several other areas. But the problem prevails from the National Hospitals down to even the central dispensaries of the country.  He said the Committee had been tasked with going to the grassroots level to gather data in a bid to find short-term, mid-term, and long-term solutions to the issue. “We hope to present the report at the General Committee Meeting to be held on 24 August 2022, before which the report would be submitted. It would also be made public. The GMOA would request a meeting with Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella during which it hopes to discuss the report and find solutions.” Fielding questions, he said measures should be taken to increase efficiency in the quality assurance system to invite more investors to manufacture pharmaceuticals locally. At present, there were hiccups in the system adapted to encourage investors to locally manufacture medicinal drugs, the Media Committee Member said.    By Dilanthi Jayamanne "

Jaishankar reaffirmed that India would give all the help it could to Sri Lanka at the IMF. India is one of the foremost countries that have pushed for the IMF bailout package for Sri Lanka amidst the financial meltdown and political crisis. Dr. Jaikshankar ended his two-day tour to Bangkok  on 18 August at the outset of Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe gearing to tour to Japan next month to request Japan to invite the main creditor nations of Sri Lanka, — China and India, for talks on bilateral debt restructuring when he meets Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida too. “Someone needs to call in and invite the major creditor countries. We will request that Japan do so,” the President had told Reuters recently. The main creditors of Sri Lanka are Japan, China, India and USA among many others whom the IMF has urged to do a debt repayment structure that has still not taken shape. India has done its best to assist Sri Lanka, Dr. Jaishankar told the audience at the Chulalongkorn University Bangkok, where he delivered a speech on the subject ‘India’s Vision of the Indo-Pacific’. He recalled that India has extended USD 3.8 billion of support to Sri Lanka, including lines of credit and swap arrangements. “Sri Lanka, a nation of 22 million, is in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis that has led to severe shortages of fuel and other essentials. The Sri Lankan Government is negotiating with the IMF for a bailout package,” he said. India latest gift was a Dornier Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft on 15 August towards strengthening the maritime security of Sri Lanka at a special event held in Sri Lanka Air Force Base, Katunayake. The Induction of the aircraft is timely in view of the current challenges to Sri Lanka’s maritime security, India said. Dr. Jaishankar claimed that the Quad will be beneficial to the entire Indo-Pacific region and that any objections to its actions may be a result of “unilateralist opposition to collective and cooperative endeavors.” The Quad nations include Japan and India besides the United States and Australia. “We envision an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous, based on a rules-based international order, sustainable and transparent infrastructure investment, freedom of navigation and over flight, unhindered legal trade, mutual respect for sovereignty, peaceful resolution of disputes, and equality of all nations,” he said."

Ilangasinghe on Friday (19), ordered 16 suspects who were arrested and produced in Court, after being charged with conducting an anti-Government protest organised by the IUSF on 18 August, to be enlarged on a surety bail of Rs 500,000 each. Out of 19 suspects arrested in connection with the said incident, 16 of them were produced in Court by Slave Island Police and they were subsequently granted bail. IUSF Convener Wasantha Mudalige and two others were further remanded. Following this, Additional Magistrate Ilangasinghe ordered the passport of suspect Jehan Appuhamy to be impounded, based on a request by the Police. It was revealed in Court that during the course of the protest, Appuhamy had been arrested by the Police, but managed to flee from custody. Slave Island Police informed the Court that Intelligence Units had reported to them that during the protest staged by the IUSF on 18 August the protesters had planned to forcibly enter the premises of the Presidential Secretariat and the Finance Ministry. They told the Additional Magistrate that during the course of the protest, those engaged in it had hurled and pelted stones in the direction of the Police Officers at Lipton Circus. The Police pointed out that an ASP had ordered the protesters to end the demonstration peacefully, but the protesters had not heeded his instructions. They stated that as the protesters had begun to behave violently towards its officers, they were compelled to arrest the suspects. The Police explained further investigations were continuing into the incident and urged the Court to issue an order for the suspects to be further remanded, as the probe was still underway. President’s Counsels Saliya Pieris and Rienzie Arsekularatne looked into the interests of the suspects. Pieris PC told the Additional Magistrate that his clients had been engaged in a peaceful protest near the Lipton Circus and at that time the Police Officers had proceeded from Slave Island to Union Place, after which they had begun to mercilessly assault the protesters for no apparent reason. He added that though the prosecution had claimed that his clients had strived to forcibly enter the Presidential Secretariat premises, the Police had only arrested the protesters in Borella, Ward Place, and Narahenpita. The BASL President therefore charged that the Police had intentionally submitted spurious details to Court, with the aim of obtaining an order for the unjust incarceration of the protesters. He also opined that as per the Constitution, protesters or any citizen has been guaranteed the right to conduct peaceful protests and express dissent. Pieris PC observed it was clear at this juncture, that it was not his clients who have behaved violently and aggressively and that it was the Police which had done so. He then prayed the Court to issue an order for the release of his clients on any suitable bail conditions. The lawyer representing Appuhamy told the Court that his client had at no time fled from Police custody. He informed the Additional Magistrate that his client had gone to the Maradana Police to surrender, at which point he had been informed that there was no necessity for it. He stated afterwards the suspect had left the Maradana Police Station and insisted that his client was willing to appear in Court whenever noticed. Considering the submissions, the Court ordered to ban foreign travel of suspect Appuhamy. The Magistrate then ordered the suspects who were produced in Court to be released on bail. Further proceedings of the trial were then fixed for 12 September. By Hansi Nanayakkara"

The Minister said the JJB has been seeking a snap general election for quite some time while insisting the present Parliament does not reflect the true motives of the public. But, the Minister said the JVP and its present alliance known as the JJB have failed to justify their demands for a poll whenever they have sought a fresh mandate from voters and has being shunned big time by the public. Rajapakshe added under the present circumstances, the President was hamstrung in his bid to dissolve the House and call for a snap Poll, as it was highly impractical to do so. But, he observed when the country stabilises both on the economic and political spheres, it will not be impossible to lay the groundwork for a General Election. He however, still challenged the JVP-led JJB to justify their demand for a Parliamentary Poll, by winning a sizeable number of seats in the new Legislature. The Minister added that due to the open or behind the scenes role played by the JJB during the spate of anti-Government protests in Colombo since last April, it will be a shock if the NPP could turn such anti-Government sentiments into a stupendous victory at the next General Election.

Sri Lanka is a sovereign country and makes its own independent decisions, said Official Spokesperson, Ministry of External Affairs, India, Arindam Bagchi yesterday (12). Sri Lanka has only postponed the arrival of the ship at Hambantota so far. Regarding India’s security concerns, he said, it’s the sovereign right of each country and India would make the best judgment in their own interest and it naturally takes into account the prevailing situation in the region, especially in their water areas. In the context of China-India relations we have consistently maintained that we treat others with mutual respect sensitivity and future interest, he added. On 9 August, China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin referred to the halting of the vessel entering Hambantota Port, it is “completely unjustified” for certain countries to cite so-called “security concerns” to put pressure on Sri Lanka. He was hinting at India without mentioning the name. Diplomatic clearance for the Chinese vessel to make a call at the Hambantota Port from 11-17 August, for replenishment purposes, was conveyed by the Ministry to the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Colombo on 12 July, which the Government approved. Subsequently, in light of the need for further consultations, the Ministry has communicated to the Embassy of China in Colombo to defer the visit of the said vessel to the Hambantota Port, the Foreign Ministry said. The Chinese spokesperson urged the relevant parties to see China’s marine scientific research activities in a rational light and stop disrupting normal exchanges and cooperation between China and Sri Lanka. Bagchi said, as far as India-Sri Lanka relations are concerned, India has extended, under Neighbourhood First policy, an unprecedented support of USD 3.8 billion over the serious economic situation and supports Sri Lanka’s democracy stability and economic recovery. The vessel had slowed down its voyage since Thursday (11) according to the latest satellite imagery, after Sri Lanka withdrew its berthing permission The Indian media, referring to sources in the Indian defence and security establishment said the destination of the vessel continues to be the Lankan port. According to reports, the ship was last seen near India’s maritime border, on the country’s eastern side, not far from Visakhapatnam, but near Chennai. However, the course has now changed, and it is still unknown where the ship will go. It is presently travelling along the Hambantota side of the southern eastern waters. China constructed Hambantota Port and assumed ownership through a 100-year lease after Sri Lanka was unable to make payments, but this does not entitle it to dock its ships, as observed by Harbour Master, Captain Nirmal de Silva. Even after the Chinese ship received official consent through the Foreign Ministry’s diplomatic channels, Captain de Silva stated that as the Harbour Master he must still authorise the ship’s docking in any Sri Lankan port. The Harbour Master further said any ship, whether commercial or warship, has to obtain permission to enter any port. According to reports, Chinese officials had held another round of talks to obtain clearance, but they were not granted but deferred. The postponement means they can ask for permission again, which will have to be fresh approval from the Government’s diplomatic channel as well as from the Harbour Master, Captain de Silva said.

They said FTZMA, which is the sole trade chamber, representing BOI investor companies in all the Free Trade Zones on the island, the published electricity hike by the PUCSL is a rising concern of the export manufacturing sector which consume more electricity. It’s quite alarming, and some of the enterprises might be facing the danger of closure due to the electricity hike. “You can observe that industry sectors in all categories are currently experiencing the largest hikes as this incremental cost is going to add to their manufacturing cost which would result in making ‘Made in Sri Lanka’ products in the export market highly uncompetitive. Moreover, the Small Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs) in the category 1-1 being hit hardest by this price hike are extremely worried about the impact on their liquidity position and business survival.” They pointed out that the foreign direct investment is evaluated by using many criteria of which the cost of operation is becoming a significant determinant because energy cost, electricity is directly associated with the cost of production of the investors. Therefore, they urged the Minister to re-visit and analyse the price structure once again mind bearing that FDIs (Foreign Direct Investors) are the future lifeline. They demanded a reasonable revision in the price change. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Addressing the media on 12 August, MP J.C. Alawathuwala noted that the many people have forgotten the beginning of the Aragalaya. “We saw yesterday that the youth who were at Galle Face had left. I would like to say one thing to the politicians and the entire people of this country. None of us should underestimate the Aragalaya, but later it was taken over by the political parties.” “There were many struggles in this country after independence. Many lives were lost in the struggle of 1971 but at the same time many precious lives were lost in our country in the rebellion of ‘88/89. Also we saw that in the 30 years of the war, many lives were lost due to the explosion of bombs all over the country but none of these rebel groups were able to defeat the rulers of our country,” he added. He further noted that the recent ‘Aragalaya’ that started in April is a very strong peaceful struggle, we saw how the people of the country came out on the streets lighting lamps at the Kohuwala Junction. “We saw that the struggle was able to drive out the rulers who were responsible for the current plight of the country, regardless of race, religion, caste and parties. The Cabinet was changed a few times. The former Prime Minister had to resign through that struggle. Basil Rajapaksa, who contributed a lot to create this chaotic situation in the country, had to resign. Finally, the Aragalaya succeeded in expelling the president who was elected by 6.9 million of votes,” he added. Alawathuwala noted that the Aragalaya has made history in Sri Lanka and the politicians should never forget its impact. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

According to a Spokesman for the Ministry of Power and Energy, the highest loss occurred after 2015. In a tweet, the Minister said selling products at subsidised prices for years is also one of the reasons for losses. The spokesman said this is due to the delay in establishing a fuel price formula and not increasing prices at the appropriate moment. Wijesekara said purchases made before March 2022 were for 90-180 days credit purchased at Rs 203 for a USD and the payback rate is Rs 367-390 for per USD, pointing out that rupee devaluation also led to CPC making losses. He further noted that SriLankan Airlines owed USD 300 million to CPC and Rs. 60 billion from the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

He pointed out that the CPC was not running refineries and relying more on imported refined products, as well as expensive distribution spending. According to the CPC spokesman, in order to restructure the institution, a committee was formed under the chairmanship of Minister Wijesekara, with the Ministry Secretary and a member from the Treasury as members.

FUTA stressed that it is truly ironic that the repression has been unleashed by a government led by Ranil Wickremesinghe, who said his entire political career is based on ‘liberal principles.’ In a letter, the FUTA Secretary Rohan Laksiri stated that they stand by the brave youth and activists drawn from every nook and corner of Sri Lankan society, who for more than one hundred days led a highly successful and internationally admired struggle ‘Aragalaya’ to demand accountable and democratic governance. “The ‘Aragalaya’ was one of the most significant events in Sri Lanka’s social and political history and it achieved many democratic gains. It bravely challenged the corrupt political system in the country and succeeded in sending a deeply unpopular cabinet of ministers, dominated by the dynastic Rajapaksa family home. They sent then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and finally former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa home”, he added. He said that however, with the appointment of Ranil Wickremesinghe as President, many of these gains are being rapidly reversed. “From the time he assumed office, Wickremesinghe has engaged in a political witch hunt, targeting ‘Aragalaya’ leaders and at the same time attempting to characterise it as a form of anarchy. Nevertheless, this spurious discourse by the “Ranil-Rajapaksa’ government has been roundly criticised by international observers, liberal governments across the world, progressive media, and a range of domestic and international rights activists and organizations,” he said. Further, FUTA has decided to play an active role to both protect the youth and ‘Aragalaya’ leadership and at the same time to safeguard and nurture the democratic spirit of the ‘Aragalaya,. (AK)"

Addressing the media on Friday (5), MP Mujibur Rahman said a solid programme must be introduced with regard to forming an All-Party Government that is agreed by everyone. “Such a programme is crucial for the formation of the All-Party Government. A programme that is acceptable by all must be brought forward with a definitive timeline and clear objectives,” he added. Rahman said, a common goal must be initiated with the involvement of all political parties for the wellbeing of the country. Meanwhile, MP Niroshan Perera, who addressed the same media briefing, noted the reason the SJB supports an All-Party Programme is that they know that the country is in a very difficult situation economically. “If we do not make unpopular economic policy changes, the people will have to suffer even more in the future. We do not only look at the matter from a political angle. We have to be responsible as an Opposition that is not limited to criticism,” he added. Perera said that in order to implement All-Party Government, the government should ensure the fundamental rights of the people. Meanwhile, a discussion was held on Friday (5) between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the SJB on the establishment of an All-Party Government.  Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, Chief Opposition whip Lakshman Kiriella, SJB General Secretary MP Ranjith Maddumabandara and several MPs participated in the discussion.

FHOA President, Devika Kodithuwakku told Celyon Today on Friday (5) that family health officers are forced to waste time in fuel queues to get four litres of petrol despite the QR code system being implemented. “We are not asking for priority, but basic convenience of being able to obtain the quota of fuel  to carry out our duties in the field should be afforded to,” she appealed.  Kodithuwakku noted that four litres of fuel is only adequate for an office employee with a motorbike to travel to and from work. But family health officers carry out their duties by going house to house, she said “Family health officers serving in outstation areas have to travel long distances at times depending on the persons receiving their services. The situation at the moment is such that field employees of the State health service have started to wonder as to whether the Health Ministry and the Government are trying to put a stop to even the field work carried out by family health officers”. Although the price of fuel was increased and public transport fares hiked, measures were not taken to increase the travel  allowance, Kodithuwakku observed.  “Therefore the Health Ministry and government authorities should at least ensure that the health services don’t have to languish in fuel queues so they can carry out their services”.

Gross indecency laws have also been used to arrest heterosexual couples for holding hands and kissing in parks. Wickramesinghe noted that the Regulations empower the Police and Military to break into people’s homes and arrest them on suspicion of committing the offence.  He added that a Fundamental Rights Petition has already been filed in this regard and several others will be filed.

Jeewantha Peiris and other protesters.  The Bishop, priests and religious of the Catholic Diocese of Ratnapura, in the Sabaragamuwa Province, demanded the government to protect the fundamental rights of the peaceful struggle as was accepted by the President in Parliament on 3 August 2022. In a letter, signed by the Bishop of Ratnapura, Rt. Rev. Dr. Cletus Perera, Vicar General Rev. Fr. Damian Fernando, Chancellor Fr. Milton Wickramasinghe, Judicial Vicar Fr. Niroshan Vaz and Procurator General, Pastor Fr. AyalIndika Fernando, they urged the government to provide immediate relief to the economic problems while adopting “sustainable, people-friendly pro-poor economic policies  for long term recovery,” of the country. They called for the government to establish a multiparty, interim government and hold elections in order to form a government with a people’s mandate.  They said that Fr. Jeevantha Peiris had been serving in a very isolated  Parish in  the Ratnapura Diocese where most parishioners and people were workers in rubber estates. “True to his calling Fr. Jeevantha has sought to bring good news to the poor, whose right to education, health, housing, reasonable wages and identity  have continuously been violated.”  The Bishop and Priests expressed extreme concern about the visits   by various Police officers to churches in the Ratnapura Diocese and to Fr. Jeevantha’s parents’ home, they said alleging that the Police officers had even implied that the Priest was involved in crime. “On one occasion, they had informed Priests that there were orders from Colombo to arrest him,” they said.   Rev. Dr. Perera and the Priests said that Fr. Jeevantha had reached beyond his parish to understand and support the struggle for the rights and justice of people in different parts of the country including the war affected North. He actively participated in the people’s struggles as he understood the structural and systematic nature of the problems affecting the poor in his parish and in other parts of the country.  They said that they had been in touch with Fr. Jeevantha, met him and supported him in his mission which they noted they considered to be a part of priestly mission in the service of God.     They observed that Fr. Jeevantha had privately and publicly insisted on a peaceful struggle even in the face of violent repression. He sought consensus amongst diverse persons and groups coming with different experiences and ideologies. They noted that, Fr. Jeevantha’s involvement had also been an encouragement to protesters- especially to other religious leaders and youth.      The Catholic Clergy said they were concerned by the media reports on the overseas travel ban imposed on Fr. Jeevantha and several others involved in the protests. “We are conscious that emergency regulations and other laws have been used in the past to repress dissent and against ethnic minorities,” they noted.  People continue to die in fuel queues, incidents of murder are reported regularly and bodies continue to be washed up on beaches, said the concerned Dioceans accusing the government of continuing with intent of repressing protests and proteters. “We worry that this authoritarian and insensitive approach in dealing with the massive economic and political crisis may lead to further discontent and hamper international assistance in which respect for rule of law and human rights are often decisive conditions,” they observed.  (DJ)"

In addition, other ongoing projects continue to support basic services, the delivery of medicine and medical supplies, school meals and tuition waivers.” “We are working closely with implementing agencies to establish robust controls and fiduciary oversight to ensure these resources reach the poorest and most vulnerable. We will continue to monitor this closely. We are also coordinating closely with other development partners to maximise the impact of our support for the people of Sri Lanka.

The initiative conducted in collaboration with the Colombo Municipal Council and Public Health midwives will provide much-needed relief to the urban poor and most disadvantaged families facing severe hardship and struggling to put food on their table. “As food inflation and the price of basic commodities continues to increase, more and more families are struggling,” said UNICEF Sri Lanka Representative Emma Brigham. “The lack of affordable nutritious food has a life-long impact on children, especially those in their early years of life. The programme being launched is an important step to bring some relief to food insecure families, but much more is urgently needed,” she added. With food inflation rising over 80 per cent in June and continuing to increase, critical support in the form of regular monthly cash transfers of Rs. 5,000 is being provided to about 3,000 mothers with new-born babies in Colombo Municipal area as a way of bringing some relief to those who are food insecure, over the next three months. The mothers will also receive critical information on breastfeeding and nutrition for children. UNICEF is also providing nutritious meals to over 40 public pre-schools and day-care centres, serving children from low-income families including those with special needs, for a period of six months. This incentive is focused on preventing acute malnutrition and promoting early learning as the crucial first step in a child’s development, in a country that has the second highest levels of wasting among children under five in the South Asia region.

He stated that of this number around 75,000 such families are presently struggling to survive, not being sure what to consume with regard to their daily food intake. Furthermore, he added that of the 75,000 families, around 40,000 families are receiving food or nutrition via saline. He warned if Sri Lanka’s food security is not established, people will have to face a major nutritional deficiency next year.  Dr. Batagoda, noting that a sum of USD 900 million is required to uplift the agricultural sector, proposed focusing on starting a USD account for the future development of the agriculture sector due to the difficulties faced in obtaining such amounts from the government treasury at once.  He emphasised that Sri Lankans working in foreign countries, International organisations and other aid groups can fund the account. Accordingly, the Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera instructed the Secretary of the Ministry to prepare a Cabinet Memorandum to maintain a USD account under the Ministry of Agriculture. This was following a discussion at the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation under the patronage of Amaraweera in the presence of Dr. Batagoda, secretaries of the ministry Rohana Pushpakumara and Chandra Herath and the Moneragala and Hambantota District Secretaries and a group of officials on 29 Friday.  Amaraweera mentioned that President Ranil Wickremesinghe pledged that steps will be taken to ensure food safety while agreeing to prioritise food production in the coming period.

Addressing the media on Friday (29), Premadasa noted that foreign diplomats such as Samantha Power clearly say the stability of the country must be secured and there must be a macroeconomic framework.  It is questionable what the members of the current Government have done in the last few months without setting this framework, he stressed. He further said the country can be built in this situation only with a new mandate. “Don’t play political games. Give a chance for a stable mandate to build the country. At a time where survival in this country has become difficult for the public, the current Government is engaged in political gambling. In this gambling, there is no solution to the problems of all people such as fuel, gas, milk powder and fertiliser,” he added. Premadasa said, the country needs a new Government and it should disappear in a new mandate without a private agreement and it should be done through a poll. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

She said, through ‘Aragalaya’, the people of the country are demanding a change from the rotten politics. Addressing the media on Friday (22), at the JVP headquarters, she said although he appears as a great liberal who respects democracy, his true nature has been understood during this time. “We have to decide carefully on the next chapter of the struggle. Currently, there is a parliament and a president without a mandate. Not only does he have no mandate, but all the reactionary people have appointed Parliament to represent his actions. This Parliament is not a place to represent the people. It is not a place to express people’s opinion,” she stressed. Accordingly, Parliament should be dissolved to appoint new representatives who truly portray the people’s mandate. It is not just about changing the new President and his Cabinet that was sworn in, Parliament should be made a place that actually represents the people. The final victories of the struggle can only be achieved through that, she emphasised. Also addressing the media, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva alleged that the people are not protected by Ranil Wickremesinghe who got the Prime Ministership without a mandate and got the Presidency with the blessing of the Rajapaksas. He said, Wickremesinghe serves the dethroned Rajapaksas who had to give up their positions due to the ‘Aragalaya’. “JJB is making a massive intervention to continue this fight until a government that represents the sovereignty of the people of this country is established. Not only Wickremesinghe but also this Parliament is against the peoples’ opinion. It is necessary to create a parliament that represents the real popular opinion instead of the parliament that distorted the mandate of Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and President without the consent of the people,” he said.

Tea export earnings were Sri Lanka’s third largest foreign exchange (FX) earner for two consecutive years to last year (2021), Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data. Consequently tea export earnings fell for the sixth consecutive month to last month (June), with tea export earnings last month alone declining by 6.69 per cent (US$ 8.35 million) YoY to US $ 117.42 million (fob), Forbes statistics showed. Complementing this, tea export volumes fell by 12.63 per cent (3.41 million kg) YoY to 23.58 million kg last month. However, the silver lining was that tea prices increased by 6.87 per cent (US $ 0.32) to US$ 4.98 a kg (fob), YoY, last month, recording its second consecutive monthly gain to last month. Nonetheless, tea export earnings in the first six months (first half) of the year declined by 11.58 per cent (US $76.15 million) to US $ 581.35 million (fob) YoY and export volumes were down by 8.53 per cent (11.69 million kg) to 125.29 million kg.  In a further blow, average tea prices in the first six months of the year fell by 3.45 per cent (US $ 0.16) to US $ 4.64 per kg, YoY. According to Forbes, Iraq emerged as the No. 1 major importer of Sri Lanka Tea in the first half of the year with an increase of 46 per cent year on year (YoY) in January-June 2022 to 23.51 million kg. UAE secured second position with a total of 10.74 million kilos which is a four per cent increase against total imports recorded for January-June 2021. Russia sits in 3rd place with a total of 10.10 M/Kg followed by Türkiye, Azerbaijan, Iran and China respectively during the period January-June 2022. A significant decrease in imports is reported from Russia (24 per cent), Türkiye (58 per cent), China (23 per cent), Syria (24 per cent) and Jordon (23 per cent) YoY, Forbes further said. ‘Fob’ or ‘free on board’ means the price of the goods when boarded in a vessel for export at the exporter’s port. ‘Cif’ or ‘cost, insurance, freight’ means the price of goods, after being received at the importer’s port.

This violence is an attack on all the people of Sri Lanka who have been demanding democratic system change, FUTA alleged in a statement. General Secretary of FUTA Rohan Laksiri stated, “Under cover of darkness, even when protesters had informed authorities that they would leave the locations on Friday (22), the armed forces chose to brutally attack the protest site. Journalists were attacked, a lawyer has been arrested and many peaceful protesters have been injured and arrested. This is a dark day for democracy that will stand out in the history of this country.” New President, Ranil Wickremesinghe has now clearly demonstrated the type of rule that we can expect from him. He cannot and will not be permitted to continue this outrage on the rights of citizens, or to irrevocably destroy basic democratic norms through the arbitrary use of military force, he said. “Wickremesinghe’s deployment of the military in this manner fails even to acknowledge the pain and suffering that led to the protests throughout the country including GotaGoGama. Instead of listening to the voices and sentiments of the people, this violence is designed to simply silence and threaten them by brute force,” he claimed. “FUTA stands with the protesters who have been attacked on 22 July and on the side of democracy. We renew our pledge to work with all trade unions and people’s movements to mobilise support that will take forward further struggles to protect the democratic rights and freedoms of all the people in this country,” Rohan Laksiri  added.

Speaking to the media Kumudesh said the President had missed his last chance to make that political transformation for the country. The President’s conduct as soon as he assumed duties cannot be approved by anyone with political experience. “Even if he had deployed the world’s most skilled Army to suppress unarmed protesters without even a palm stave in their hands, it would make one wonder if someone like President Wickremesinghe, who had been in politics for more than five decades, had taken such a decision,” he added. He stressed on the need to win the people’s struggle for political transformation. Even before the lapse of 24 hours, Wickremesinghe proved that he was not the leader needed for that struggle. Instead the new President, who was elected as a result of that struggle, had proved that he was a mere tool in the hands of the Rajapaksas. By using the Armed Force to squash unarmed protesters he had proved himself to be a traitor to the struggle and the political transformation that the people were asking for.  Kumudesh said the President should be held directly responsible for the disastrous conditions that may arise in the country in the future following this incident.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne "

Lawyers who tried to enter the area have been prevented from doing so by forces personnel. The BASL has been informed that at least two Lawyers who sought to intervene in their professional capacity had been assaulted by service personnel.

Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) said the inappropriate declaration of emergency is contrary to the rule of law and attempting to control/suppress the fundamental rights of the people by the continuous declaration of emergency violates the Constitution.

He reiterated that though the SJB-led Opposition is determined to form an All-Party Government, the SLPP is not favourable to that notion. “We tried to confirm whether the Opposition parties are still in the same stance prior to the Party Leaders’ meeting, we were informed that some of them have changed their stance. In short, the Opposition could not reach to a common ground. We were thinking to inform the Speaker to appoint a person to the posts with a common agreement. But now, that thought had been shelved. The SJB is still in opinion that the solution lies with an All-party Interim Government. We do not want to continue the current government with few new faces,” Kiriella said. By Nirmani Guneratne"

General Secretary of FUTA Rohan Laksiri, in a letter addressed to the Acting President on 15 July stated that he should pledge to the people that he will not offer himself as a candidate when the Parliament meets to appoint a new President on the 20 July. FUTA demanded the Acting President to desist from using the powers of the office of the Executive President arbitrarily to direct violence and suppress the public at any juncture. He also demanded that he desist from acting in such a manner that gives legitimacy to an illegitimate government. He emphasised, “The ill-thought-out and arbitrary policies of the Rajapaksa regime, corruption and violence are the main causes of this failure. On 9 May of this year, when then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned under tremendous public pressure, you stepped into replace him and gave a new lease of life to a discredited regime. You lost your candidacy for a seat in Parliament at the last general elections and became an MP using the provisions of the national list. The people of this country including those loyal to your own party have roundly rejected you”. Claiming that the public gave Ranil Wickremesinghe an opportunity to prove himself, he said however, it was a failure. “At this point in time, we need a legitimate government and collective and participatory governance. The country is not in need of single-person saviours. The events of 9 July have clearly demonstrated that the present Government has lost all legitimacy,” he stressed. He demanded the Acting President to listen to the voices of reason and the peoples’ will and step down from his office honourably as he is well aware failure to do so could lead to a state of tremendous uncertainty and instability in the country.

Envoy’s views were based on the debt restructuring programme where China was also requested to do the same. “All countries including China should really step in and provide help and assistance to Sri Lanka”. She further added, “It should not just be Western countries or just Japan.  So again, this is a time when all countries should consider what they can give assistance-wise, but also the creditor countries at the IMF all need to be supportive of the tough negotiations that must be done in the coming months. And that will be closely monitored and watched as the debt negotiators and the legal advisers have these discussions with each of their creditors including not just countries but private bondholders”.  The US Ambassador further noted the option for Sri Lanka is to get the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “I do think IMF is the only option for Sri Lanka to get out of its current economic crisis, but that’s not the United States or just me believing that. I think Sri Lankans believe that. I think the international community, economists around the world,” she told local journalists at her official residence on 7 July. Everybody has been talking about this for the past several years, she said adding that Sri Lanka needs to get its economic house in order and go to the IMF.  “And we’ve heard from Sri Lankan former ministers and current ministers saying that Sri Lanka should have gone earlier, sooner, to address this issue. This is not just a concern or a recommendation from the United States alone, or Japan and India.  European countries, many countries have really called upon the steps needed.  And remember that you know, the IMF debt restructuring programme, many of the things that they are recommending in order to get assistance, these are things that it’s in the good interest of Sri Lanka’s economy, the things that they should take ownership in and do anyways because it benefits the people, for instance, bringing more transparency into the debt-structuring process.  That’s something Sri Lanka shouldn’t do just because the IMF recommends it but it’s actually good for the country.  Now the measures, as they get implemented, will be tough.  There will be some tough measures and tough decisions that the Sri Lankan Government is going to have to take.  And I think the IMF and we as bilateral partners all want to make sure that as these steps are taken, the social safety net, the safety net for the most vulnerable and the poor are also addressed.  And as a major shareholder and voting partner at the IMF, the US and their Paris Club partners I think we’re all aligned on this.  We want to support the reform steps so, that Sri Lanka can get its economy back in order,” she added.    By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

A man opened fire on Abe, 67, from behind with an apparently homemade gun as he spoke at a drab traffic island in the western city of Nara, Japanese media showed earlier. It was the first assassination of a sitting or former Japanese Premier since the days of pre-war militarism in the 1930s. Speaking before Abe’s death was announced, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the shooting in the “strongest terms” while Japanese people and world leaders expressed shock at the violence in a country in which political violence is rare and guns are tightly controlled. “This attack is an act of brutality that happened during the elections – the very foundation of our democracy – and is absolutely unforgivable,” said Kishida, struggling to keep his emotions in check. A fire department official had said Abe appeared to be in a state of cardiac arrest when airlifted to hospital. Police said a 41-year-old man suspected of carrying out the shooting had been arrested. NHK quoted the suspect, identified as Tetsuya Yamagami, as telling Police he was dissatisfied with Abe and wanted to kill him. Abe was making a campaign speech outside a train station when two shots rang out at about 11:30 a.m. (0230 GMT). Security officials were then seen tackling a man in a grey T-shirt and beige trousers. “There was a loud bang and then smoke,” businessman Makoto Ichikawa, who was at the scene, told Reuters, adding that the gun was the size of a television camera. “The first shot, no one knew what was going on, but after the second shot, what looked like special police tackled him.” (Reuters)"

President of BASL, President’s Counsel Saliya Pieris, said although the 22nd Amendment does propose the establishment of  Constitutional Council ( CC) and Independent Commission, it does not guarantee the independence of the process of appointment of non-Parliamentary members of the CC as these members would be chosen with the approval of the majority in Parliament. “The proposed composition of the CC comprising a majority of Parliamentarians and the appointment process of its non-Parliamentarian members would affect the ability of the CC to act as a check and balance on the exercise of Presidential powers,” he said adding that this in turn would result in questions being raised on the independence of its decision- making on appointments to key offices and independent Commissions. He added it is vital to ensure the independence of key institutions including the judiciary and the Central Bank in order to restore political and economic stability. He further observed that the Monetary Board of the Central Bank has not been brought within the purview of the CC although the Governor of the Central Bank is included. Pieris added that the 22nd Amendment does not create sufficient checks and balances on the exercise of powers by the incumbent President under the current Parliament, since most of the provisions in the amendment which seek to limit the powers of the President will become operative only after the dissolution of the present Parliament. He said, at present,  several subjects and functions unrelated to defence including certain sectors vital to the economy such as Telecommunication and Information Technology are retained by the President, while raising concerns that the proposal to require the President to be the Minister-in- Charge of the subject of Defence without failing to circumscribe the subjects and functions which could fall under the defence portfolio, gives the President a pathway to retain to himself as Defence Minister subjects and functions which are not directly related to the defence of Sri Lanka.  He observed that the present provisions relating to appointment of Secretaries will also remain intact with the 22nd Amendment and that secretaries to Ministries should be appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister in consultation with the Cabinet of Ministers, as otherwise the President can wield authority through the Secretaries to Ministries and bypass the Ministers who have been appointed. “The 22nd Amendment will also continue to allow the President’s power to prorogue Parliament whenever the President wishes and to dissolve Parliament after two and a half years without the approval of Parliament. As such, the President will continue to retain an unhealthy control over Parliament alhough the dissolution of the present Parliament on an early date seems inevitable if there is to be political stability” he said. He thereby stated that introducing the 22nd Amendment and keeping the powers of the incumbent President intact will not be an answer to the demands put forward by the public. By Faadhila Thassim"

Executive Director of CEJ, Dilena Pathragoda noted that officials are attempting to justify the use of forest land for cultivation, whereas this could be a threat to such land while noting that there are abundant lands which are not forest lands that could be used for cultivation. Pathragoda made this statement in response to the instructions given by the Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera to officials to conduct a joint comprehensive survey of the lands under the Department of Forest Conservation that can be used for cultivation in the Trincomalee District. Amaraweera noted that certain regional secretaries have complained that a majority of the lands in the area have been marked as forest conservation lands, so the farmers have faced several issues due to a shortage of land for cultivation. He said, thereby in accordance with the decision of the Government to use all cultivable land for cultivation, such lands under the Department of Forest Conservation can be handed over, following a special joint public investigation conducted regarding such land. Accordingly, Amaraweera instructed the Secretary of the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Conservation Chandra Herath to take steps to conduct a joint public investigation of the forest conservation lands that can be used for cultivation in the Trincomalee District. Thereby a committee comprising representatives from the area’s agriculture, wildlife, forestry sectors together with residents from the area, will be appointed chaired by the Trincomalee District Secretary. He noted that no new land will be given for cultivation to any person who requests more land without cultivating the land on which he resides. Pathragoda thereby said if the objective is to provide land for cultivation purpose, officials should focus on using other abundant land as opposed to forest land. By Faadhila Thassim"

Enthusiastic individuals between the ages of 18 and 35 who are passionate about climate action and advocacy, are analytical, and demonstrate leadership qualities and innovation are strongly encouraged to apply for the programme by 15 July 2022. The United States Department of State, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Development Journalist Forum (SDJF), Genlab, Observer Research Foundation (ORF), and Pavilion Group, launched the Climate Action Champions Network (CACN) recently.  CACN will support 100 individuals from Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan as they lead climate action policies and initiatives in their respective countries, as well as the wider South Asia and Indo-Pacific Region. Climate change is a critical transnational threat, with South Asia being one of the most affected regions. CACN is a timely initiative that will raise awareness and encourage action. This programme will appoint 100 young individuals over a 12 -month period to work together to drive policy and programmes that combat climate change in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific Region. Commenting on the initiative, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung stated: “Climate-related challenges in South Asia cut across borders. The region’s ability to address the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change will have an enormous impact on youth populations. This is a fantastic opportunity for young change makers to influence policy and an initiative that will encourage young people to take an active role in promoting environmental conservation.” The cohort will work on specific thematic areas such as the green technology industry, climate change impact on biodiversity, climate-smart agriculture, climate finance, and climate change policymaking. They will also delve into the broader climate change and development agenda, examining how climate change intersects with developmental indicators such as gender, global health, and urbanization. “We are looking forward to receiving applications from promising individuals, and it is an enormous honour to be part of the steering committee for such a worthy cause. Climate change, a hot-button issue and a critical phenomenon that could surely determine the fate of humanity and its future course has been a prime concern, by and large, for all the nations irrespective of their political or economic agenda. As youth are crucial strata in virtually all societies, they are the most vibrant actors of the change and progress; when it comes to mitigating and addressing Climate Change, the same principle is valid. If you believe you are the change, this is the call for you. We will be at every guiding footstep of our young change makers and will provide the necessary support,” added Dr. Darshana Ashoka Kumara the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Development Journalist Forum, while taking the lead in delivering the message to the youth in Sri Lanka.

This is following the statement from Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Chairman of Litro gas that a grant of USD 70 million from the World Bank and USD 20 million from the Government had been reserved to import 100,000 MT of LP gas instead of buying from Siam Gas which sells at USD 96 per MT. “If funds are already assigned, why those funds cannot be utilised and negotiated with Siam Gas at USD 96,” an inside source told Ceylon Today. Several Litro gas agents know that Siam’s quotation is the lowest however due to vested interest Oman Trading Company has managed to renew its contract. If Siam Gas is selected USD 3.3 million could be saved which is around 3,800 MT of LPG to fill 304,000 cylinders which would be enough to solve the cooking needs of 3,000 households.  Litro Chairman Muditha Peries has not done any attempt to renegotiate with Siam gas as he is the silent agent of Oman Trading, it has been alleged.  “His first duty was to reinstate alleged corrupted Director of Procurement, Terrance Appuhamy who concluded all his corrupted transactions during his tenure in 2015 to 2020. It has come to light that Appuhamy had retired but was recalled by Peiris and reappointed to the post last week.  An efficient financial controller who was side-lined by Peiris led to bringing back H. Lakmali – Director Finance who was involving in the checks and balances in last two years after taking enormous salaries as exposed by COPE. Peiris has taken her to the pool last week.  Peiris alleged to have been previously backed by Ravi Karunanayake who is back in action in making deal,” sources allege. Siam Gas is probably one of the biggest LPG trading companies of Thailand conglomerate.  They have one of the largest vessel fleets in Asia with around 180 vessels. One cannot say they do not comply with vessels noted the reliable source as it is projected by vested parties. According to sources, SIAM operates its VLGC mother vessels in Dhamra Port in Kolkota India and their redistribution mainly in the west coast of India and Bangladesh,  hence, it’s one of the best choices to deal for energy supply noted the inside sources.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan "

The group of lawyers, together with locals, later staged an anti-Government protest in Galle whilst calling for an end to the violation of the freedom of expression. They noted that protests staged at the Galle Fort ramparts  had been obstructed on three consecutive days on the basis that the area has been declared a safety zone, adding that there is no legal basis for such reasoning and that no Court order has been obtained to obstruct protesters. They further said a complaint will be lodged with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) while a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition will also be filed against the Police officers who disrupted them on Friday (1). Previously, protesters also strongly confronted the military personnel, who tried to grab the placards, asking how military can interfere with civilians in such a manner. Meanwhile, a Fundamental Rights petition was filed by a group of lawyers at the Supreme Court on Friday (1) against the disruption of protests, on 30 June on the Galle Fort ramparts, by lawyers, civil society activists and locals by forcibly grabbing their placards and banners and threatening them to leave. As the second day of the first Test match between Australia and Sri Lanka on Thursday (30 June) was delayed due to the adverse weather, a group of protesters started chanting anti-Government slogans including ‘Go home Gota’ on the city side of the Galle Fort ramparts overlooking the Galle stadium when they were removed by military personnel. The petitioners noted the said protest did not cause any disturbance whatsoever to the cricket match, to its spectators or other tourists visiting the Galle Fort. They further said the protesters were verbally abused and threatened by officers of the Sri Lanka Army in the presence of the Police officers, and thus the said conduct of the officers amount to an infringement of the freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment as guaranteed to them by Article 11 of the Constitution. The Petitioners stated that the use of Army personnel to disrupt peaceful protests protected by the law, is an infringement of the right to equality and the equal protection of the law as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution. ‘’The conduct of the military personnel in such a manner amounts to disgraceful and dishonorable conduct and is damaging to the reputation of the reputation of the Sri Lanka Army and outside its scope and ambit and should not be permitted,” the petitioners noted. Among other relief sought, petitioners sought for compensation of Rs 5,000,000 payable by one or more or all of the Respondents. Further, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) also opposed the removal of protesters noting that there is no lawful reason to disperse protesters as the said location is a public area.

In particular, the Minister said that the Sri Lankan media has repeatedly raised the issue accusing him as the Subject Minister and the Government on delays in the project. The Japanese Ambassador said he had been informed that project work had been delayed due to the Covid-19 Pandemic and Sri Lanka’s fuel crisis and pointed out that several other foreign companies engaged in the construction industry in Sri Lanka have also faced the situation. The Ambassador expressed his confidence to resolve the matter soon and urged the Minister to sustain strong ties and credibility secured and continued between the two nations. Mentioning that 65 per cent of the payments for the Phase II BIA expansion project are being done using Japanese Yen, the Minister inquired if the Government could facilitate to open a discussion with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation if such foreign exchange could be used to purchase fuel required for construction work from foreign exporters.

The public has a right to know about it,” he added. Premadasa alleged the concealment of such information portray that the Government led by the President has entered into a number of secret agreements with multinational corporations in the recent past. Meanwhile, JVP Politburo member and former COPE Chairman, Sunil Handunnetti, said if COPE members are concealing video footage of a meeting, it is more serious than the statement made by the former CEB Chairman. Handunnetti made this remark following the controversy which erupted after COPE decided to postpone releasing the full video of the special committee meeting on Thursday (23) in which former CEB Chairman Ferdinando testified for the second time. Speaking to Ceylon Today on Friday (24), Handunnetti said if video footage cannot be made public, then there is something to hide. The decision to give a live stream was made because citizens need transparency. Parliamentary matters cannot be shrouded in secrecy, he said. “We even found out about the things that were hidden from Parliament by the Central Bank. COPE is the place where people can find out what happens to their money. If they are hiding things, something strange is going on. When I was the COPE Chairman, I started giving live broadcasts as I did not want to conceal anything.

A ministry official told Ceylon Today, having made such humongous losses, no airline will take over management of SriLankan, and hence the Government has encouraged a joint venture or public-private partnership (PPP). Presently, all SriLankan Airlines planes are on lease and that too will need to be renewed or returned. However, there are no sufficient funds for that. According to the PM, after the interim budget, steps should be taken towards privatising SriLankan.

Attygalle, and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were among the 13 respondents named in the petition. The Petition was filed against the lack of accountability and transparency in high-level decision-making that has resulted in the present crisis, while citing a number of factors leading to the crisis. The factors cited in the Petition is the reduction in government revenue caused by the illegal and arbitrary tax breaks granted in 2019, failure to reverse the illegal tax break, failure to take remedial measures subsequent to rating downgrades, failure to devalue the Sri Lankan Rupee in a timely, orderly, and appropriate manner despite widespread calls to do so, the decision to continue servicing sovereign debt without any restructuring, and the refusal to seek the assistance of the IMF until the crisis had exacerbated. The Petitioners argue that the fundamental rights of the citizens to equality, freedom of expression, and the right to information guaranteed under the Constitution have been violated through the actions or inactions of the respondents. The petitioners noted that the respondents named in the petition are directly responsible for the unsustainability of Sri Lanka’s foreign debt, its hard default on foreign loan repayments, and the present state of the economy of Sri Lanka. Further, they said the inaction of the respondents has led to the present shortages of food, medicine, fuel and gas in the country, victimising the entire population in an unprecedented manner. (FT)"

Wishma Sandamali, 33, died in March 2021 at a facility run by the bureau, in a case that sparked widespread outcry over her mistreatment. The Nagoya District Public Prosecutors Office launched an investigation into whether the senior officials in charge at the time had committed murder or negligence as a guardian resulting in death, responding to criminal complaints against them from Wishma’s family and others. The Prosecutor’s Office reportedly concluded it cannot establish criminal liability in this case following discussions with another prosecution office that is higher in rank. The decision is expected to be communicated to those who made the criminal complaints, including Wishma’s family members, on Friday (17) at the earliest. This will effectively end the investigation into criminal liability of the senior officials. According to a report compiled by the Immigration Services Agency in August last year, Wishma came to Japan as a student in June 2017. She was held at the detention facility after being arrested for overstaying her visa in August 2020. Her health rapidly deteriorated in the facility and she started to complain about loss of appetite and nausea from mid-January 2021. Her urine test showed that she was in a state of starvation on 15 February 2021, 19 days before her death. After that, she became even more ill and died on 6 March 2021. The report admitted that Wishma died of an illness, but also said “multiple factors might have caused her death and it is difficult to determine which one was the cause.” Her family members maintain, however, that she would not have died had she received proper medical treatment, such as with an intravenous drip or hospitalisation. In November 2021, they lodged a criminal complaint with the Nagoya District Public Prosecutors Office against the then Chief of the Bureau, the person who acted as the Chief Guard at the detention facility on the day of her death, and other officials. They argued that the officials committed murder thorough wilful negligence and did not care if she died. Earlier, in June 2021, a member of the teaching staff at a university in Nagoya had lodged a criminal complaint with the same district Public Prosecutor’s Office against the bureau’s officials, alleging their conduct amounted to death through aggravated abandonment. Wishma’s family members are also seeking around 156 million yen (US$ 1.17 million) in damages from the State and that case is still ongoing at the Nagoya District Court. (The Asahi Shimbun)"

The long hours that the surgeons and other theatre and hospital staff have to spend in queues, due to the fuel crisis, could result in these services shutting down. Surgeons, especially those who have to use their private transport to reach the hospital have to stay for 13 to 14 hours in fuel queues to obtain the fuel.

All we are asking from the Government, the petrol shed owners and even the public is to show some consideration towards Apeksha Hospital because the patients’ lives have been affected by this.” It runs the risk of shutting down and unless the Government, assisted by the public, help find a solution to this situation and delays that eat into the time of their service. “Even trade unions don’t implement their action in the Apeksha Hospital, the hospital for patients with cancer, so please assist the hospital to function at this time of crisis as well,” he urged.      By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Allegations of SPC The controversy was unfolded after the SPC and the Medical Supplies Division of the Ministry of Health were summoned before COPE in the first week of June. The SPC told COPE has poured Rs 644 million into the drain for inventory management software that does not accommodate its requirements. They said the software took seven years to build and implement. The contract was granted to a local company and the software had been started to be developed from 2008 and was only been implemented in 2015. In response to inquiries by COPE’s Chairman, the SPC representative said that the institution makes a payment of Rs 5 million monthly as maintenance even though the software does not work as intended, pointing out that only some entries can be put into the system. Furthermore, the University of Colombo School of Computing estimated it would cost Rs 7 billion to upgrade the existing system to one that fulfills the requirements of the SPC. Response from the EWIS Sri Lanka Calling a media briefing the next day, the EWIS Sri Lanka refuted the allegation and claimed the cost for the total project was Rs 223 million. The company said only Rs 83 million was spent on the software developed for the Medical Supplies Division and the cost for the total project was Rs 223 million. Company Chairman Sanjeewa Wickramanayake said, 45,000 purchase orders have been placed through this system since 2015, while 950 purchase orders were placed from January 2020 to date. “If this system is not working properly as the SPC claimed at COPE, how did they place orders through this system? Some Rs 4.9 million was due after the warranty ended. The warranty ended on 23 October 2020. From November, they paid us Rs 4.9 million, not from 2015,” Wickramanayake said. Speaking further, the Chairman said from 2015 to 2017, for two years, the system was maintained without any other payments, and as per the contract, from 2017 to 2020 the warranty period of three years was given, adding that Rs 4.9 million maintenance fee of 83 hospitals per month was given to EWIS Sri Lanka from November 2020. Wickramanayake also said, a clarification pertaining to the matter has been submitted to COPE. Following these statements, confusion has arisen as to who pilfered Rs 421 million of public money. More confusion After the company’s clarification letter to the COPE, the committee issued a statement. The figures of this statement cause more confusion as the figures provided by the company and the State Ministry of Health do not tally. The COPE said EWIS Information Systems Ltd informed they were paid Rs 223 million for the software. However, the written submission of the State Ministry of Health shows that a colossal amount of money has been paid to two companies operated under EWIS. The State Ministry’s statement shows while EWIS Information Systems Ltd had been paid Rs 458 million, another company named EWIS Solutions (Pvt) Ltd had been paid Rs 66 million. Therefore, a total of Rs 524 million had been paid for the said software. As the confusion is growing further, the COPE instructed the Auditor General to conduct a special investigation and submit a report within a month. It is unfortunate that this type of news come to the light, when the public is paying for their lives because of medicinal drug shortage in the country. It does not need to say over and over that the crisis situation of the country is created by the mismanagement of economy and public funds.  The public needs accountability and transparency to watch how the officials are spending their money. Therefore, the authorities are obliged to give proper answer to the public in light of the above findings. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

The case was convened before a Trial-at-Bar, comprising Judges Sanjeewa Moraes, Mahen Weeraman and Damith Thotawatta. The nine suspects, whose bail was revoked by the Bench, were identified as Karunaratne, W.D. Upasena, R.M.P.K. Rajapaksa, S.M. Ravindra Rupasena, Chaminda Abeyratne, Kanishka Guneratne, I. Balasubramanium, Tharanga Gamage and T.E.R. Peiris. The Court having perused the contradictory nature of the testimony, given by witness former LTTE intelligence unit member Thiru Kumar, ordered to rescind the bail granted to the aforesaid suspects and for their immediate arrest and incarceration. Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris prosecuted on behalf of the Attorney General’s Department, while Attorney-at-Law Upul Kumarapperuma appeared for the aggrieved party. He stated that before hearing testimony from the witness, it should be probed whether the defence had exerted any undue pressure on the witness. DSG Peiris stated that the prosecution was not opposed to it and explained that when a warrant had been issued on the witness over his failure to be present in Court previously, the witness had not got involved with the prosecution and had subsequently appeared in Court via a President’s Counsel. He remarked that this had further proved, that more than the prosecution, pressure had been exerted on the witnesses by external forces and he too backed the request made by the aggrieved party. Taking the submissions into consideration, the Court ordered to record evidence from the witness and warned that if in that process it is confirmed that the witness had been intimidated, then bail granted to the suspects will be ordered to be rescinded and order for their prompt arrest and remanding. Accordingly, the recording of evidence from the witness, took place and he stated that till he had gone to the CID, he had not known who Prageeth Ekneligoda was. The witness said that he had by-hearted a few statements that had been given to him by the CID, ahead of their recording it. The witness further told the Court, that a statement that had been given by him previously to the Homagama Chief Magistrate’s Court, as per Provisions contained in Section 127 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He added that after providing the statement to the Court, the Magistrate had not read it back to him. Afterwards, the prosecution stated that based on the evidence given by the witness, it was amply clear that the latter had provided evidence against the CID, as well as a top official of the Judiciary and that it could be surmised, that there has been some form of pressure exerted on the witness. The prosecution then urged to issue an order for the imprisonment of the witness, to ensure his safety and noted that there should be recourse for a witness, to provide his or her testimony in Court without fear or favour. Taking the submissions into consideration, the Bench dismissed the request for the incarceration of the witness and ordered the bail granted to the nine suspects to be promptly revoked and for their arrest and imprisonment till 13 June. The AG has indicted nine suspects before the Trial-at-Bar on 17 counts and on charges of the forced abduction and disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda on or before 25 January, 12 years ago, and for having flouted Provisions contained in Sections of the Penal Code via their actions.

This group of MPs are from main and minority parties in Parliament. However, election monitoring bodies said, Sri Lanka lacks a mechanism to find out which MP holds dual citizenship, and this helps them go undetected. MP Basil Rajapaksa has publicly said before the last General Election that he is a US citizen and will not renounce his dual citizenship. MP Diana Gamage also said she has a UK passport. MP Geetha Kumarasinghe lost her Parliamentary seat in 2017 as a result of a Court of Appeal decision that she was not eligible to hold office because she is a dual citizen. The 19th Amendment had clauses to prevent dual citizens from holding parliamentary seats. However, the 20th Amendment which was ratified by the present Government removed that clause.

They also said, this decision to ground the Aeroflot flight had been taken while top-ranking diplomatic officials of the two countries had reached a written understanding not to ban any Russian flights from leaving Colombo when they arrive here. It is also learnt that the bulk of overseas tourists are sent to Sri Lanka by Russia and a BIA source revealed that close to 400,000 Russians were planning to arrive in Colombo during the forthcoming winter season. Hence, BIA sources said, the decision to ground the Russian flight at the BIA as per a Court order could have drastic consequences for Sri Lanka, both politically and economically. Meanwhile, Colombo Commercial High Court Judge Harsha Sethunga stated on Friday that the trial with regard to the injunction issued by the Court, to ground an Aeroflot flight heading from Katunayake to Moscow, will be taken up on 8 June. He gave this order, having perused a request made to him by the Russian firm owning the aircraft and the Chief Controller of the Katunayake Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). ASG Sumathi Dharmawardene appeared on behalf of the second suspect in the case, the Chief Air Traffic Controller of the Katunayake CAA. ASG Dhamarawardene told Judge Sethunga, the Government of Sri Lanka is duty-bound to provide necessary facilities to all international flights that arrive at the BIA, as well as for their safe return to their destinations, as per international agreements signed and based on air traffic control regulations. He further mentioned, the Court has not been empowered by law, to issue injunctions to ban flights, from leaving the country. Responding to the submission, Judge Harsha Sethunga, remarked that no injunction has been issued on the Air Traffic Controller of the CAA at Katunayake. The Court had issued an injunction on 2 June, having perused a petition filed by Celestial Aviation Trading Private Limited situated in Ireland. The firm stated that the airline which had arrived at the BIA belonged to it and stated that till the necessary payments that are required to be paid to it, the airline concerned should not be allowed to leave the BIA and to impose an injunction on it. The order issued by the Court stated that the injunction will be valid till 16 June. By T.K.G. Kapila (Katunayake) and Hansi Nanayakkara"

The funds were received for Covid-19 control from donors during the height of the pandemic. The President said, the money could be used for health needs as the pandemic was now under control. Holding discussion at the President’s House in Colombo, regarding matters of urgent concern in the health sector, he said that 234 types of medicines required for hospitals were manufactured locally. With drug prices increasing in the world market sharply, the President pointed out the possibility of increasing the production of local pharmaceuticals by obtaining the necessary raw materials under Indian credit line. Officials present at the discussions noted that there were 12 investors in the pharmaceutical sector in the Oyamaduwa and Millewa area in Horana. The production in those factories was expected to begin in the next few months and has the potential to produce more than 200 types of drugs. The importation of medicines and medical equipment was being funded by several sources. It is planned to allocate the required funds from the proposed budget as well. The Officials said they were hopeful that the health service would recover within the next three months based on its current progress.

While the SPC claimed at the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) that Rs 644 million was paid to EWIS Sri Lanka for the software that does not meet its requirements, the company claimed the cost for the total project wasRs 223 million. The SPC said so, when the SPC and the Medical Supplies Division of the Ministry of Health were summoned before COPE last week. They said, the software took seven years to develop and implement. The contract was granted to a local company and the software was developed from 2008 and had only been implemented in 2015. In response to queries by the COPE Chairman, the SPC representative said, the institution makes a payment of Rs 5 million monthly as a maintenance fee, even though the software does not work as intended, pointing out that only some entries can be made into the system. Furthermore, the University of Colombo School of Computing estimated it would cost Rs 7 billion to upgrade the existing system to one that fulfils the requirements of the SPC. However, speaking at a media briefing on Friday (3), a representative of EWIS Sri Lanka said only Rs 83 million was spent on the software developed for the Medical Supplies Division and the cost for the total project was Rs 223 million. Company Chairman Sanjeewa Wickramanayake said, 45,000 purchase orders have been placed through this system since 2015, while 950 purchase orders were placed from January 2020 to date. “If this system is not working properly as the SPC claimed at COPE, how did they place orders through this system? Some Rs 4.9 million was due after the warranty ended. The warranty ended on 23 October 2020. From November, they paid us Rs 4.9 million, not from 2015,” Wickramanayake said. Speaking further, the Chairman said from 2015 to 2017, for two years, the system was maintained without any other payments, and as per the contract, from 2017 to 2020 the warranty period of three years was given, adding that the Rs 4.9 million maintenance fee of 83 hospitals per month was given to EWIS Sri Lanka from November 2020. Wickramanayake also said, a clarification pertaining to the matter has been submitted to COPE. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

The President pointed out that this could prevent the organised efforts of some businessmen to increase prices by pretending to have a shortage of goods. The President made these remarks at a discussion held at the President’s House in Colombo on 2 June, on finding expeditious solutions to the challenges related to trade, commerce and food security. “A portion of the agricultural produce distributed to the wholesale market should be made available directly to the rural market. This would reduce the cost of transportation and enable rural consumers to purchase goods at lower prices as well as an opportunity for farmers to obtain higher prices,” he said. President Rajapaksa instructed the Consumer Affairs Authority to take legal action against those who take advantage of the prevailing situation and trade at unfair prices. There was a lengthy discussion on the need to keep Lanka Sathosa and Co-operative outlets islandwide active and to control the prices of essential food items without allowing prices to be set at the discretion of traders.

He was responding to a query at a forum on the country’s present crisis, held by the Association of Constructive Professionals (ACP) with Rakimu Jayathu Lanka. Wickremesinghe speaking about the fuel and resource shortages in the country said, he not only has to be the Premier, but also a firefighter with the escalating crisis, looking for at least US$ 40 million daily for fuel shipment payments. “There are two crises affecting Sri Lanka. Firstly, it is the economic crisis and political crisis. A loss of confidence in our political system is responsible for the dire situation at present. The second crisis is the global impact of the Russia-Ukraine War, and Sri Lanka is only seeing the beginning,” he added. Wickremesinghe said, Sri Lanka didn’t approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) early enough. Furthermore, Wickremesinghe said, the food supplies in Sri Lanka will last only until September or October this year, as we don’t have sufficient fertiliser for either the Yala or Maha seasons. Wickremesinghe assured if the country receives fertiliser for the next Maha Season, it will be self-sufficient by February next year. (Pic by Kelum Chamara) By Nabiya Vaffoor"

The inaugural phase of Project Saubhagya mainly focused on the female reproductive system. A timely webinar titled ‘Female Reproductive Health, Menstruation Cycle and Associated Diseases’, was conducted by Dr. Oshadhi Nallaperuma (MBBS (Pdn), MD in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Col), Head (Act) Lecturer, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. The 2-hour session of the first phase of Project Saubhagya was attended by 160+ participants and saw a well-rounded discussion that highlighted the ever-growing need for the discourse on the topic of SRHR to be de-stigmatised. All activities around the phase, including social media posts, emphasised female health and well-being, aspects regarding common diseases that disadvantage women such as PCOS, HPV, misconceptions, taboos, and myths surrounding the female reproductive system. Some health conditions discussed during the session are as follows: PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) PCOS affects nearly 10-15% of the female population in the world, with the Asian female population being very predisposed to this condition. This is a hormonal imbalance in the body where there is a high amount of male sex hormones. Symptoms of PCOS are excess thick-dark body hair (hirsutism), acne, loss or thinning of the scalp hair in a ‘male-like’ pattern, and truncal obesity (excessive fat around the abdomen), and infrequent and irregular periods. Women with PCOS appear to be at increased risk of developing the following health conditions: subfertility, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular disorders (if you have PCOS for a long period, it might increase the chances of strokes or heart attacks later in life), endometrial cancer and psychotic disorders. The effects of PCOS and its prevalence can be controlled with a proper diet plan and exercises. Endometriosis Endometriosis happens when tissue, similar to the lining of the endometrium, grows outside the uterus. The tissue usually grows in the pelvic area, including the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, tissues that support the uterus, and the outside of the uterus. This causes common symptoms including severe cramps, heavy periods, pelvic pain, and lower back pain. Complications of endometriosis include infertility, ovarian cancer, ovarian cyst, inflammation, and intestinal and bladder complications. There is currently no cure for endometriosis, but drugs can help manage pain. Some people may need surgery. HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) HPV is a DNA virus that can lead to certain cancers in both males and females. There are different types of viruses. Some of them spread through direct sexual contact with someone who has the virus. The virus can also spread through other intimate, skin-to-skin contact. Some people develop warts around their genitals, anus, mouth, or throat from HPV infections. Some HPV can also cause cancers in the cervix, vagina, anus, or penis. For women, there are Cervical Cancer screening tests that can find changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. As part of the screening, women may have PAP tests, which are freely available at any Well Women Clinic. The HPV vaccine is available and recommended for any female above the age of 14, before they reach a stage of sexual activity, in order to reduce the risk of cervical cancer.

Commenting on the landmark achievement, HNB Managing Director/CEO, Jonathan Alles said:    “HNB was founded on the principle that true partnerships built on integrity and service can only lead to progress. Over 134 years, we have carried this legacy forward with an equal sense of pride and responsibility to build upon the progress of generations. These values have led the bank to constantly transform its capabilities, and evolve with the times, in order to be of service to as many Sri Lankans as possible in good times and bad.  To be recognised for the 12th occasion as Sri Lanka’s Best Retail Bank, is of course an incredible validation of this legacy, and the dedicated efforts of our entire team. Looking ahead, we face unprecedented challenges but within these issues, are also the seeds of a better future. The entire HNB team remains steadfast in our commitment to serve the people of Sri Lanka as a true partner in progress.”  Retail banking is a flagship segment for HNB, which caters to the needs of over 2.5 million Sri Lankans islandwide. In addition to the bank’s extensive customer service network of 255 branches and 795 Self Service Machines, HNB has also been a pioneer in leveraging digital banking products, services and channels to provide customers with convenient, comprehensive and secured options to transact remotely. Parallel to these efforts, the bank has been driving pioneering improvements in its customer service capabilities, which have been scaled up by the implementation of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to establish automated chat services. This enables customers to gain easy access to information about HNB’s extensive range of products and services, including extensive assistance and support on any issues they may run into.  Over the past year, the bank delivered another strong and stable performance despite significant challenges, as reflected in the bank’s strong growth in Current Account, Savings Account (CASA) deposits. Meanwhile, the bank added three new products to its retail banking portfolio including a Premier Current Account, Investment Plans for adults and children and a Teen + savings account with the linked debit card allowing teens to manage and track their finances. The bank’s leadership status in tech-enabled banking has resulted in the launch of a series of breakthrough platforms like HNB SOLO – a frictionless, one-stop-shop for digital payments linked through bank accounts, credit, or debit cards that is rapidly gaining popularity – particularly in the context of a post-COVID landscape. The app functions as a versatile e-wallet which provides the ability to make payments through scanning of Lanka QR codes, in addition to providing SOLO users with access to a range of exclusive deals, and gift coupons through merchants, as well as the option of paying utility bills directly through SOLO. New features have also been added to SOLO in recent months, including Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transfers, wallet features, and card-less ATM withdrawals.      Meanwhile, HNB’s Digital Banking app continues to gain ground, with more than 300,000 active users now on board, and the app itself being among the highest rated banking applications in Sri Lanka. HNB is also constantly refining the app’s robust capabilities including the most recent addition of a new feature for opening and closing of fixed deposits. Moving forward, HNB is aiming to further consolidate its leadership in digital banking through the implementation of a multipurpose Digital Layer that allows the bank to launch Digital Banking products swiftly to the market. This has enabled the bank to work closely with Fintechs for rapid roll out of new tech-enabled products and services. “With the commencement of our state-of-the-art back-end transformation, HNB is rapidly gearing up for the expansion of our service capabilities. This will also bolster the bank’s ability to support the revival and rejuvenation of the national economy, in turn empowering our customers to pursue their dreams. The investments  we have committed towards technology, and building the expertise of our people, are laying the foundation for a drastically more reliable, responsive, remotely accessible banking experience that fulfils our promise to deliver seamless banking solutions to our customers wherever they are,” HNB DGM – Retail and SME Banking, Sanjay Wijemanne said. HNB is among Sri Lanka’s most awarded banks, having been ranked among the Banker Magazine’s Top 1,000 Global Banks for five consecutive years as well as being adjudged Best Retail and SME Bank at the International Finance Awards 2021, and as being ranked among Sri Lanka’s Most Admired Companies for the 4th consecutive year.

Hosted by the Asian FinTech Academy (AFTA), the forum recognised and awarded organisations and impactful individuals who drive innovation in the digital sphere.  The digitally-savvy bank further consolidated its position at the LankaPay Technnovation Awards 2022, where it bagged four top awards.

Consultant Community Physician, NDCU,Dr. Nimalka Pannilahetti, on Friday (3) said the NDCU had appealed to the Ministry of Housing and local governments to instruct building companies and contractors to inform the Medical Officer of Health (MoH) so that they could brief them on measures to be taken to prevent and control mosquito breeding. She lamented however that they were yet to receive a response.    Director NDCU, Dr. Sudath Samaraweera, said with the present economic difficulties and the high cost of building materials, many building constructions had been halted. These sites contain utensils such as buckets and barrels that are presently not being used, in which collected water provides breeding grounds for mosquitoes. “Contractors and owners of these places should be vigilant and clean up the places,” he said. Dr. Samaraweera said from the beginning of this year till the end of May, Sri Lanka had reported a total of 24,523 dengue cases. May has the highest number, while on 1 June 313 cases were recorded. He urged the public to rid their homes, schools, workplaces, religious and other public places of all breeding grounds. The adverse North Westerly weather conditions have resulted in a marked increase in dengue. “We may have forgotten the threat which dengue has posed to the country in the past with Covid-19. Having successfully controlled the pandemic, we have resumed our day-to-day activities,” he said, adding that the public should not forget that dengue still poses a serious threat to the country’s health service. She appealed to the public to seek urgent medical attention 24 hours after the onset of fever. She said the delay in seeking medical care had been one of the primary factors contributing to dengue deaths. Responding to queries, she said the Unit had said the dengue death toll was more than what had been experienced by June 2021. As was confirmed by the NDCU, by the end of last week, the number of dengue deaths was over twenty.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

ACMOA Co-Convenor, Dr. Jayantha Bandara, when contacted, warned on Friday (27), the Health Ministry would be given time only till 30 May before the ACMOA wages a series of trade union action starting with a protest. He accused MPs of wasting over Rs 9 million to cry over their losses in Parliament last week. “While education and health have suffered severe blows due to the economic crisis, fuel shortages led to the closure of schools without even conducting term tests,” he accused. Dr. Bandara said, the collapse of the health system has led to a highly dangerous situation in the country. The shortage of medicines, the difficulty in obtaining fuel, the transport service which is being carried out at an excessive cost, and the slashing of salaries of the State health services, were all signs of its collapse. At present, a large number of drugs affecting every field of medicine are either scarce or almost unavailable. Anaesthetics required for patients undergoing surgery, medicines required for patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), essential drugs used in the treatment of patients with diabetes, hypertension, cancer and other non-communicable diseases, reagents for lab testing  and several pharmacological and therapeutic and essential equipment are all in shortage. Dr. Bandara said, the Government had resorted to a heartless method to manage its loss of income. He said, it resulted in the slashing of their wages by cutting of Extra Duty Payments and the other allowances which were paid to health employees if it exceeded their basic salary. He urged the Government to reimburse the slashed amounts which were hard-earned and take immediate measures to annul the controversial circular which had contributed to a further crisis in the health service.    By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

K. Stalin welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Tamil Nadu on 26 May, and reiterated that only by restoring India’s sovereignty over Katchativu will a permanent solution to their fishermen’s issue in Sri Lanka be possible. Prime Minister Modi was in Tamil Nadu to launch development initiatives in Chennai, when Chief Minister made this request. Also, Tamil Nadu President of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) K. Annamalai, who recently visited Sri Lanka addressed a gathering in Chennai on 18 May where he stated that the Indian government has already requested the Sri Lankan government to allow Indian fishermen to fish around Kachchativu. Speaking at a meeting, he added that while India gifted the island to Sri Lanka, there was a clause that allowed Indian fishermen to fish around the island; however, that clause was later removed, he told the audience. He also claimed that traditional south Indian fishermen had been fishing around this island and are now ‘barred,’ so that clause should be removed to allow them to fish as well. He stated that this is the only way to resolve the fishermen’s dispute. However, Annamalai did not lobby India to take the island back from Sri Lanka. Also when Stalin visited New Delhi to meet Modi on 1 April 2022, there too he mentioned about retrieving Kachchativu. He submitted a memorandum to Modi consisting 14 demands on various issues including retrieving Katchativu, among many other domestic demands. At that time Stalin requested the Centre to advise the Sri Lankan government to ensure equal political and civil rights to the Eelam Tamils. He said due to the ongoing economic crisis in the island nation, many Sri Lankan Tamils are fleeing to Tamil Nadu by sea. “Recently, 16 Sri Lankans reached the shores of Tamil Nadu. They embarked on the perilous journey due to unaffordable essential commodities in Sri Lanka. In a bid to protect the traditional fishing rights of the Indian fishermen in the Palk Bay and to ensure their safety and security, Stalin asked the Centre to address the Sri Lankan government to end the arrest and apprehension of fishermen. In the memorandum, it was noted that Tamil Nadu fishermen are often arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy while fishing in their traditional waters in the pretext of crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line.  “During the past 11 years, 3,690 fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy and 3,644 fishermen were released and repatriated to Tamil Nadu. The remaining 46 fishermen were released recently and are yet to be repatriated,” Stalin noted. He said it is imperative to continue the Joint Working Group (JWG) meetings and also the fishermen level talks between the fishermen of the two countries, which has not been held since 2016. Northern Tamils of Sri Lanka have been demanding the Indian fishermen to keep away from their livelihood and not to fish using bottom trawlers. The clash between the fishermen of Tamil Nadu and northern fishermen of Sri Lanka erupted after the war ended in 2009 and gradually it turned out to be a diplomatic dispute between India and Sri Lanka where both governments have been trying to solve the issue.

However, Dissanayake said the amendments shouldn’t turn out to be a hoax. Speaking to the Media on 27 May at JVP Headquarters, Dissanayake presented some proposals to be included in the 21st Amendment. He said the President should not be able to hold any ministerial portfolio as stated in the 19th Amendment. He also said provisions should be made in this constitutional amendment to prevent MPs from switching sides. While claiming that the President has been empowered to pardon anyone and release those sentenced to death or life imprisonment, he said the President’s powers should be curtailed. He also emphasised the term of this Parliament should be shortened by including an interim provision in this amendment. “Our proposal is to limit the term of the Ninth Parliament to two to three years. After that, the people will have the opportunity to elect Parliamentarians and a Prime Minister through a fresh Parliamentary Election. Such a Parliament and a Prime Minister should be empowered by the 21st Amendment,” he said. “The President has proved that he is not fit for office, but constitutionally and under the 20th Amendment he has the right to hold that position. However, the 21st Amendment gives the Prime Minister some of the powers vested in him,” he further added. He said as the Prime Minister has new powers in Parliament, the people must be given the opportunity to elect a new Parliament and a new Prime Minister to exercise that power.

Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda has played a critical role in the understanding and conservation of the astonishing freshwater fish diversity of Sri Lanka and the region more broadly, through original research and support for others. Together with colleagues at WHT, Pethiyagoda has been responsible for the discovery and/or description of almost 100 new species of vertebrates from Sri Lanka, including fishes, amphibians and lizards, in addition to 43 species of freshwater crabs. This work also led to the finding that some 19 species of Sri Lankan amphibians have become extinct in the past 130 years, the highest national extinction record in the world. Several new species have been named in his honour, including the fishes Dawkinsia rohani and Rasboroides rohani; the microhylid frog Uperodon rohani; the dragon lizard Calotes pethiyagodai; the jumping spider Onomastus pethiyagodai and the dragonfly Macromidia donaldi pethiyagodai. In 2020, a team of scientists led by S. D. Biju named a new genus of South and Southeast Asian tree frogs Rohanixalus in Pethiyagoda’s honour. In July 2012, Pethiyagoda and colleagues named a genus of South Asian freshwater fishes Dawkinsia in honour of the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, following which Pethiyagoda told AFP that “Richard Dawkins has through his writings helped us understand that the universe is far more beautiful and awe-inspiring than any religion has imagined”. Pethiyagoda also named the freshwater cyprinid genus Haludaria after the Begali youth known only as Haludar, who illustrated the fishes depicted in Francis Hamilton’s (1822) “Fishes of the Ganges”, the founder work of Indian ichthyology. The Linnean Medal may be seen as the Nobel Prize for naturalists. The Linnean Medal was instituted in May 1888 in connection with the Centenary of the Society in the same year."

This is due to adapting to wasteful and unproductive practices of other countries. It is possible to reduce the cost to purchase drugs by five times without wasting money on the so-called impractical grounds,” he said.

Litro officials were summoned on Friday (20), before COPE, following a request by Prime Minister Ranil Wickeremesinghe. The PM said he needed a report on the delay of distributing gas this week despite instructions.The officials told the COPE that the delay was caused by bad weather conditions. As a result the buoy could not be connected to Muthurajawela plant and the shipment had to be taken to the Colombo Port. However, the company would be able to restore the supply without any further delay, they said. It was also revealed during the meeting that apart from the forex crisis, halting of the term tenders to purchase gas on 28 February was the reason for the current gas shortage in the country. The term tenders were halted following the instructions of the Finance Ministry. The Ministry informed to halt the tenders as it was working to purchase gas from another company, the officials said. It was discussed in-depth whether the Finance Ministry gave this instruction in writing. The COPE said that the company officials will be summoned again to discuss this matter further. Furthermore, the officials told the COPE that Rs 15 billion possessed by the company has dried up as a result of the failure to increase gas prices in accordance with the global market prices. This caused huge losses and owing to this, the company is in debt to the tune of Rs 11 billion to the banks. The company will use USD120 million from the Indian credit line of USD 160 million to purchase gas. With this arrangement the gas shortage in the local market will be resolved and gas supplies would be good enough for three months. Litro Chairman Wijitha Herath said, the company expects to use USD 80 million loan from the World Bank for term tenders.  The COPE instructed the company to take immediate steps to resolve the current gas crisis and look into the possibility of obtaining financial assistance from Sri Lanka Insurance under which the company operates.  It was also advised that the Litro hotline 1311 be made a service that operates 24/7.

MP Fernando took oath as Minister of Tourism and Land, whereas MP Nanayakkara was sworn in as Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment. Subsequently, the newly-appointed Minister of Tourism and Land, Fernando claimed he did not betray his party. Speaking at a media briefing on 20 May he said SJB supporters will understand the reasons behind his decision in time. “Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe agreed to the eight points we presented, first is the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The safety of the GotaGoGama protesters has to be assured. Politicians have to make sacrifices. There has to be an anti-corruption legislation to be passed in Parliament. We request expatriates to invest in Sri Lanka and we will do our utmost to bring back tourists,” said Fernando. Fernando added that he will step down from his post if the Prime Minister Wickremesinghe fails to fulfil these demands. Meanwhile, Nanayakkara also assured that while they continue to work as ministers, they will also criticise the Government, if they detect any wrong move, without hesitation. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

The funds will be used by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to provide food assistance to children and families in need of support. Charge d’Affaires ad interim of the Japanese Embassy Kotaro Katsuki said, “We are pleased to announce that the Government of Japan (GoJ) will grant  US$ 1.5 million emergency assistance through WFP to provide three months’ essential food supplies, including fortified rice, dhal and oil, for approximately 15,000 urban and rural people and 380,000 schoolchildren islandwide. Japan has been extending vital protein to children through the provision of canned fish made in Japan worth a total of US$ 10 million as school meal programmes over the past 10 years. We hope that this humanitarian assistance will help improve food access and nutrition for the people of Sri Lanka amid the economic crisis.”  Sri Lanka has been severely impacted by a weakening economy, which has resulted in shortages of essential items, including food, and a spike in food prices, hindering families’ access to affordable, healthy meals, the Embassy said. Even before the pandemic, malnutrition rates were high among children and women. Some 40 per cent of primary-age children were too thin for their height.  WFP will use the contribution to procure rice for the national school meal programme to ensure children can continue receiving a significant portion of their daily energy and nutrition requirement through the free school meals, it said. It will also enable WFP to distribute ration packs comprising essential commodities to vulnerable households.   “Getting the right nutrition to those who need it the most will help mitigate the long-term effects of today’s economic downturn,” says Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, WFP Representative and Country Director in Sri Lanka. “WFP is grateful for Japan’s contribution at this critical hour. We thank Japan for its generosity and solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka. WFP will support the Sri Lankan Government with emergency food assistance based on assessments that identify the most pressing needs.”  (PA)"

The fall in tea earnings is due to two reasons. They are both the decline in tea export volumes as well as in prices, YoY in the review period. Tea export volumes in the first four months of the year decreased by 4.88 per cent (4.2 million kilos) YoY to 82 million kgs, while tea prices in the review period decreased by 9.24 per cent (US$ 0.45) to 4.42 per kg, Free on Board (FOB). Fall in tea export volumes was contributed by the fall in tea production. Tea production in the first four months of the year fell by 17.52 per cent (18.31 million kgs) YoY to 86.23 million kgs. The chief reason for the decline in tea production was President Nandasena Gotabaya Rajapaksa banning the import of chemical fertiliser, weedicides and fungicides for a seven-month period from April 2021 to November. This ban was subsequently rescinded, but too late to undo the damage caused. And the reason for the fall in tea prices, sanctions on Russia by the global community, one of Sri Lanka’s top tea importers, due to its invasion of Ukraine and sanctions also on Iran, due to its nuclear programme. However, sanctions on Iran are currently being phased out, if not being completely lifted, due to it falling in line to be accommodative of the international community’s concerns.  By Paneetha Ameresekere"

He also said the Leaders and Public representatives in Parliament are still planning on appointing people and that no steps have been taken to resolve the crises. “Every day, the prices of essential commodities rise. However, the daily wage of upcountry workers has not increased until today, and they are paid Rs 700. Unfortunately, upcountry people cannot afford Rs 300 for one kilogramme of wheat flour, and they cannot survive on such a low wage. A family requires approximately five Kilogramme of flour per day, which now costs Rs 1,500, which is double the wage earned from plantation work. Furthermore, the country’s fuel crisis has not been resolved, and people are still waiting in long lines. Our people in the upcountry are suffering even more than those in Colombo, and they can’t even afford milk powder for their children,” Suresh explained. Suresh went on to say that as representatives of the Tamil and upcountry communities, they are ashamed of the country’s current situation, and that if they cannot understand and fulfil the public’s requests, being in Parliament is pointless. “We obey the leaders but we do not trust them. They need to do something to resolve the problems of the people and prove them to make us trust them,” he said. By Eunice Ruth"

CMEV Co-Convener, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, said to hold an election, the country will have to bring about political reforms by abolishing the Executive Presidency and achieve economic stability. Dr. Saravanamuttu said the CMEV urges that the perpetrators of violence that occurred a few days ago at the GotaGoGama and MynaGoGama protest sites should be held accountable. Meanwhile, CMEV Head of Operations D.M. Dissanayake said though the Court has imposed travel bans on 17 individuals, the Police have not arrested anyone or taken any type of action against the perpetrators, and this is a threat to democracy. CMEV Coordinator A.M.N. Victor emphasised that the CMEV believes that violence can never be the solution and urges the protestors and the public to exercise restraint. He also urged the Security Forces to respect the fundamental rights of the public.  By Nabiya Vaffoor"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/05/14/sl-missions-in-talks-to-raise-us-3b/,SL Missions in talks to raise US$ 3B,Author not found,0,2022-05-13T20:30:00+00:00," Diplomatic missions of Sri Lanka are in talks to raise some US$ 3 billion from the respective countries over the next few months, Government sources said. “Sri Lanka needs a few more bridge financing options to close the funding gap until a programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) takes effect,” they said. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), it will take at least 3 to 6 months to finalise an IMF arrangement subject to local political conditions. Sri Lanka is, therefore, considering another US$ 1 billion swap facility with the Reserve Bank of India. In addition, talks are underway to obtain an additional US$ 500 million in short-term loan assistance from India for petroleum imports. Of the US$ 1 billion loan previously approved by India, Sri Lanka has so far drawn some US$ 300 million for the import of consumer goods. The rest will be used for other essential imports, including petroleum. In this connection, India has to complete several time-consuming regulatory processes for their petroleum products to reach Sri Lanka. In addition, the Government is looking at the possibility of unconditionally converting the Yuan-denominated US$ 1.5 billion swap facility currently available with China into a medium-term soft loan. In another concession, China has recently agreed to refinance its maturing US$ 1 billion loan, although tenor and rates are unknown. Sri Lanka, however, has so far declined the refinancing facility, as it has decided to restructure all of its foreign debt, including bilateral arrangements on the principle that all external debtors are treated equally. Sri Lanka has also applied for US$ 100 million in emergency funding through the Chinese-led Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), where Sri Lanka is also a participant. The Chinese Embassy in Colombo, however, says such financing could take at least six months to finalise. Thus, the Government is focusing on the possibility of obtaining this urgent funding requirement from the World Bank. Meanwhile, the two large local state commercial banks, People’s Bank and Bank of Ceylon, are said to be currently facing a severe dollar liquidity crisis.  Given the deteriorating situation, the issuance of foreign currency loans to local banks from external sources has come to a complete standstill. Such stress has been relieved to some extent by India and Bangladesh, who have agreed to postpone the settlement of all their swap transactions with Sri Lanka for about a year. In addition, the Indian-backed Asian Clearing Union (ACU) has also extended all quarterly settlements by Sri Lanka during 2022 until next year. Such financial stress cannot be alleviated altogether. As indicated by the CBSL Governor recently, the foreign reserves of Sri Lanka that can be used are at a negligible level at present. Market participants say CBSL is currently meeting the short-term foreign exchange payments requirements of the country from funds received via the ACU System and the local foreign exchange market on a daily basis. Inflows from exports and remittances currently amount to US$ 1.3-US$ 1.4 billion a month, of which some US$ 500-600 million is utilised to cover the import needs of exporters such as raw material, etc. In addition, the Government has committed to spend around US$ 400 million a month on petroleum imports, with another US$ 400 million attributed to LP Gas and medication. Thus, ignoring coupon and capital payments on foreign debt which seem to have been omitted from recent public discourse, the monthly deficit is running at around US$ 200 million a month, the primary reason for the stress. The timing of these flows is not entirely controllable, thus generating the secondary stress. With no reserves to cushion, even out, and spread these fluctuating flows, Sri Lanka remains subject to the resulting sway and hence continuous stress. At present, the Government is taking steps to import essential medicines and LP Gas using US$ 400 million agreed to by the World Bank as well as similar financing from India for petroleum and other essentials, but neither are sustainable solutions. Containment measures are required. By Ishara Gamage"

PUCSL’s Janaka Rathnayake said the thermal power plants, which use diesel and naphtha, have not been in operation in the last two to three days due to the lack of fuel. “At the moment, a crude oil vessel has arrived in Sri Lanka. However, the Government is yet to find the necessary funds to release the ship for the fuel,” he said. Speaking further, Rathnayake said that 45 per cent of electrical power over the last few days has been generated by hydropower plants. Commenting on Norochcholai power plant’s breakdown, Rathnayake said the plant is expected to be reconnected to the national grid by 22 May. He said that there is a possibility of power cuts being reduced as Sri Lanka is expected to receive more rain over the next few weeks."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/05/14/dollar-drops-to-rs-365/,Dollar drops to Rs 365,Author not found,0,2022-05-13T20:30:00+00:00," The benchmark market ‘spot’ in interbank foreign exchange (FX) trading sharply strengthened by between Rs 25-30 (6.94-7.59 per cent) to close Friday (13.5,22.) at Rs 360/365 to the US dollar in two-way quotes, market sources told Ceylon Today. On the previous day, Thursday, the ‘spot’ had closed stronger at Rs 385/395 to the dollar in two-way quotes. Friday’s strengthening of the ‘spot’ was due to Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe issuing a circular to the CEOs of all banks on Thursday, the day UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as Premier, requesting that the ‘spot’ be allowed to trade within a band of Rs 360 +/- Rs 2.60. Meanwhile, Friday’s strengthening of the ‘spot’ was only the third occasion that it has made gains after CBSL more than two months ago on 10 March allowed it to free float, having had previously administering the ‘spot’ at various levels. In related developments, the ‘spot’ since its free float on 10 March has fallen by between a record  Rs 130-135 (56.52-58.70 per cent) to Rs 360/365 to the dollar in two-way quotes and year on year (YoY) by between another record Rs 160.25-164.75 (80.22-802.7 per cent), thereby causing cost-push inflationary pressure as Sri Lanka is an import dependent economy. Meanwhile, on 9 March 2022, the day before the ‘spot’ was free floated, the ‘spot’ was administered by CBSL at Rs 230 to the dollar, while a year ago on 13 May 2021 it was administered at Rs 199.75/200.25 to the dollar in two way quotes by CBSL. In like developments, from 28 April 2021 to 9 March 2022, a unique thing happened in the country’s interbank FX market, where for the first time after the liberalisation of the economy that took place on 21 July 1977, the interbank FX market went virtually dead after CBSL started fixing the ‘spot’, void of hardly any CBSL intervention in the interbank FX market. However, the exchange rate was once more liberalized 11 months later on 10 March 2022.  ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of Government of Sri Lanka’s (GoSL’s) debt and of its foreign reserves, also deals in ‘spot’. In similar developments, the administered value of the ‘spot’ as at Friday was Rs 360, down by a record Rs 130.50 (56.86 per cent) since 9 March and, also, weaker YoY by another record Rs 80.45 (Rs 160.50). On 9 March CBSL administered the ‘spot’ at Rs 229.50 to the dollar and on 13 May 2021, at Rs 199.50 to the dollar. BY Paneetha Ameresekere"

In a letter to the IGP on Friday (13), the TUCC accused the Police Department of not arresting and charging any of the SLPP thugs or the conspirators, who planned the attack on GotaGoGama and MynaGoGama. “Sri Lankan Police are yet to arrest the conspirators and thugs, who planned and attacked, conspired to commit a crime, summoned thugs to Temple Trees as a result of the conspiracy, aided and abetted the thugs to inflict damage on life and property, when there was evidence that was more than adequate,” the TUCC charged. Expressing vehement disapproval of the attacks, the TUCC said there was clear proof that the perpetrators of the crimes were at Temple Trees. They include the former Premier, former Ministers Namal Rajapaksa, Johnston Fernando, Rohitha Abeygunawardana, Pavithra Wanniarachchi and Kanchana Jayaratne. Also, there is clear evidence to show that SDIG Tennakoon did nothing to control the provoked thugs who attacked the unarmed protesters. There is adequate evidence that the SDIG, being amongst the SLPP thugs, neglected the duties of his office by aiding and abetting them to injure the unarmed protesters and destroy their property, the Trade Union body charged.

Sirisena, detailing reasons for the decision, observed that the SLFP had proposed the establishment of an all-party government for the past three months and although several rounds of discussions were also held with Rajapaksa in this regard, the appointment of Wickremesinghe will result in the failure to form an all-party government. He added the proposal was for the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, under the all-party Government, to be appointed by a National Council represented by MPs of all parties.

Director NBTS, Dr. Lakshman Edirisinghe on Friday (6), lamented that the shortage in Triple Blood Bags (TBB) is contributing to the depletion of Double and Quadruple Blood Bags (QBB). TBB are designed to separate whole blood into three blood components: red blood cells, platelets and plasma. QBB are designed to collect whole blood to be separated into four different components which are red blood cells, plasma platelets and cryoprecipitate or leukocytes. These are mainly used in blood transfusions for cancer and thalassemia patients. The stocks being used at present are also from Europe, Japan and Singapore. “We may not be able to even purchase stocks with the Indian Credit line,” he observed. The NBTS chief said that with the shortage of TBB, the NBTS had been forced to reach out for its stocks of Double and QBB causing further shortage. The NBTS has appealed for donations as it would help thousands of lives. The QBB is an imported item and cannot be purchased from just anywhere. Sri Lanka’s blood transfusion service has earned recognition and the transfusion bags meet the recognition of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Europe. Dr. Edirisinghe said however that he is hopeful of receiving about 45,000 blood bags by the end of next week and a stock of TBB by the end of May or early June. The State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC) is also working towards replenishing its supply of blood bags, the NBTS chief added. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Siyambalapitiya was elected as Deputy Speaker on Thursday (5) following a secret ballot held in Parliament by polling 148 votes, which is a majority of 83 votes against his opponent Imthiaz Bakeer Markar, who managed to poll 65 votes in total. In the resignation letter to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, he said the main reason behind his decision was the bad public image caused by the resignation drama. “The SLPP’s stance to support me in the secret ballot has caused the people to see me as their enemy. I resigned from the post earlier to support the struggle of the people. But now the people see me as an enemy after the SLPP’s public announcement that they support me,” he said. “As a politician who is always on the side of the ordinary people, I am deeply saddened by this situation. I cannot bear the pain caused by this,” he added. Siyambalapitiya first resigned from the post in early April after the SLFP decided to be independent in Parliament. However, as the President did not accept the resignation, he remained in the post until 30 April. The President accepted the resignation on 3 May.  By Methmalie Dissanayake"

In a statement, the SLNSS expressed its disgust over parliamentarians intentionally avoiding their duties and responsibilities while a national crisis is gripping the public. “The parliamentarians keep avoiding their duties and responsibilities while depending on people’s tax money. They even enjoy special privileges while the people are suffering day and night in long queues. We strongly condemn this disgusting conduct by parliamentarians,” the union said. “All political parties must take responsibility for the current national and economic crisis in Sri Lanka. However, even in this particular national crisis, the politicians have failed to pull their act together and come up with possible solutions. The proposals, especially about forming an interim government, presented by the majority of the people, civil society organisations and religious leaders have been completely ignored by Sri Lanka’s Parliament. They have miserably failed to work together despite their party differences during a national crisis,” they stressed. Therefore, the SLNSS says it will engage in trade union action by withdrawing all services at VIP terminals at all airports for Ministers and Parliamentarians. “The trade union action will be in effect until an all-party government is established and the current crises are resolved”.  By Methmalie Dissanayake"

Several protests were also launched in a number of areas. Railway trade unions and private bus owners withdrew from services at midnight on 5 May in support of the hartal. More than 2,000 trade unions and civil society organisations, including hundreds of unions in the health, transportation, railways, electricity, and education sectors, expressed support for the hartal. Many trade unions supported this hartal seeking a prompt political solution to the on-going crisis, and a permanent solution to the continuous fuel and essentials shortage. Several trade unions, including health, transportation, railways, electricity, and education sectors, decided to join the trade union action in solidarity with the nationwide hartal on 6 May. Ceylon Today visited several protests and several locations around Colombo, where the national hartal was being observed. The first stop of Ceylon Today was the Borella bus halt, where the Trade Unions Coordination Centre (TUCC) along 17 other trade unions, held a protest. The TUCC said that if the hartal on 6 May and the island-wide joint strike do not bear fruit, a continuous strike and continuous hartal will be launched on 11 May until the Government goes home. Even Central Bank officials stepped out and supported the hartal. While wandering along the Borella-Maradana route, a few private bus drivers, who have parked their buses on a side, claimed that most strikes are conducted in order to achieve narrow political gain. They said that they would function as usual if they had diesel. It’s due to the diesel shortage that they have been unable to function. The routes around the Borella, Maradana and Dematagoda areas were deserted like on a Sunday morning. These are locations, which are usually filled with people and busiest shops, were deserted though it was a Friday afternoon. Then, Ceylon Today headed towards the Bastian Place bus halt, where many private and public sector inter-provincial buses function. It looked deserted but few locals were seen playing cricket. When inquired, one of the players, who introduced himself as a worker in a nearby stall, noted that though they do not want to support the hartal but had to close their shops as the people who usually passby were not to be seen. Another individual introduced himself as a vendor who sells refreshments on the buses. He noted that they had no choice but to stop working. If the buses are functioning as usual he would definitely take his bucket of goods and get onto a bus to make an extra rupee. While heading back from Bastian Place bus halt we also found an interesting stall in front of Saunders Place, the locals served the ‘funeral meal’ in memory of the dead government and the President. The Fort Bridge, in front of the Fort railway station, which usually sees a lot of foot traffic, was deserted. When Ceylon Today reached the Fort railway station, it had many passengers waiting for the delayed trains unsure whether they were cancelled or not. The station master’s room was also locked and only three officials were at the station to direct the passengers. Ceylon Today also visited few protests led by the locals around the Kotikawatta junction and Kolonnawa junction, protestors noted that the locals have also held some protests around IDH road and Mulleriya Hospital. Pettah Market, Keyzer Street, Malwatta Road and the Cross streets which are always hectic and filled with vendors and people, had only few pigeons, many crows and beggars wandering by. The workers who claimed that they were continuing to clear their stocks and clean their stores like on a normal day, said there is no use of supporting such political activities because none of it benefits them or directly  or indirectly. Meanwhile, People staged a protest in front of the Balangoda Main Post Office to coincide with the islandwide hartal. The hartal movement was also supported by the Kegalle and Nuwara Eliya District by closing all shops. Employees of 57 factories in the Biyagama Free Trade Zone staged a protest blocking all three main entrances. These protests that Ceylon Today saw during the hartal had a significant number of children participating as well. When Ceylon Today asked one child why he is protesting, he noted that his parents used to give him Rs 20 to buy a match box, he buys it for Rs 10 and spends the rest on sweets, but now when they give Rs 50 there is only Rs 5 left to buy some sweets. Isn’t that why we are all fighting? Hartal at BIA With the commencement of the active Hartal on 6 May, by the employees of the Katunayake Airport, all the employees engaged in the daily duties of the Airport were given leave and discharged from the Airport. In support of the Hartal, the employees of the Katunayake Airport Inter Company Employees Union and the National Employees Union organised a protest campaign at noon on Friday. The duty manager of the Katunayake Airport said that although the employees, who were engaged in daily duties at the airport, had left on leave on 6 May, the airport was operating normally and without any interruption to air operations. A series of protest rallies were organised in Dambulla, Galewela, Naula, Sigiriya, etc. on the 6th, with shops putting up shutters and hoisting black flags in support of the hartal campaign. Workers in private factories in the Dambulla Oya area of Dambulla, dressed in black and carrying black flags, marched about six kilometres along one of the nine main roads to Dambulla town in protest. Another protest rally started by the Dambulla town volunteers, at the Gammudawa playground, blocked one side of the main road and marched towards the town and the economic centre in front of the Dambulla clock tower. Hospitals also join Employees of the Dambulla Base Hospital and several Government institutions also joined the protest in the afternoon. Lawyers working in the Dambulla Magistrate’s Court also marched to Dambulla town, near the Court premises after 12 noon and joined the protest. Shops were closed in Jaffna in support of the hartal. Citizens in Pelmadulla also participated in hartal. The business community in Moneragala and Buttala also joined the hartal demanding the President to step down. Shops closed and black flags were hoisted. In Akuressa a protest was launched in front of the main bus stand while all shops were closed and private busses and three-wheelers withdrew from service. Public in Dickwella also launched a protest followed by a march calling for the President and the Government to step down. A group of people also hoisted black flags in front of the bus stand in Elpitiya. Underwear Protest In a unique protest, male and female undergarments were hung on Police barricades set up near the Parliament (Polduwa Junction). The protesters hung undergarments with various anti-government slogans written on them, demanding the President to step down immediately, on Friday (6) morning. Meanwhile, Police fired tear gas and water cannons on protesters gathered at parliament entry roads on Friday evening. A massive crowed including the members of the Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF) established a new agitation site called ‘Horu Go Gama’. This was after the Police tried to disperse the IUSF members who protested at Parliament entry road at Polduwa Junction on Thursday (5). A massive crowd, who are agitated by the lukewarm conduct of both the Government and Parliament amid increasing burdens on the public, gathered in the area raising their displeasure of the country’s leaders, demanding the Government to resign immediately. Even after the water cannon and tear gas attack, protesters firmly stood their ground and blocked all the entry roads to Parliament. As a result, the MPs could not leave the Parliament premises for few hours after the adjournment of the sitting. SJB MPs surround Speaker’s office Meanwhile, a group of SJB MPs stormed the Speaker’s office in Parliament and questioned Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena on the Police attack on the protesters. They also questioned the Speaker on the delay in providing a date to debate the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) submitted against the Government. Serjeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando said all the MPs left Parliament premises safely using alternative roads. Since the House was adjourned until 17 May, the protesters announced they would leave the site until then. “We will come back again on 17 May. The MPs have 11 days to make a decision,” IUSF Convener Wasantha Mudalige said.

The meeting headed by MP Lasantha Alagiyawanna, examined the Auditor General’s reports for 2018, 2019 and 2020 and performance of the Ministry of Energy. According to COPA’s findings in 2016, the Chief Accounting Officer mentioned there are about five billion barrels of crude oil and about five trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Mannar Basin, which is enough to meet demand for about 60 years. The official added that the aforesaid deposits could be used to increase the country’s power supply to 1130 KW and the natural gas production would bring approximately USD 200 billion to the country in various sectors within a span of 25 years. However, COPA questioned officials on their failure to explore this area and plan out a proper procedure to generate revenue for the country from various sectors by commercially producing gas from the two identified deposits. Officials said it was difficult to find a reliable investor for the project and added that the number of employees of the SLPDA is not enough to deal with this matter. Furthermore, the modernisation and expansion of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery and the construction of a new refinery were also discussed at the meeting. According to the officials, a feasibility study has been carried out to set up a new oil refinery at Sapugaskanda. COPA recommended that a report be submitted in this regard. Furthermore, vacancies in the staff and the daily oil requirement of the country were also discussed. State Minister B.Y.G. Rathnasekara and MPs Duminda Dissanayake, Tissa Attanayake, Ashok Abeysinghe, Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle and Cader Mastan were present at the meeting. By Gagani Weerakoon and Methmalie Dissanayake"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/05/07/female-farmers-make-less-use-of-agri-inputs-than-male-counterpart-wb-study/,Female farmers make less use of agri inputs than male counterpart – WB Study,Author not found,0,2022-05-06T20:30:00+00:00," Studies have shown that female farmers make less use of agricultural inputs (Rs 2,923/month) than male farmers (Rs 5,449/month), the World Bank (WB) in a publication titled ‘Exploring the Sources of the Agricultural Productivity Gender Gap Evidence from Sri Lanka’ said. But, they are also less likely to receive subsidies (18 per cent) than male farmers (38.9 per cent) and conditional on receipt, the amount received by women (Rs 658/month) is smaller than for male farmers (Rs 935/month), it said. Nonetheless, Sri Lanka’s land laws may discriminate against women who opt to be governed by personal laws, the WB said. Women who marry under the Thesawalami law cannot gain control of property without their husband’s consent, it said. Also, under the Land Development Ordinance of 1935 and its subsequent amendments, the grant of state land in agricultural settlement schemes continues to favour men over women because grants are generally made to the male head of the household, it further said. Further disadvantages include lower access to finance (proxied by whether the farmer had a loan); less access to paid agricultural family labour and a lower degree of mechanization (proxied by tractor ownership), the WB said. Female farmers also have fewer opportunities for nonfarm activities relative to male farmers: while 44.9 per cent of male farmers are engaged in nonfarm labour activities and drew 29.7 per cent of their income from these sources, only 19.3 per cent of female farmers have access to nonfarm labour opportunities which comprise only 10.3 per cent of their income, the WB said. “Meanwhile, women working in agriculture spend significantly less time on paid employment and more time on unpaid domestic work, whether compared to male workers in agriculture or to their counterparts working outside agriculture,” the WB said. Thus, interventions that could ease women’s household responsibilities for instance are likely to help increase women’s agricultural productivity and generate more crop income, it said. However, agriculture productivity measured by yields, defined as output value per acre, is higher among female farmers than male farmers, the WB recently said.  “The average value of crop output per acre is higher for female farmers (Rs 19,809/acre) than male farmers (Rs 15,976/acre), resulting in a productivity advantage for female farmers.” They attributed this to two reasons. They are that female farmers generally grow export-oriented crops like tea, whereas male farmers tend to grow low -value crops like paddy catering to the domestic market and the relatively smaller size of female farmer plots compared to those of males. Among male farmers, about 45 per cent of land was accounted for by paddy, which is more than twice as much as the share among female farmers (20 per cent), the WB said. In addition, the crop mix of female farmers tends to skew toward export-oriented crops: for example, an average of 31 per cent of land area was dedicated to tea cultivation among female farmers whereas the share was only 14 per cent for male farmers, it said. Meanwhile, the average land area cultivated by female farmers (1.04 acres) is only about half of that of male farmers (1.95 acres), the WB said. “We find that the leading contributor to this productivity gap in favour of women is the smaller size of the plots that women cultivate, reflecting the inverse relationship between farm size and agricultural productivity,” it said. “However, this female productivity advantage does not translate into higher incomes among female farmers as smaller plots are associated with lower crop income,” the WB warned. Thus, policies designed to promote equitable land rights for women and men could help address this gap, it said. But on the whole, improving productivity of paddy can contribute to food security while releasing land and labour for the cultivation of higher-value crops, within agro-climatic constraints, the WB said. However, the Sri Lankan Government’s import substitution strategy which favours import competing commodities such as paddy, along with a fertiliser subsidy programme mainly focused on paddy cultivation is likely to discourage a shift toward high-value agriculture, the WB warned.

The original architects of the Altair Project, Design Team 3 (Private) Limited of Singapore and its Chief Executive Officer Architect Athula Amarasekera filed the Writ Application before the Court of Appeal seeking to obtain a writ of prohibition against the UDA from accepting and/or acting upon a purported certificate submitted by a Chartered Architect, other than the Petitioners for the purpose of issuing the Certificate of Conformity (‘CoC’) in respect of the said Project. However, after filing this application, the CoC was issued by the UDA and the Court temporarily suspended the said CoC until Court looks in to the questions involved in the application. The Court on Friday observed that the Petitioners and the Developer who was named as a respondent is clearly contractual and/or in commercial nature which prevents the Petitioners to seek any relief in an application for judicial review only by making the public authorities such as UDA a party. “I am of the view that filing a judicial review application against the State parties, including the UDA, in order to resolve a dispute arising out of a contract between the first  Petitioner and the Developer is unreasonable,” Justice Sobhitha Rajakaruna observed in the Judgment. The Court also awarded a sum of Rs 500,000  to be paid by the Petitioners (jointly and severally) to the UDA and a sum of Rs 250,000.00 to be paid by the Petitioners (jointly and severally) to the Secretary Ministry of Urban Development and Housing. The application of the Petitioner for the withdrawal of the instant application was also allowed subject to the payment of the above costs awarded by the Court.

He also ordered the Police to make submissions to him promptly. The Judge ordered the second accused, to lodge a complaint with any Police Station that he deems fit and for that relevant Police Station to investigate the complaint before making submissions to the High Court. The Judge gave this order, when the hit-and-run case, against the former Minister and two others, over the causing of grievous injury to youth Sandeep Sampath at Rajagiriya in 2016, during a traffic accident, was taken up for hearing. President’s Counsel Maithri Guneratne, told Court that second accused Dilum Thusitha Kumara, who had posed as the driver of the vehicle involved in the accident, implicating first accused Patali Ranawaka, had received two phone calls on Thursday. He said that his client, second accused Kumara, had received the two phone calls from the CCD and from an officer identified as Neville Silva. Counsel Guneratne stated that via the two calls, his client had been warned not to change his stance and they had also warned that if he were to do so, he should be prepared to face the consequences. He then urged Court, to issue a suitable order with regard to the measures that his client should undertake in this connection. DSG Dileepa Peiris, prosecuting, stated that the probe into the case has already been concluded by the investigative officers and the case abstracts had been sent for the perusal of the Attorney General. He said that the Attorney General had then filed the case before the High Court and maintained that there was no pressure being exerted by investigative officers. He charged that the allegations made by the defence, were baseless and noted that they were made with the intention of eroding the implicit trust and confidence, placed on investigative institutions by the Judiciary. The DSG added that the defence had failed to clearly submit any information with regard to the identity of the investigative officers, who had threatened the second accused and observed that details have to be furnished properly, if a coordinated probe is to be conducted. Taking the submissions into consideration, Judge Thotawatta stated that the trial proceedings will be kicked off, after reading out the charges filed against the accused and upon them pleading not guilty to the charges filed against them. He mentioned that during the course of the trial, even if the accused were to change their original stance, such actions will not be disadvantageous to the prosecution. The three accused, namely Ranawaka, Kumara and former OIC of the Welikada Police ASP Sudath Asmadala, who have been indicted on 16 counts, were present in Court yesterday. Accordingly, the Court fixed further trial proceedings for 9 May and advised the second witness to the prosecution Siddiq Mohammad Suhai, to be present in Court on that date.

Briefing the media, at the Government Information Department, on Friday (6), Minister Prof. Jayasumana said that at present there was a shortage of well-known syrup brands which are prescribed for children. Should the brand name that is unavailable be written, the patient or the relatives of the patient assume that the drug itself is unavailable at the pharmacy. However, if the generic name of the particular drug is written the patient would be able to obtain the drug according to his or her prescription. He noted that the National Regulatory Authority Act would be amended in this regard in the near future. “But this is not the time to be carrying out amendments to Parliamentary Acts. Therefore, I appeal to medical practitioners to use the drug generic in their prescriptions,” he said. Prof. Jayasumana said the country had been received 106 drug types from 1 April 2022 till date through the letters of credit which had been opened. It takes at least 90 days, even if they start manufacturing the drug after Sri Lanka is able to open the letters credit. Citing an example, he said the Health Ministry had been able to procure ‘Tenecteplase’ a patented drug prescribed for heart patients, two weeks after opening LCs. Also, the Ministry would be able to procure the Anti Rabies Serum which is in short supply within the next 20 days, he reassured.           By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Current inflationary pressure is caused by money printing, high international prices and the lack of US dollars in the domestic market. In related developments, overall inflation also accelerated for the seventh consecutive month, with the immediately preceding month, March 2022, throwing up an overall inflationary figure of 18.7 per cent. Overall inflation has been in double digits for the five consecutive months to April.

Accordingly, by abolishing the executive presidential system, we need to implement a Council of State where we can let trade unions, youth and women take part in the country’s political system, except for the 225 members.

SLCAT said the Police officials are alleged to have used violence, including beating with batons and firing live ammunition repeatedly at people fleeing. “The results of the investigation to be made public to ensure transparency and accountability and the Government to immediately apologise to the victims and their families and take responsibility for the direct and wider harms caused to its citizens,” their official statement said. They also demanded that the Government and the IGP to immediately pledge to ensure the safety and security of the families of victims and guarantee that they are not subject to reprisals for seeking accountability or providing information to the investigation. They also urged that the families of victims be provided compensation. “These actions are alleged to have caused grave injuries to civilians agitating against government actions particularly the hike in fuel prices. Reports have been received of at least one confirmed death and over 12 citizens injured with two in critical condition as a result of violence by the Police. Police brutality is systemic and widespread and has become a normalised part of the maintenance of law and order in the country. SLCAT has continuously urged decision makers to address the structural nature of this problem and to respond expeditiously and meaningfully to victims of such violence,” they said.  “The Government of Sri Lanka, including all officers and hierarchy of the Police, are bound to adhere to the Constitution of Sri Lanka that recognises the right of any person in Sri Lanka to be free from torture as an absolute fundamental right (Article 11). Further, the Convention against Torture Act 1994, enacted to fulfill Sri Lanka’s international obligations as a party to the UN Convention against Torture, criminalizes torture. The Sri Lankan Constitution also prohibits any citizen from being punished with death or imprisonment except by order of a competent court (Article 13(4). Despite pledges by successive governments to address the systemic nature of torture there has been hardly any substantive change to the practices of the police. This is directly linked to the failure to hold those who use violence accountable. For instance, the use of live ammunition seemingly as a first response, rather than the use of de-escalation techniques and non-violent means to diffuse tension, and the description by authorities of such action as ‘minimum force’ demonstrates that the use of violence has become normalised. The Police response that the individual who was killed had cases against him also attempts to justify and normalise violence against persons perceived as suspected criminals. Governments have also failed to demonstrate the political will necessary to acknowledge and engage in urgent institutional reform,” they added. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/04/17/jvp-slams-pms-address/,JVP slams PM’s address,By Aloka Kasturiarachchi,0,2022-04-17T10:31:00+00:00,"Propaganda Secretary of the JVP Vijitha Herath said Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s address to the nation on 11 April showed no solutions to the crises in the country. He said despite the fact that Rajapaksa claimed to have 60 years of political experience he had demoted himself to the level of a Pradeshiya Sabha member because of his sluggish speech.  Addressing the Media, Herath said hundreds of people wanted to hear a  solution to the serious economic and political crises in the Prime Minister’s address to the nation on 11 April. “The entire country saw his immaturity. Despite torrential rains, the youth are agitating day and night to relieve the pressure in their hearts. The Prime Minister hasn’t picked up on their heartbeat. The Prime Minister has no idea what Sri Lankans all over the world are saying with one voice,” Herath said. He alleged that either the Prime Minister has lost his senses with age or they are deliberately trying to push the issue elsewhere.  “The Prime Minister’s speech was about war, Covid-19, and the ‘88-89 era”.  Herath said it has now been 13 years since the end of the war. “The people hoped that the country would be economically stronger after the war. This was stated by the leaders. However, 13 years after the end of the war, there are issues that did not even exist during the war.  People had a littale bit of hope in Mahinda Rajapaksa after Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s downfall. That has been shattered by his address last night. What the Prime Minister did was cover up the real issue and make an indirect threat to save his younger brother; the President. They are trying to cover up the issue by making various allegations. We reiterate to the Government not to continue that game,” he further said. “As a Prime Minister who has been in politics for 60 years, we cannot allow these issues to escape,” Herath said. “We are with the people. The only way out of this economic and political crisis is to create a people’s government. The economic crisis cannot be resolved without an answer to the political crisis. We will bring back the collapsed country. We invite the people to intervene. Let us overthrow corrupt family rule and build a people’s government. We urge the people to be prepared for that,” he added."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/04/17/namal-kumara-not-investigated-ajith-rohana-2/,Namal Kumara not investigated – Ajith Rohana,By Faadhila Thassim,0,2022-04-17T10:22:00+00:00,"The conduct of Namal Kumara who according to Opposition MPs and civil society activists, allegedly disrupted former Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) Director, Nalaka de Silva from arresting Easter Sunday Attacks suicide bomber Zaharan Hashim, has not been investigated, as there is insufficient information to prove a connection between his conduct and the Easter Sunday attacks, Senior DIG Ajith Rohana said. Kumara exposed an alleged plan to assassinate former President Maithripala Sirisena and present President Gotabaya Rajapaksa prior to the Easter Sunday attacks, leading to the arrest of Silva, who had then obtained a warrant to arrest Zaharan.  Previously, participating in a parliamentary debate on the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into Easter Sunday Attacks, SJB MP Ranjith Maddumabandara said Silva’s arrest disrupted the investigation against Zaharan, while he said, “That was merely a drama. Now where is Namal Kumara? Why hasn’t an investigation commenced on his conduct? Most importantly, what happened to his allegations?” Speaking at a Media briefing held with regard to the progress of the investigations into the Easter Sunday Attacks on 12 Tuesday, Rohana said there is insufficient information to prove a connection between Kumara and the investigations conducted into the Easter Sunday Attacks. Referring to the statement made by Kumara of the alleged plan to assassinate the former President and present President, Rohana said while such statement was investigated, this did not in any manner connect to the investigations conducted into the Easter Sunday Attacks. He added that the TID and the CID conducted investigations into the activities of Hashim before the Easter Sunday Attacks, which showed that the Batticaloa Police in 2018 issued an arrest warrant against Zaharan, while reiterating however that this was immaterial to the investigations in relation to the attacks."
