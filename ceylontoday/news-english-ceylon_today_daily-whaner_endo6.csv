Association Secretary of the association Rohana Perera said reducing the Octane 92 price by seven rupees per litre would not affect taxi fares. “A three-wheeler runs 25 km per litre. With this seven-rupee revision, the cost of a kilometre will be 28 cents. Therefore, the petrol price revision cannot be used to make a fare revision at this time. It is true that the cost of living is decreasing and the prices of three-wheeler spare parts and oil have also come down,” he added. Perera claimed that they are still getting eight litres of petrol in the weekly quota and on the remaining days the drivers have to get fuel through various illegal methods. “We are facing a critical situation when getting petrol,” he said. Therefore, it is not possible to reduce the three-wheeler fares at this time, Perera said.  He also advised his fellow drivers to get registered with the Western Provincial Council and the Ministry of Power and Energy, so they get 15 litres of diesel per week, legally.

The commemoration of 131st death anniversary of James Taylor is therefore of a great significance to the plantation industry. Even after 131 years there are many lessons to be learnt from the life and deeds of this pioneer tea planter not only for planters but for all professed entrepreneurs. In the colossal and economically crucial period of time, for the tea industry, which we see today, I hope this message will give those who are associated with tea industry an insight of James Taylor’s dedication to his assignment and will remind us that it is up us to improve and consolidate the tea industry established over 155 years ago, as an industrial beacon to be reckoned with among, tea producing countries. It is therefore, not only a duty but an obligation on our part as the beneficiaries of Taylor to remember this great pioneer at least when his 131st death anniversary is commemorated. According to the record of burials available at Mahaiyawa Cemetery, Kandy, James Taylor of Loolecondera Estate, Ceylon the pioneer of the tea and Cinchona Enterprises in this Island, died on 2 May 1892 at the age of 57 years. All concerned with the wellbeing of the industry, hope and pray that the management companies will show the intrepidness and foresight of the Founding Father in managing the estates, which is under their purview ensure the stability and growth of the industry. In this account of the late James Taylor, I may have omitted other important factors in relation to this great man but the fact remains that as a Nation we should be grateful to the pioneer who brought the great tea industry to Ceylon on a commercial basis and we largely depend on this for employment and foreign exchange to the present day. We pray that he may be rewarded suitably in his place of rest.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

GMOF President Dr. Rukshan Bellana yesterday (1) urged the government to ensure that the freedom given to University dons to cause an upheaval in the lives of students who had sat their A/L s and those who are to sit the GCE Ordinary Level Examination and their parents with their behavior is curbed. “These parents have suffered with their children for the past 13 years spending colossal sums of money on their education only to have University teachers with vested interests holding their entire future to ransom,” he lashed out. These lecturers have not learnt to correct GCE A/L papers overnight but have gone through workshops conducted to specially train them on A/L paper marking and have not been endowed with the capability with their doctorates. He urged the government to have those workshops for doctors as they were prepared to take up the task and put the innocent children and their parents out of the agony of having their lives disrupted and delayed from moving ahead. There are 25,000 doctors who have obtained best A/L results. Of them at least 500 to 600 had their masters in ‘information technology (IT),’ another 700 or so have qualified in ‘management’, another 700 have qualified in ‘law’ while another 700 or more have doctorates in Health Economics and there are another 2,500 who have doctorates in their own field. He observed that there were another 1,000 non specialists who also had the proficiency in languages and Arts subjects. “Unfortunately, the university academics tasked with the duty have taken on more of a political agenda, like they did in 2014, when they resorted to a similar campaign demanding a six per cent budgetary allocation for education in order to bring former President Maithripala Sirisena to power. However, they seemed to have forgotten this demand after the election. Once more they are on a mission. Therefore, something should be done about replacing them,” the GMOF President said. “A country like Russia, Cuba or even China would not have tolerated such acts of sabotage, where persons engaged in them would have been executed. In countries like China and North Korea such behavior, which infringes on the freedom of others would be a punishable offence. We have seen how corruption has been dealt with in those countries,” the GMOF President said adding that being a democratic country, Sri Lanka was far more tolerant. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The downward trend started in 2022, when revenue dropped by almost 20% from USD 1.2 billion in 2021 to USD 1 billion by the end of the year. Due to the sharp decline in both domestic and international demand, many factories have reduced production capacity or are temporarily closing. The forward order books have also decreased significantly. Although input costs have decreased as well, buyers continue to request price cuts in order to place new orders, according to SLAMERP Director General Rohan Masakorala. He added that while the US experienced a stagnant first quarter of 2023, Europe had a sharp decline in orders. On the global front, the demand is coming down due to high inventory with buyers and also the recessionary pressures linked to inflation and interest rate hikes which are affecting the total global supply chain.  SLAMERP also expressed concern that the only positive factor they had was the global freight which peaked in the last two years, was coming down due to market forces, but locally the shipping ministry has taken decisions to artificially inflate freight rates by allowing un-bundling of the freight, to avoid market forces, by removing a competition gazette that was originally introduced in 2013. SLAMERP said that they are confident that President Ranil Wickremesinghe, whom they have spoken to, will fix this issue. The industry also said that the government must focus on supporting the export industry to grow, encourage new export diversification and ensure that the national export strategy is implemented along with the rubber master plan, which had been neglected. The country’s economic problems have to be resolved by strengthening the export sector with every possible support extended by all line ministries, the Director General emphasised. (SRM)"

If he doesn’t come here and apologise to the people who expected him, I won’t be a part of the SJB,” he stressed. Furthermore, he said there is constant discussion about a national policy, and that in such discussions, the upcountry plantation sector should not be left out because they are also citizens of Sri Lanka. Also, if a national plan is formed, they should be included without any discrimination, he insisted adding that the plantation workers also deserve all the rights enjoyed by Sri Lankans. “Our people are not terrorists or those involved in terrorist activities. They have not been involved in any violence in the country. Why should those who have worked to make the country a better place, be overlooked? They are still landless. Our people have no food to eat and no safe place to live. When people are suffering like this, the party and its symbol are irrelevant to me,” he stated. He also stated that during the economic current crisis, each worker in the plantation sector should be paid at least Rs 3,250 per day. “This is assessed by University of Peradeniya.

The Dialogue was held in the backdrop of the Indian Ocean – The Ocean of the 21st Century’s significant big power contestations and focused on how small, island, and littoral states in South Asia can position themselves as hubs for cooperation in several areas, such maritime infrastructure, dealing with maritime disasters, climate resilience, and economy and trade. A panel discussion chaired by Ambassador Pamela Jayasekera Deen featured the President of BIPSS Major General Muniruzzaman, Rear Admiral (Retd) Y. N. Jayarathna and Co-Founder of The Baani Centre Thoriq Hamid. ‘’The biggest problem for South Asia is the absence of maritime security architecture for the region,” noted Major General Muniruzzaman of BIPSS. ‘’The Indian Ocean region is a center of gravity in international politics. 70% of energy resources and 80% of global oil supplies are transported through the Indian Ocean,’’ he added.  There is a need to build capacity around marine spatial planning, observed former Chief Hydrographer Rear Admiral (Retd) Y.N. Jayarathna. ‘’Maritime security infrastructure and surveillance must be improved,’’ he explained, noting that ‘’in the last five years maritime tracking systems have improved significantly in Sri Lanka.’’ ‘’Potential oil spills, illegal fishing, narcotics trafficking, and terrorism are key concerns for the Maldives,’’ noted Thoriq Hamid. ‘’Climate threats for a country like the Maldives, which is home to 99% ocean and 1% land, is something we cannot afford not to worry about,’’ he added.

Addressing a May Day rally in the upcountry, Suresh said he was cautioning SJB Leader Premadasa to not take the people of the upcountry for granted. “He skipped the meeting in Madulsima recently. If he doesn’t come here and apologise to the people who expected him, I won’t be a part of the SJB,” he stressed. Furthermore, he said there is constant discussion about a national policy, and that in such discussions, the upcountry plantation sector should not be left out because they are also citizens of Sri Lanka. Also, if a national plan is formed, they should be included without any discrimination, he insisted adding that the plantation workers also deserve all the rights enjoyed by Sri Lankans. “Our people are not terrorists or those involved in terrorist activities. They have not been involved in any violence in the country. Why should those who have worked to make the country a better place, be overlooked? They are still landless. Our people have no food to eat and no safe place to live. When people are suffering like this, the party and its symbol are irrelevant to me,” he stated. He also stated that during the economic current crisis, each worker in the plantation sector should be paid at least Rs 3,250 per day. “This is assessed by University of Peradeniya. The President of the country should ensure that all regional Plantation companies pay that sum,” he said. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Dialogue was held in the backdrop of the Indian Ocean – The Ocean of the 21st Century’s significant big power contestations and focused on how small, island, and littoral states in South Asia can position themselves as hubs for cooperation in several areas, such maritime infrastructure, dealing with maritime disasters, climate resilience, and economy and trade. A panel discussion chaired by Ambassador Pamela Jayasekera Deen featured the President of BIPSS Major General Muniruzzaman, Rear Admiral (Retd) Y. N. Jayarathna and Co-Founder of The Baani Centre Thoriq Hamid. ‘’The biggest problem for South Asia is the absence of maritime security architecture for the region,” noted Major General Muniruzzaman of BIPSS. ‘’The Indian Ocean region is a center of gravity in international politics. 70% of energy resources and 80% of global oil supplies are transported through the Indian Ocean,’’ he added.  There is a need to build capacity around marine spatial planning, observed former Chief Hydrographer Rear Admiral (Retd) Y.N. Jayarathna. ‘’Maritime security infrastructure and surveillance must be improved,’’ he explained, noting that ‘’in the last five years maritime tracking systems have improved significantly in Sri Lanka.’’ ‘’Potential oil spills, illegal fishing, narcotics trafficking, and terrorism are key concerns for the Maldives,’’ noted Thoriq Hamid. ‘’Climate threats for a country like the Maldives, which is home to 99% ocean and 1% land, is something we cannot afford not to worry about,’’ he added. The Dialogue which resulted in a 6-point Declaration was attended by defence officials, diplomats, foreign policy analysts, academics, civil society, and youth, who urged transforming the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace and denuclearisation. Factum, BIPSS, and Baani also signed a Trilateral Memorandum of Understanding to sustain thematic cooperation and pursue measures of mutual benefit for the Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and the Maldives.

About 62 per cent of total patients are aged 18-55, Dissanayake said. Speaking further, he said the Health Ministry is more focused on destroying mosquito breeding grounds and has overlooked fogging.

The President instructed officials to develop a system to track AI contributions and stressed the importance of taking prompt action to increase AI contribution to the Gross Domestic Product in the coming years.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Government should step in and assist those already involved in combating this menace, said former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. She was speaking at the launch of ‘Chronicles of Melancholy’ true life stories of child abuse survivors, organised by Stop Child Cruelty Trust (SCC) and Child Protection Alliance recently. She alleged that responsible State institutions were not responding during some cases of child abuse and shared a firsthand experience where the relevant authorities had been very indolent. “I even made personal requests to the authorities requesting action to be taken  regarding the issue, but they did not accede to the request. Even a former President of the country cannot get support in a case of child abuse to save ordinary people. The Government should look into these issues and ensure the efficiency of these institutions,” she said. On a further note, she claimed that women are also victimised in society and  records of abuse and harassment on women have escalated during recent times. “Our society has become a very unsafe place for women. Numerous friends and relatives who visit Sri Lanka from foreign lands, claim our public transportation to be unsafe. They are intimidated by the behaviour of Sri Lankan men. Not only foreigners, evena local woman can’t travel alone these days. And domestic violence is on a high.” The former President expressed her displeasure over the way the Police were dealing with cases of sexual abuse. “Women are unsure of seeking help from the Police, because most Police Officers would end up embarrassing the victim  and sometimes even try to put the blame on the woman’s dress or find something else to blame it on” “There are several individuals and organisations like SCC and Child Protection Alliance that work against child and women abuse, and I personally work with most of them. I am ready to give any support to them in the future as well. But all our work is just a small drop in the ocean. We can’t progress further, unless the Government gives its fullest support,” she said. By Induwara Athapattu"

The neo-liberal capitalist social economic system that dominated the world for forty-five years globally is eroding from its base. On the other hand, the challenge to that socio-economic agenda is emerging from the global South with Asia at its centre. Meanwhile, the elite ruling class of our country, under the guise of finding a solution to the economic crisis they created, declared bankruptcy through the Governor of the Central Bank. As a result, Sri Lanka has now been placed under the International Monetary Fund’s ‘Stabilisation’ and the World Bank’s ‘Structural Reforms’ programmes. According to the conditions of the IMF, State-owned properties are being sold, while oppressing the people’s voice. In order to suppress the rising protests of the people against implementation of these conditions, the elite rulers are resorting to State terror against the people, especially the working people. Right now, the Government is continuing to oppress the people curtailing social security programmes, cutting public facilities such as health and education. Working women and especially, workers in the informal sector are being burdened with high cost of living. Therefore, on May Day this year, all those who are suffering due to these evil acts of the Government, should endeavour to get organised to oppose these anti-people measures. Apart from this, the working community of Sri Lanka are celebrating this May Day, at a time when the common man is rallying round the JJB to find a solution to their problems after 75 years. The elite rulers, who are anxious about this, are postponing elections and showing the true colours of so-called neoliberal democracy. Therefore, at this time, the responsibility of establishing democracy too lies with the common people. It is imperative that allpro- democratic factions unite to oust the corrupt rulers and to establish a peoples’ government. Under these circumstances, the JJB is ready to celebrate International May Day with the working community and we extend our wishes to the people on this day,” the JJB said.    "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Government should step in and assist those already involved in combating this menace, said former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. She was speaking at the launch of ‘Chronicles of Melancholy’ true life stories of child abuse survivors, organised by Stop Child Cruelty Trust (SCC) and Child Protection Alliance recently. She alleged that responsible State institutions were not responding during some cases of child abuse and shared a firsthand experience where the relevant authorities had been very indolent. “I even made personal requests to the authorities requesting action to be taken  regarding the issue, but they did not accede to the request. Even a former President of the country cannot get support in a case of child abuse to save ordinary people. The Government should look into these issues and ensure the efficiency of these institutions,” she said. On a further note, she claimed that women are also victimised in society and  records of abuse and harassment on women have escalated during recent times. “Our society has become a very unsafe place for women. Numerous friends and relatives who visit Sri Lanka from foreign lands, claim our public transportation to be unsafe. They are intimidated by the behaviour of Sri Lankan men. Not only foreigners, evena local woman can’t travel alone these days. And domestic violence is on a high.” The former President expressed her displeasure over the way the Police were dealing with cases of sexual abuse. “Women are unsure of seeking help from the Police, because most Police Officers would end up embarrassing the victim  and sometimes even try to put the blame on the woman’s dress or find something else to blame it on” “There are several individuals and organisations like SCC and Child Protection Alliance that work against child and women abuse, and I personally work with most of them. I am ready to give any support to them in the future as well. But all our work is just a small drop in the ocean. We can’t progress further, unless the Government gives its fullest support,” she said. By Induwara Athapattu"

The neo-liberal capitalist social economic system that dominated the world for forty-five years globally is eroding from its base. On the other hand, the challenge to that socio-economic agenda is emerging from the global South with Asia at its centre. Meanwhile, the elite ruling class of our country, under the guise of finding a solution to the economic crisis they created, declared bankruptcy through the Governor of the Central Bank. As a result, Sri Lanka has now been placed under the International Monetary Fund’s ‘Stabilisation’ and the World Bank’s ‘Structural Reforms’ programmes. According to the conditions of the IMF, State-owned properties are being sold, while oppressing the people’s voice. In order to suppress the rising protests of the people against implementation of these conditions, the elite rulers are resorting to State terror against the people, especially the working people. Right now, the Government is continuing to oppress the people curtailing social security programmes, cutting public facilities such as health and education. Working women and especially, workers in the informal sector are being burdened with high cost of living. Therefore, on May Day this year, all those who are suffering due to these evil acts of the Government, should endeavour to get organised to oppose these anti-people measures. Apart from this, the working community of Sri Lanka are celebrating this May Day, at a time when the common man is rallying round the JJB to find a solution to their problems after 75 years. The elite rulers, who are anxious about this, are postponing elections and showing the true colours of so-called neoliberal democracy. Therefore, at this time, the responsibility of establishing democracy too lies with the common people. It is imperative that allpro- democratic factions unite to oust the corrupt rulers and to establish a peoples’ government. Under these circumstances, the JJB is ready to celebrate International May Day with the working community and we extend our wishes to the people on this day,” the JJB said.    "

Currently, old stocks were available but some ward doctors have to utilise available rough and any other available paper to write case details of each patient owing to the paper shortage and not the paper meant for the purpose. They also called for an investigation into the death of the seven-year-old child in Gampola, as a result of an overdose of paracetamol, adding one cannot think of what the situation might be in the peripheries if even the large State hospitals were facing such issues. The death occurred at Gampola Kurunduwatte Divisional Hospital. It was revealed that owing to a shortage of prescription envelopes, medicines are dispensed in old electricity bills or paper chits. Owing to an influx of patients, certain generic medications such as paracetamol have already been wrapped and kept, with the recommended dose written on the inside of the paper. As a result, paracetamol issued for the child had also been given from one such pre-prepared stock, in which the dosage usually prescribed for adults was written on the inside. Despite the recommended dosage for the seven-year-old having been written on the outside of the relevant packaging, the parents of the child had failed to see this and they had administered the drug at a dosage much higher than that usually prescribed for children, resulting in the child’s death.

Ali Sabry expressed Sri Lanka’s grave concerns associated with this decision to the US Ambassador Julie Chung yesterday (27). “As a longstanding bilateral partner of Sri Lanka, such unilateral action by the US, without following due process, is counter-productive to the holistic approach that Sri Lanka has taken on addressing national unity and reconciliation. It is also unfortunate that the announcement emanates against the backdrop of tangible progress made by the Government in strengthening the country’s democratic governance and reconciliation structures. Despite these challenges, Sri Lanka will continue in its on-going efforts to achieve reconciliation, economic recovery and socio-economic development,” the Minister said.

Nanayakkara, addressing a media briefing, said his Cabinet proposal to increase the duty-free allowance given to expatriate workers at the airport, was approved and the circular was issued after that. As per the circular, expatriate workers who legally send money to Sri Lanka, through the banking system, are eligible to receive an increased duty-free allowance. The amount of money sent through the banking system, since the first of May last year, will be taken into account and this concession will be given under five categories. Accordingly, the workers who have sent between USD 2,400 and 4,799 will get an additional duty-free allowance of USD 600 and workers who have remitted between USD 4,800 and 7,199 will get an additional allowance of USD 960.  Workers who have sent between USD 7,200 and USD 11,999 will receive an additional duty-free allowance of USD 1,440. Expatriate workers who have remitted between USD 12,000 – USD 23,999 can get USD 2,400 and workers who have sent USD 24,000 or more can get an additional USD 4,800 duty-free allowance. Nanayakkara said, “It is very important to direct the workers for foreign jobs and it is equally important to bring the money they earn to the country through legal channels. We have worked hard for that in the past. At a time when the amount of remittances received from expatriate workers had dropped to 190 million dollars, when some went to other countries and told workers not to send money to the country, and while some chose illegal methods such as undiyal to send money, we implemented several measures to rectify these issues. After understanding how the people of our country were suffering, our expatriate workers once again started sending money to the country through the banking system. Several programmes were implemented to bring money to the country through safe and legal channels.” According to the minister, an import license was introduced for migrant workers to import electric vehicles. We have also arranged to provide duty concessions to expatriate workers. Accordingly, the circular was issued to increase the duty-free allowance for expatriate workers at the airport. “As per the circular, the increase in the duty-free allowance for expatriate workers at the airport will be implemented from the first of May. The facility is available through an App operated by the Central Bank. By registering through this App, it is possible to get an additional duty-free allowance based on the amount of dollars sent to the country. Last week, Cabinet approval was obtained to introduce a low-interest loan system for expatriate workers. Accordingly, expatriate workers can get loan facilities up to two million rupees. Also, the President presented his observations to the Cabinet and informed the Cabinet that a programme should be implemented for the workers who have returned to this country after working abroad,” he said. Furthermore, Nanayakkara said some time back, expatriate workers were called heroes of the country. “Then during the Corona period, they were treated as human bombs. False information was circulated that expatriate workers returning to the country will put the country in peril during the covid pandemic. They were mistreated and embezzled during quarantine. Against this backdrop, the initiatives taken by the new government gave the expatriate workers new hope and the foreign remittances started flowing again through legal channels,” he said."

The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

A similar fall was last witnessed in the immediate aftermath of ‘Easter Sunday terror attacks 2019’ that took place on 21 April 2019, where the stock market fell for 10 consecutive market days, then. Subsequently, the benchmark ASPI, yesterday over the previous day Tuesday (25) fell by 0.37 per cent to 9,091.72 points and the more sensitive S&P SL 20 Index by 0.39 per cent to 2,646.48 points on a low Rs 740.53 million turnover. Prior to yesterday, the  stock market last fell for at least eight consecutive market days was from 2 May 2019 to 15 May 2019, where it declined for 10 consecutive market days then, buffeted by ‘Bloody Easter Sunday’ which took place on 21 April 2019. Meanwhile, market indices last registered lower figures than the above was 65 calendar days ago on 20 February with the ASPI registering value of 9,082.33 points and the S&P SL 20 Index, 2,644.27 points, respectively. A high interest rate regime is inimical to the growth of the bourse as then; investors are attracted to the fixed income market, rather than to the latter.

In a special statement during the debate on agreeing with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Parliament yesterday (26), the President said various sectors cannot put conditions at a time when the country is gradually moving forward. “However, this matter will be discussed in Parliament and a decision will be taken in Parliament as well.” The relevant sectors will be informed following that,” he said. President Wickremesinghe announced that Sri Lanka is on the path of renaissance and is re-emerging as a success story, with the expectation of support from the entire nation to carry it forward. The President highlighted the progress made in the Sri Lankan economy, which had previously collapsed due to riots, arson, and state bankruptcy. In just eight months, the country has turned its fortunes around and is now known as the ‘Sri Lanka comeback story’. The President also spoke about the IMF agreement, which he presented to Parliament. He acknowledged that the country had failed to implement previous agreements with the IMF despite entering into 16 such agreements. However, the President said there is no other active option for Sri Lanka but to sign an agreement with the IMF at present. He reassured the public that the restructuring of local debt would not harm members of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). Furthermore, he stated that a social safety net has been implemented to protect low-income earners and create financial stability in the country. With these measures in place, the President is optimistic about Sri Lanka’s future and urged the nation to work together towards a brighter future. “As soon as I took over the Government, I began negotiations with the IMF, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. As a result, in September, we reached an agreement with the IMF regarding extended credit facilities. The comprehensive credit facility consists of six major reforms; Revenue-based Fiscal Consolidation, Restructuring of Public Debt, implementation of multiple strategies to ensure the restoration of financial stability, including the formation of foreign reserves under a flexible foreign exchange rate regime, implementation of relevant policies and reforms to ensure the stability of the financial sector, implementation of structural reforms necessary to control corruption–In this regard, the Minister will present the relevant draft and taking necessary measures to enhance economic growth” Today, we received the financing assurance from foreign creditors, with the Paris Club and India working together to grant it. India was the first to publish it, and we are grateful for that. China is expected to deal with it separately, so we will discuss with the Paris Club and India on one hand and negotiate with China on the other. After these discussions, we will have talks with private creditors. This agreement will enable us to receive approximately USD3 billion from the International Monetary Fund over the next four years, with the potential to obtain about USD7 billion from other institutions. This money is crucial for us, the President said. “Additionally, we have regained the trust of foreign banks and financial institutions, with economic stability already being established in the country. Social Security is receiving more funding, and investors are showing a keen interest in Sri Lanka. We have entered into agreements with the IMF 16 times in the past, but we have not fully implemented them. On the 17th occasion, when we achieve stability, we must address our long-term weaknesses and move forward with a new programme” The President said Sri Lanka must first negotiate with foreign creditors. “We hope to initiate these discussions soon, with domestic debt restructuring also being considered. A final decision has not yet been made, but it is important to discuss this issue. Negotiations cannot be held with terms and conditions already in place. It is easier for us to join negotiations without conditions. Some Banks may express their inability to cope with the programme, but it is important for them to accept it in order to move the economy forward. There are concerns that the stock market may collapse, and some may not be able to offer different conditions. However, decisions will be made in Parliament, and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that no harm is done to anyone, such as the members of the EPF.” “We have initiated necessary programmes to support the poor, and the World Bank has provided funding for this. We are currently implementing a programme to give aid to those who truly deserve it and remove those who do not. Our aim is to create financial stability and protect the low-income people. To achieve these objectives, we are holding joint discussions with the Paris Club and India on one platform, while separate negotiations with China are also underway. We have nothing to hide, and several steps need to be taken in this regard. The Central government tax revenue flow  in 2022 was Rs 1 Trillion  751,000,   end March it was   Rs 650 billion. I must say we have fallen short in some areas such as the Customs because imports have been reduced, but on the other hand we have increased direct taxation. The tax revenue final target for the end of the year is Rs 2.9 billion.” “Parliamentary approval of the new Central Bank Act will be tabled in Parliament next month .Completion of the asset quality review component of bank diagnostic exercise for the two largest State-owned banks and the three largest private sector banks will be done. Parliamentary approval of the welfare benefit payment scheme and the application of the new eligibility criteria to identify low-income families will be obtained for receiving welfare benefit payments by end of May. Cabinet approval would be obtained for a comprehensive strategy to restructure the balance sheets of the CEB, CPC, SriLankan Airlines, and the Road Development Authority by end of June, Cabinet approval also will be obtained for a full revision of the Banking Act by end of June. Also new anti-competition legislation will be enacted to harmonise it with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, pending comprehensive asset recovery provisions by end of June,” the President said. Appropriation Bill 2024 will be presented to Parliament by end of October, he said. “Under staff baseline scenario, USD 17 billion in debt service reduction is required, including the arrears accumulated in 2022.So we are trying to get a USD 17 billion debt reduction on that side. Do you want it or not. Are we going in for debt restricting? We can’t manage without debt restructuring. That is what I want to make it clear to all the members.” “Various restrictions have been imposed for 25 to 30 years, depending on the preferences of each ministry. Let us now look at the economy and decide which limits will be retained and which will be lifted.  A highly competitive social fair market system is required. We require a green economy. The economy must be digitalised. There are several activities available for this. Agriculture is being modernized, and new industries are being introduced. That is something I will address separately,” “Now we have to build the country for 2048. If we do not accomplish this, we would be betraying the country’s youth. Their future has been destroyed. Think about the youth of the country. Don’t just think about grabbing power only. If this program is not done, none of us will be able to survive in another two or three years. So I urge everyone to come together to approve this. After that we will come together and prepare the set of policies required until 2048. I also, urge you to provide support to implement the programme during the next five years,” he said."

A final decision has not yet been made, but it is important to discuss this issue. Negotiations cannot be held with terms and conditions already in place. It is easier for us to join negotiations without conditions. Some Banks may express their inability to cope with the programme, but it is important for them to accept it in order to move the economy forward. There are concerns that the stock market may collapse, and some may not be able to offer different conditions. However, decisions will be made in Parliament, and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that no harm is done to anyone, such as the members of the EPF.” “We have initiated necessary programmes to support the poor, and the World Bank has provided funding for this. We are currently implementing a programme to give aid to those who truly deserve it and remove those who do not. Our aim is to create financial stability and protect the low-income people. To achieve these objectives, we are holding joint discussions with the Paris Club and India on one platform, while separate negotiations with China are also underway. We have nothing to hide, and several steps need to be taken in this regard. The Central government tax revenue flow  in 2022 was Rs 1 Trillion  751,000,   end March it was   Rs 650 billion. I must say we have fallen short in some areas such as the Customs because imports have been reduced, but on the other hand we have increased direct taxation. The tax revenue final target for the end of the year is Rs 2.9 billion.” “Parliamentary approval of the new Central Bank Act will be tabled in Parliament next month .Completion of the asset quality review component of bank diagnostic exercise for the two largest State-owned banks and the three largest private sector banks will be done. Parliamentary approval of the welfare benefit payment scheme and the application of the new eligibility criteria to identify low-income families will be obtained for receiving welfare benefit payments by end of May. Cabinet approval would be obtained for a comprehensive strategy to restructure the balance sheets of the CEB, CPC, SriLankan Airlines, and the Road Development Authority by end of June, Cabinet approval also will be obtained for a full revision of the Banking Act by end of June. Also new anti-competition legislation will be enacted to harmonise it with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, pending comprehensive asset recovery provisions by end of June,” the President said. Appropriation Bill 2024 will be presented to Parliament by end of October, he said. “Under staff baseline scenario, USD 17 billion in debt service reduction is required, including the arrears accumulated in 2022.So we are trying to get a USD 17 billion debt reduction on that side. Do you want it or not. Are we going in for debt restricting? We can’t manage without debt restructuring. That is what I want to make it clear to all the members.” “Various restrictions have been imposed for 25 to 30 years, depending on the preferences of each ministry. Let us now look at the economy and decide which limits will be retained and which will be lifted.  A highly competitive social fair market system is required. We require a green economy. The economy must be digitalised. There are several activities available for this. Agriculture is being modernized, and new industries are being introduced. That is something I will address separately,” “Now we have to build the country for 2048. If we do not accomplish this, we would be betraying the country’s youth. Their future has been destroyed. Think about the youth of the country. Don’t just think about grabbing power only. If this program is not done, none of us will be able to survive in another two or three years. So I urge everyone to come together to approve this. After that we will come together and prepare the set of policies required until 2048. I also, urge you to provide support to implement the programme during the next five years,” he said."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Joe-Pete cricket encounter, more popularly known as the ‘Battle of the Saints’, is a much- awaited event in the College calendar due to the quality of cricket and spirit in which the game has been played and its rich traditions. The Battle of the Saints is renowned for its exciting and competitive brand of cricket. The Joe-Pete Encounter is going to be an interesting one as the players have undergone rigorous training and will showcase their prowess. It is not going to be a cakewalk for either of the teams as every player is brilliant and unique in his own capacity and every one of them is in a class of his own. Needless to say, sports make us healthy and strong and not only teaches us to celebrate victory, but also accept defeat with grace and magnanimity. Such lessons lay a firm foundation for success in later life. The organisation of matches is improving every year and we are glad that we are providing the opportunity to many budding players to hone their skills so that they could one day showcase their talent nationally and internationally. We wish to record that the Josephian-Peterite Limited Overs cricket version is the oldest encounter in the Island. St Joseph’s College, Colombo is a premier Catholic School in Sri Lanka and has a history for excellence in Education, Sports, Extra Curricular activities and spiritual uplift over 127 years. We should reflect on the past and always ask ourselves what have we done or achieved recently. In this context, I am delighted to state that currently Josephians are the Under-19 Inter School Division One Tier A, 2-Day Joint Champions. We are now endeavouring to maintain the high standards to secure many more victories in the future, as well. At St. Joseph’s College in keeping with our vision, we aim to nurture innate talent, abilities and capabilities and develop multi-talent and skills to bring out the best from the Josephian fraternity in order to produce resolute leaders to our College, the Motherland and the universe. Our College has produced a galaxy of multi-talented exemplary leaders in all walks of life including professional cricketers to the nation and overseas. In this context, we have produced many national caps and legendary cricketers. With their dynamic leadership, knowledge, skills, talents, expertise, versatile experience besides sportsmanship, these cricketers have maintained the high standards of our College, thus brought glory and honour to our Alma Mater and our Motherland. I am glad to state that these great cricketers have helped our Nation to secure many noteworthy achievements in cricket thus making our Country victorious on many occasions in spite of facing their strong opponents in the game of cricket. They were the cream of the Sri Lankan Cricket team which played with devotion and diligence. It is my duty to mention the names of those cricketers at this juncture and thank them for keeping the College and National flags flying high and for their valuable contribution to our College and Sri Lankan cricket. The elite panel includes our current skipper Dimuthu Karunaratne, former skipper Angelo Mathews, legendary paceman Chaminda Vaas, Dunith Wellalage, who was the National Under -19 Captain and present promising national all-rounder, Ashley de Silva, the CEO of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), Thisara Perera, Michael Van Dort, Roshen Silva, Priyamal Perera and Sadeera Samarawickrama. I am sure that both teams will play exciting cricket to entertain both the young and old Peterites and Josephians. Finally, let me wish the captains and both teams the very best to deliver two days of exhilarating cricket besides success in their future endeavours to become tomorrow’s national cricketers.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Private bus services came to a standstill in Northern cities. However, some restaurants and pharmacies remained open to the public in the North. The call for a hartal by the TNA, was accepted by all Tamil political parties operating in the North and East, to express their strong opposition to the Government’s gazetted Anti-Terrorism Bill (ATB) and alleged “Sinhala-Buddhisization” in the North and East. During the one-day hartal, activities of schools and universities came to a standstill. Also, many State-run banks and private banks were shut in several towns in those two provinces. In the Jaffna District, most of the commercial centres and markets were closed, but pockets of activity was observed. All commercial activities ceased and Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, Batticaloa, Mannar and several other locations were deserted. However, some essential services including a few restaurants and pharmacies remained open to the public. In the Jaffna District, all commercial centres and markets were closed and traders wholeheartedly endorsed the shutdown called for by the Tamil parties. Also, Batticaloa town was deserted yesterday, with all schools and banks and State institutions shut. The Trincomalee District too remained sombre in support of the hartal called for by Tamil political parties, although some shops remained open to the public. Business establishments and schools in Trincomalee town and suburban areas were closed in support of the hartal. There weren’t many vehicles on the road.

Responding to a question raised by a journalist, Gunawardena said it would be a serious situation if the country cannot come to a common ground with regard to increasing income and cutting expenditure, in a backdrop where Sri Lanka has signed an agreement aimed at recovering from the economic crisis. To gain the trust of international community, we have to adhere to such agreements. Otherwise, it would be difficult to recover from the current situation, he said. Speaking further, Gunawardena said Sri Lanka has already neglected the conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 16 times. “If we continue to do that, the country will be placed in a difficult situation in the international arena. It will be a disgrace to the country as well. The Government is making every effort to increase income in order to rescue the country,” Gunawardena added. BY Mithun Jayawardena"

O/L Examination not be conducted this year but that the students be provided with a certificate stating that they are qualified to enrol in A/L classes. Alahapperuma said that there is a situation at the moment where nearly 600,000 students are unable to move beyond the O/L stage. “So, why can’t we hold the exam this year? Instead Department of Examinations can issue certificates to students who have fulfilled the requirements to enrol in  A/L classes?” he queried.  Alahapperuma said during the Covid-19 pandemic, a similar decision was taken pertaining to the London O/L examinations. Education Minister Susil Premajayantha responded saying that the latter’s proposal is impractical in the current context. “The testing and evaluation process followed in the London syllabus is different from the local exams. In the London syllabus, the students are being evaluated in classroom continuously and those results are added to the final marks. We still have an exam-centric syllabus,” the Minister pointed out.

The Grade 2 student of the Uduwella Primary school, developed a fever and was given the paracetamol by the Gampola Kurunduwatte hospital. The post-mortem revealed that the child had died of paracetamol overdose. The child had been taken to the hospital twice, as she developed a fever. Whilst the doctor had specified a certain dosage of paracetamol for the child, the hospital pharmacist had written a dosage generally prescribed for adults, resulting in the overdose. Whilst the hospital has over 600 patients daily, there is only one pharmacist at the hospital pharmacy. Further, as the hospital is short of packets to provide medicine, they wrap medicine in paper or old electricity bills. Due to a high number of patients at the hospital, paracetamol and several other medicine have been already been wrapped in paper with a prescribed dosage for adults written in it. However, the dosage for children is usually written at the back of the packet. The parents of the seven-year old have given the child the dosage prescribed inside of the packet, which is for adults. The child has then developed a stomach pain and she was taken to the hospital on 22 April in a critical state. Whilst the child was directed to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the beds in the ICU of the Gampola, Peradeniya, Nawalapitiya and Kandy hospitalsd had been full, due to which the child was taken to the Teaching Hospital, Ragama. Due to the increased pain suffered by the child, she was anesthetised, following which she died the same evening. The post mortem revealed that the overdose had severally affected the child’s lung.

Also, I don’t know whether this can be used as evidence in the case too. The Ministry of Defence and the Police should conduct investigations to find the truth,” the minister said. Speaking further, Rajapakshe said a limitation procedure has been filed in the UK to limit the damages which the Sri Lankan Government could claim. Meanwhile, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) queried as to why the case pertaining to obtaining compensation, for the damages caused by the X-Press Pearl fire, was filed in a Singapore Court when, according to the experts, it could have been filed in a local Court. Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella alleged that this move of the Government indicates that it does not trust Sri Lanka’s judicial system. Rajapakshe who responded said it is wrong and unfair to make such statements. “According to the normal procedure, these types of cases are filed in judicial zones where the complainant party had the best advantage. The Committee of experts, which was appointed to look into securing damages, including Ronald Perera, PC and Chandaka Jayasundera, PC also wanted to file the case in a local Court.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Court also issued an interim order preventing the arrest of the former AG pending the hearing and determination of the Writ Application filed in this connection. This was when the said Writ Application, filed by de Livera, seeking an order preventing him from being so summoned or arrested was taken up before Courts. The former Attorney General was previously summoned by the TID on 19 April to record a statement pertaining to an alleged statement made by him, during his tenure as AG, that there was a certain conspiracy regarding the Easter Sunday attacks. However, he did not appear before the TID but a seven-page objection was filed on his behalf. Whilst the former Attorney General was summoned before the TID for the second time yesterday (24), the relevant Writ Application was filed by him seeking an order preventing the recording of a statement from him. It was noted in the Writ Application that statement in question was made by him in his capacity as the Attorney General in the public interest. It was also noted that as per the documentation made available to him at the time, there appeared to be a conspiracy in respect of the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks.

It was also observed that since he had retired as Attorney General, he does not possess any documentation in relation to this matter or any other matter pertaining to the discharge of his duties. The Petitioner pleaded that there cannot be any rational reason to question him at this stage, with regard to an interview made by him in his official capacity as Attorney General more than two years ago. The Petitioner further went on to observe that to question him in connection with the interview given by him in his official capacity as Attorney General to the media or to record a statement  is patently unlawful. It was also stated that the former Attorney General fears that there is a serious and imminent likelihood of him being arrested and that in the event he is arrested, there is a grave likelihood he would be detained without having access to bail. The former Attorney General also observed that on 21 April, a group of persons, said to be Police officers, had rung the bell at his residence, while banging on the door and calling out for him, thereafter persons at his residence had informed the said persons at the door that the Petitioner was not at home. It was observed that notwithstanding the same, the said persons remained outside the gate of the Petitioner’s residence and when the Petitioner’s son returned from work, the said persons had tried to follow him into the residence by force, wrongfully and/or unlawfully and/or without any authority whatsoever. Having been unable to enter the premises, the Petitioner stated that the said persons remained outside the premises for a long period of time while continuing to ring the bell and bang on the gate.  Thereby, following consideration of the Writ Application, Court issued an interim order preventing his arrest pending the hearing and determination of the Application. Court also issued an interim order preventing the questioning of the Petitioner, with regards to anything done by him in the course of discharging his duties in the capacity of Attorney General, pending the hearing and determination of the Application. Further, Court also issued an interim order preventing respondents from recording a statement from the Petitioner in regard to the interview/statement given by him in his capacity as Attorney General, pending the hearing and determination of this matter.

A 51-year-old deportee from Germany was arrested by Police on Saturday night in Punguduthivu over the murders. Three women and two men had succumbed to injuries by the time the incident was reported while another 100- year-old woman, who sustained injuries is being treated at Jaffna Hospital. According to Police the murders have taken place at around 4.00 a.m. on Saturday. The house owner Karthikesu Nagasundari (74), Naganathy Balasingham (75), his wife Balasingham Kanmanipillai (72), Velayutham Pillai Nagaratnam (76) and Subramaniam Mahadevan (78), who were closely related to each other were killed. Of the five murdered, two were expatriate Tamils from the United Kingdom. When a dog had barked to alert the neighbourhood, the suspect is alleged to have attempted to kill the dog but the animal had escaped with a cut injuries.  The owner of the house, who was living close to the Navy Camp in Nedundivu Mavali Jetty had been providing accommodation and food to people visiting the Delft Island. Her husband was also one of the Kumudini massacre victim and ever since then she had been living alone renting her house to earn a living. One was found dead outside the house and others inside the house on the bed and floor. The 8 km-long Deflt Island,  with its unique landscape of corals, white sandy beaches, and horses, had a population of over 25, 000 families before the civil war, but it has now been reduced to about 2,500 families. Those who have lived overseas have begun to arrive in their villages in the Northern Province. The five elderly people had come to Nedunthivu for their ancestral Hindu temple festival, travelling all the way from the United Kingdom.  The suspect was identified as Sabaratnam Raghu, in his early 50s, who was deported from Germany following the prosecution of an attempted murder case against him there. He is also suspected to be a drug addict but it is yet to be confirmed. He was apprehended while hiding in the neighbouring island, Punguduthivu on Saturday night. Apparently after the murder the suspect had boarded the first bus to Karikkatuwan and from there ferried to Pungudutivu. Also Minister of Fisheries, Douglas Devananda, who arrived at the Delft Island, said all those involved in the brutal murders should be brought to justice after impartial inquiry. He also stressed on the security of the people who are living in a fear psychosis over the shocking murders.  Magistrate Gajanithibalan visited Nedundivu and conducted investigations. Meanwhile, the Jaffna Forensic Police Team and the Judicial Medical Officer went to the spot and conducted investigations. The people in the area staged a protest when the Magistrate had arrived at the house where the incident took place. They protested demanding that the criminals should be identified immediately and given the maximum punishment and the safety of the people of Nedundivu should be ensured. The suspect had said that he had been visiting the elderly often and also stayed couple of days with the elderly people in that house, which is at close proximity to the Sri Lanka Navy checkpoint. “I was staying at their house. I decided to steal the jewellery they were wearing because I needed money. If I stole the jewellery alone, I would get caught so I killed them all to divert suspicion,” the suspect in his early 50s had revealed to the Police. Police said that 26 sovereign of gold jewellery, clothes and mobile phones were seized from the suspect. Those five murdered with brutal cuts were recovered from a house near the Sri Lanka Naval camp in the 12th division of Delft Island, near the Mavili jetty. A 100-year-old woman who was rescued in critical condition and admitted to Jaffna Teaching Hospital for treatment has been recounting her ordeal. In relation to the event, a Police team led by Inspector Sai Menon and advised by Jaffna Regional Senior Superintendent of Police Vishanth launched an expedited inquiry on the orders of Jaffna District Deputy Inspector General of Police Manjula Senarath. According to the information gathered by the Police, the suspect who had roamed in Nendutivu left Delft Island early Saturday morning. A 51-year-old man was arrested and deported to Sri Lanka after being found guilty of attempted murder in Germany. He was arrested with a large amount of gold jewellery. During the investigation, the suspect confessed., “If I come to Nedundivu, I used to stay at the home of the elderly people. I stayed there  a few days ago. These expats were wearing gold jewellery. I planned to go back to Germany and for that purpose I had to make my passport and needed money to go back to Germany, he had confessed. Further he had said, “So, on Saturday morning at about 4.30 am I planned to kill everyone who was sleeping and take the jewellery and escape. I killed them all to divert the police investigation,” the suspect told Police. He also said that he dropped the knife he used in the killings in a well in Neduntivu. The suspect was taken to the Delft Island to collect evidences related to the murder. Pix by T. Pratheepan – Jaffna Correspondent By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan and T. Pratheepan"

Moreover, the event continues to unfold, and its active pollution generation phase will only come to a  with the elimination of the risks from the wreck and containers lost at sea. The Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) warned on 4 April that if legal action is not instituted in connection with the MV X-Press Pearl ship fire before 29 May, Sri Lanka will have to forfeit its right to compensation worth an estimated USD 10 billion. The Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) said it has provided all necessary documents to the Attorney General’s Department to prosecute the ship owner or the operator or the ship’s agents in Sri Lanka under the Criminal Law, in terms of Section 26 of the Prevention of Maritime Corruption Act. Meanwhile, environmentalists say that going to Singapore has its disadvantages for Sri Lanka as there are many International Conventions that apply in Singapore, as opposed to Sri Lanka. Attorney -at-Law/Legal Counsel, an expert in Law of the Sea and Maritime Law Dr. Dan Malika Gunasekera, in a recent interview with Ceylon Today, said  the Sri Lankan Marine Pollution Prevention Act and other laws cannot be used in Singapore and further emphasised that Sri Lanka is under no obligation to travel to Singapore and that the Cabinet and Parliament could revert the decision in doing so, in order to bring a lawsuit against the X-press Pearl vessel, which had polluted the country’s ecosystem, in Sri Lanka."

Advanced Level examination 2022 answer scripts, would be confiscated, the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations (FUTA) said it might decide to voluntarily return to paper marking, once the President’s threat fails and are confident that they would not be bullied or threatened by anyone. It is only out of consideration for students’ and parents’ concerns, FUTA said in a statement. “We will never give up our struggle until the people of this country triumph, but we may change the focus and direction of our trade union action so as to ease the public burden as we continue to fight for justice and fairness, both for our members and the country at large,” the statement said. Challenging the President, FUTA said it wishes to call the President’s bluff and challenge him to implement his threat against university academics in the country. “He has stated that he will declare Education as an Essential Service and prosecute all academics who do not comply with his draconian regulations. He has gone on record threatening all of us that at the end of this week he will begin arresting us and confiscating our property,” FUTA added. “Yet, he is deafeningly silent about the ill-gotten gains of politicians who destroyed and bankrupted this country! Mr. President, this threat is both illegal and unjust, so we challenge you to do your worst. GCE Advanced Level marking is an additional activity that university academics perform as a national service. It is not part of our regular duties, nor, it should be noted, are we even paid properly for this work. Many of us have not even been remunerated the pittance due to us for work done in 2022.  “We wish to clarify that the President’s hypocritical concern for AL students is not matched by his Government withholding even basic resources from the university and school systems. The universities are now expected to run without recruiting staff even for existing vacancies, basic supplies are being withheld, student grants and loans are not being paid and hostel and canteen facilities are woefully inadequate. Hundreds of students cannot follow courses due to financial and other constraints. Teachers cannot teach due to lack of space and materials. If the Government was really concerned about students and their education, surely, much more would have been done to alleviate this crisis, instead of pretending that AL marking is the only deadlock,” FUTA said."

A 51-year-old deportee from Germany was arrested by Police on Saturday night in Punguduthivu over the murders. Three women and two men had succumbed to injuries by the time the incident was reported while another 100- year-old woman, who sustained injuries is being treated at Jaffna Hospital. According to Police the murders have taken place at around 4.00 a.m. on Saturday. The house owner Karthikesu Nagasundari (74), Naganathy Balasingham (75), his wife Balasingham Kanmanipillai (72), Velayutham Pillai Nagaratnam (76) and Subramaniam Mahadevan (78), who were closely related to each other were killed. Of the five murdered, two were expatriate Tamils from the United Kingdom. When a dog had barked to alert the neighbourhood, the suspect is alleged to have attempted to kill the dog but the animal had escaped with a cut injuries.  The owner of the house, who was living close to the Navy Camp in Nedundivu Mavali Jetty had been providing accommodation and food to people visiting the Delft Island. Her husband was also one of the Kumudini massacre victim and ever since then she had been living alone renting her house to earn a living. One was found dead outside the house and others inside the house on the bed and floor. The 8 km-long Deflt Island,  with its unique landscape of corals, white sandy beaches, and horses, had a population of over 25, 000 families before the civil war, but it has now been reduced to about 2,500 families. Those who have lived overseas have begun to arrive in their villages in the Northern Province. The five elderly people had come to Nedunthivu for their ancestral Hindu temple festival, travelling all the way from the United Kingdom.  The suspect was identified as Sabaratnam Raghu, in his early 50s, who was deported from Germany following the prosecution of an attempted murder case against him there. He is also suspected to be a drug addict but it is yet to be confirmed. He was apprehended while hiding in the neighbouring island, Punguduthivu on Saturday night. Apparently after the murder the suspect had boarded the first bus to Karikkatuwan and from there ferried to Pungudutivu. Also Minister of Fisheries, Douglas Devananda, who arrived at the Delft Island, said all those involved in the brutal murders should be brought to justice after impartial inquiry. He also stressed on the security of the people who are living in a fear psychosis over the shocking murders.  Magistrate Gajanithibalan visited Nedundivu and conducted investigations. Meanwhile, the Jaffna Forensic Police Team and the Judicial Medical Officer went to the spot and conducted investigations. The people in the area staged a protest when the Magistrate had arrived at the house where the incident took place. They protested demanding that the criminals should be identified immediately and given the maximum punishment and the safety of the people of Nedundivu should be ensured. The suspect had said that he had been visiting the elderly often and also stayed couple of days with the elderly people in that house, which is at close proximity to the Sri Lanka Navy checkpoint. “I was staying at their house. I decided to steal the jewellery they were wearing because I needed money. If I stole the jewellery alone, I would get caught so I killed them all to divert suspicion,” the suspect in his early 50s had revealed to the Police. Police said that 26 sovereign of gold jewellery, clothes and mobile phones were seized from the suspect. Those five murdered with brutal cuts were recovered from a house near the Sri Lanka Naval camp in the 12th division of Delft Island, near the Mavili jetty. A 100-year-old woman who was rescued in critical condition and admitted to Jaffna Teaching Hospital for treatment has been recounting her ordeal. In relation to the event, a Police team led by Inspector Sai Menon and advised by Jaffna Regional Senior Superintendent of Police Vishanth launched an expedited inquiry on the orders of Jaffna District Deputy Inspector General of Police Manjula Senarath. According to the information gathered by the Police, the suspect who had roamed in Nendutivu left Delft Island early Saturday morning. A 51-year-old man was arrested and deported to Sri Lanka after being found guilty of attempted murder in Germany. He was arrested with a large amount of gold jewellery. During the investigation, the suspect confessed., “If I come to Nedundivu, I used to stay at the home of the elderly people. I stayed there  a few days ago. These expats were wearing gold jewellery. I planned to go back to Germany and for that purpose I had to make my passport and needed money to go back to Germany, he had confessed. Further he had said, “So, on Saturday morning at about 4.30 am I planned to kill everyone who was sleeping and take the jewellery and escape. I killed them all to divert the police investigation,” the suspect told Police. He also said that he dropped the knife he used in the killings in a well in Neduntivu. The suspect was taken to the Delft Island to collect evidences related to the murder. Pix by T. Pratheepan – Jaffna Correspondent By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan and T. Pratheepan"

The 4 million Euro (approximately  Rs 1.5 billion) initiative funded by the EU was initiated at an event held at the Bataatha Agro Technology park in Hambanthota under the auspices of Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera, EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Denis Chaibi and FAO Representative in Sri Lanka, Vimlendra Sharan. Implemented by FAO with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Mahaweli Authority, the programme targets 71,000 smallholder paddy farmers and 1,200 paddy seed farmers across seven districts including Polonnaruwa, Badulla, Ampara, Matale, Puttalam, Kurunegala and Hambantota Districts who were severely impacted by the recent-economic crisis. Speaking at the event, which saw the official start of the farmer field schools, EU Ambassador Chaibi said, “With this new action, we want to help farmers not only to grow more, but most importantly to grow better so that they can increase their production and incomes, but also protect the environment around them. We hope that together with FAO and the Government of Sri Lanka we can gradually promote a transition towards greener and climate-smart agriculture. Transition  that produces sufficient amount of food, while protecting the planet and its people.” The recipient farmers will receive material and technical support to transition from traditional cultivation methods into climate-smart, modern farming techniques. The eligible paddy farmers cultivating up to 0.5 ha of land will receive 50 kg urea fertiliser and necessary tools to enhance efficiency of fertiliser use. 3,820 tonnes of urea fertiliser procured by the programme were already handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture to be distributed among selected smallholder paddy farmers and paddy seed farmers. Paddy seed farmers supported through the programme will also receive locally produced, high quality paddy seeds alongside material support such as parachute trays to improve efficiency and profitability of cultivation methods. Furthermore, all recipients will be enrolled in farmer-field schools to improve knowledge sharing on modern techniques such as the Integrated Plant Nutrient Management (IPNM) strategy to boost efficiency and reduce dependency on the use of chemical fertiliser. Minister Amaraweera expressed his appreciation to the FAO and the EU for the implementation of a holistic programme to improvie sustainability of Sri Lanka’s paddy sector and said, “Our paddy farmers underwent significant challenges over the past few years. This support we received from FAO and the EU is a testament to their perseverance during the tough times, for which we are thankful. These inputs and knowledge sharing will no doubt elevate the quality of rice production and the livelihoods of Sri Lankan paddy farmers.” “This programme marks an important milestone in FAO’s work in Sri Lanka over the past year – the shift back into development from the emergency response. We are grateful for the support we have received from the EU to implement this programme, which aims to address some of the longstanding concerns in the local paddy sector, to reach better production, leading to better nutrition, a better environment and improve food security for all Sri Lankans,” FAO Representative in Sri Lanka, Sharan said.  The EU and FAO will continue to work closely with the Government of Sri Lanka and key partners to support the recovery of the agriculture sector while building resilience and sustainability into the sector to increase yield and profit for smallholder farmers as the sector recovers."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

She claimed, however, Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe submitted the Cabinet Paper requesting to file the case in Singapore to obtain the compensation claims. “The proposal to file a case in Singapore was submitted by Minister of Justice, and I and the other stakeholders were completely opposed to it,” she said. She added that after receiving the first two payments, for cleaning the beach, in US dollars, she rejected the P&I Club’s offer to pay the third instalment for Beach Cleaning Compensation in LKR at the height of the nation’s economic crisis. She argued that the P&I club had attempted to take advantage by having the beach cleaning compensation settled in LKR, and she presented Minister Prasanna Ranatunga with a Cabinet memo demanding that the payment be made in US dollars, to which the Minister consented. She continued, “But that assertion is currently on hold.” She said she was forced to accept the LKR settlement despite the Cabinet’s approval to take the settlement in USD, but that decision has since been put on hold because if legal action is taken again on this matter the compensation for Beach Cleaning would further delay. She added that it would take only two to three days to identify the person or people, who took a USD 250 million bribe on the X-Pearl disaster compensation, as mentioned by the Minister of Justice. She advised against delaying as it would set a poor example for all the organisations working to obtain compensation from the vessel owner and the P&I club insurer, including the NARA, MEPA, expert committee Merchant Shipping, etc. She claimed that many had questioned whether MEPA was at fault, because the lawsuit, which was supposed to be filed before 23 September 2022, was actually filed on 23 January 2023. According to Lahandapura, MEPA and she fought against some of the judgments that interfered with their mission. Lahandapura claimed that MEPA and she had fought against some of the rulings that had prevented them from securing compensation for the X-Press Pearl disaster, but that the bribe allegations could cast a negative light on those institutions, who worked for the compensation and cause their operations to collapse if the claims were not proven but kept going. The declaration by the Minister of Justice, stated that he obtained information regarding the transfer of USD 250 million to a Sri Lankan’s foreign account as a bribe to obstruct the legal process related to the X-Press Pearl disaster. He then ordered the Police to begin an investigation into the matter. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The 4 million Euro (approximately  Rs 1.5 billion) initiative funded by the EU was initiated at an event held at the Bataatha Agro Technology park in Hambanthota under the auspices of Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera, EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Denis Chaibi and FAO Representative in Sri Lanka, Vimlendra Sharan. Implemented by FAO with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Mahaweli Authority, the programme targets 71,000 smallholder paddy farmers and 1,200 paddy seed farmers across seven districts including Polonnaruwa, Badulla, Ampara, Matale, Puttalam, Kurunegala and Hambantota Districts who were severely impacted by the recent-economic crisis. Speaking at the event, which saw the official start of the farmer field schools, EU Ambassador Chaibi said, “With this new action, we want to help farmers not only to grow more, but most importantly to grow better so that they can increase their production and incomes, but also protect the environment around them. We hope that together with FAO and the Government of Sri Lanka we can gradually promote a transition towards greener and climate-smart agriculture. Transition  that produces sufficient amount of food, while protecting the planet and its people.” The recipient farmers will receive material and technical support to transition from traditional cultivation methods into climate-smart, modern farming techniques. The eligible paddy farmers cultivating up to 0.5 ha of land will receive 50 kg urea fertiliser and necessary tools to enhance efficiency of fertiliser use. 3,820 tonnes of urea fertiliser procured by the programme were already handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture to be distributed among selected smallholder paddy farmers and paddy seed farmers. Paddy seed farmers supported through the programme will also receive locally produced, high quality paddy seeds alongside material support such as parachute trays to improve efficiency and profitability of cultivation methods. Furthermore, all recipients will be enrolled in farmer-field schools to improve knowledge sharing on modern techniques such as the Integrated Plant Nutrient Management (IPNM) strategy to boost efficiency and reduce dependency on the use of chemical fertiliser. Minister Amaraweera expressed his appreciation to the FAO and the EU for the implementation of a holistic programme to improvie sustainability of Sri Lanka’s paddy sector and said, “Our paddy farmers underwent significant challenges over the past few years. This support we received from FAO and the EU is a testament to their perseverance during the tough times, for which we are thankful. These inputs and knowledge sharing will no doubt elevate the quality of rice production and the livelihoods of Sri Lankan paddy farmers.” “This programme marks an important milestone in FAO’s work in Sri Lanka over the past year – the shift back into development from the emergency response. We are grateful for the support we have received from the EU to implement this programme, which aims to address some of the longstanding concerns in the local paddy sector, to reach better production, leading to better nutrition, a better environment and improve food security for all Sri Lankans,” FAO Representative in Sri Lanka, Sharan said.  The EU and FAO will continue to work closely with the Government of Sri Lanka and key partners to support the recovery of the agriculture sector while building resilience and sustainability into the sector to increase yield and profit for smallholder farmers as the sector recovers."

Dead children were among those exhumed, and police said they expected to find even more bodies. The shallow graves are in Shakahola forest, where 15 members of the Good News International Church were rescued last week. Preacher Paul Mackenzie Nthenge is in custody, pending a court appearance. State broadcaster KBC described him as a ‘cult leader’, and reported that 58 graves have so far been identified. One of the graves is believed to contain the bodies of five members of the same family – three children and their parents. Mackenzie has denied wrongdoing, but has been refused bail. He insists that he shut down his church in 2019. He allegedly told followers to starve themselves in order to ‘meet Jesus’. The Kenyan daily The Standard said pathologists will take DNA samples and conduct tests to determine whether the victims died of starvation. Police arrested Mackenzie on 15 April after finding the bodies of four people suspected of having starved themselves to death. Victor Kaudo of the Malindi Social Justice Centre told Citizen TV “when we are in this forest and come to an area where we see a big and tall cross, we know that means more than five people are buried there”. The preacher allegedly named three villages Nazareth, Bethlehem and Judea and baptised followers in ponds before telling them to fast, The Standard reports. Kenya is a religious country and there have been previous cases of people being lured into dangerous, unregulated churches or cults. (BBC)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The Gazette notification came into effect yesterday (20). Accordingly, the MRP of a kilo of white eggs is Rs 880, while the MRP of a single white egg is Rs 44.  The MRP of a kilo of brown eggs is Rs 920 and the MRP of a single brown egg is Rs 46. The CAA has also ordered that no Manufacturer, Producer, Supplier, Distributor or Trader shall sell, supply, expose or offer for sale, or display for sale the item listed below, exceeding the Maximum Retail Price. Earlier this week, the All Ceylon Egg Producers’ Association (ACEPA) Chairman Sarath Ratnayake said it would be difficult to reduce the price of local eggs this week, but had come to a decision to sell a local egg below Rs 50. He said when striving to reduce the price of eggs in the domestic market several factors would need to be considered at length and insisted that they cannot opt for ad-hoc decisions which could worsen the plight of local traders who make a living through the industry. “As a result of extreme hot weather these days, the hens are dying. Some farmers have sold their hens for meat as well,” he said.  Ratnayake noted that most traders have taken the decision to opt out of the trade due to the recent decision taken by the Government to import eggs from India. He added that if the CAA does not arbitrarily interfere with the egg manufacturers, his Association would be able to reduce the local egg price by a sizeable amount by 1 May. However, the All Ceylon Egg Producers’ Association (ACEPA) stressed that it is impossible to sell eggs according to prices gazette by the CAA,  ACEPA Chairman Sarath Ratnayake said if an egg is 38g, 1kg of eggs will contain 28 eggs. So, the egg producers will receive only Rs 31 per egg, if 1kg of eggs is priced at Rs 880. If an egg is 50g, there would be 20 eggs per 1kg. If that happens, we have to wait for five months to earn profits, he said. Therefore, a kilo of eggs should be priced at least Rs 900, he said. Meanwhile, the shortage of eggs in the market still prevails, even ifthough the CAA sets a MRP for a kilo of eggs. Many super markets and shops said due to the confusion following the Gazette they did not order eggs. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

Immigration Director-General Datuk Ruslin Jusoh said the modus operandi of a group that trafficked Sri Lankan children to Europe was uncovered following the arrest of a local husband and wife couple, aged 37 and 26, respectively, on April 12 in Kuala Lumpur. “The syndicate would convince parents to bring the birth certificates of their children aged 12 to the Immigration Department office in the guise of making a passport. “However, the child brought to the counter would instead be one of a similar age from Sri Lanka and that child will be sent to get their photo taken and fingerprints recorded,” he said in a statement yesterday. He said the suspects, who led the syndicate, were also the “transporters” who would take the Sri Lankan children, who have successfully obtained their passports, to Europe. “Investigations are underway to trace and determine how many children have been involved and how long the syndicate had been in operation. “Based on preliminary investigations, the syndicate was paid between €30,000 and €50,000 (RM145,906 to RM243,177) for each child who got a passport and escorted to Europe,” Ruslin said The couple was busted after going to the Kuala Lumpur Immigration Department branch when they were attempting to get a passport. They were stopped after discrepancies were found during the application process and an officer proceeded to interview the child. The child failed to communicate in Bahasa Malaysia and had distinct facial differences from the suspects. The suspects were brought to the Kuala Lumpur Courthouse yesterday and would be held at the Kajang prison until May 11 for their case to be mentioned (The Star)"

The Acting Magistrate said the fundamental rights of citizens could be violated, via the issuance of injunctions by the Judiciary, willy-nilly, as sought by the Police and based on their imaginations. The Acting Magistrate made this remark, while dismissing a request made to him by the Chief Inspector of Negombo Police. Acting Magistrate de Silva opined that the Judiciary has no right whatsoever to infringe upon the fundamental rights enshrined in the Articles of the country’s Constitution. He said Constitution guarantees its citizens convene peacefully at rallies and air their views, either in support of the incumbent Government or to even express dissent. He pointed out that if injunctions were to be issued at the drop of a hat, to accommodate such frivolous requests by the Police, it would be a violation of fundamental rights of the people, guaranteed in the Constitution. He then mentioned that if anyone were to indulge in any activity that hinders public peace, then the Police could always act, according to Provisions contained in the Police Ordinance. Negombo Police submitted a detailed report to Court, stating that if the protest is allowed to be held today, it could disturb public peace and even lead to acts of violence afterwards, as it coincides with the fourth year since the Easter Sunday carnage took place. They added that the intended demonstration was planned to be organizsed by a religious organisation and that from information available to them, certain political parties and trade unions, were also set to support it, which could lead to a violent situation. The Police afterwards prayed the Court, to issue an injunction, based on Provisions contained in Section 106 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Taking the submissions into perusal, the Negombo Acting Magistrate, rejected the request by the Police. By Hansi Nanayakkara"

According to the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) Dr. Asela Gunawardena the acting Anaesthesiologists had been appointed to the Embilipitiya District General Hospital, Base Hospitals in Udugama and  Kamburupitiya, Kilinochchi District General Hospital, Dickoya General Hospital, and Mannar District General Hospital,. Emergency surgeries were halted at the Embilipitiya District General Hospital, for over two weeks, due to the shortage of anesthetists. The situation arose as the result of the Anesthetists serving at the hospitals vacating their posts to go in search of greener pastures. The anesthesiologist who was appointed temporarily to replace the vacated post also is said to have left for overseas training. (DJ)"

He added however that the final decision will be taken at the Cabinet meeting due to be held next week.  “As the two government-owned fertiliser companies are working to provide fertiliser at the lowest price, competition has arisen in the market regarding the sale of chemical fertiliser. The price of a bundle of urea, which was Rs 42,000 last Yala season, in 2022, has been reduced toRs. 11,000,” he said. He added that the said companies have observed that the prices of TSP and MOP will also decrease further. “In the past, there were only six private companies that imported and distributed fertiliser, whereas currently, the number of fertiliser companies, importing and distributing it has increased to 12 and the advantage of this competition should be provided to farmers,” he said.

AHP President Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (19) explained that whatever the answer his fans craved to the question of whether this veteran actor would be able to regain his former strength, the medical answer would be “no.” He said although individuals could harbour theistic, miraculous and strange beliefs, medical science must prevail inside a hospital. Therefore, advice should be sought medically in this regard. “What some people believe to be the actor’s life is dependent on science and technical equipment,” he said. “The most important factor was that the ventilator which has been allocated for him as a patient for a lengthy period may have been used to save many more lives. Instead, those lives have been put at risk to save the life of the veteran actor. It would be worthwhile if his life could be saved. But, no one has the right to offer another life for that,” Kumudesh said. He added that all those who wanted to safeguard the veteran actor’s life could help by making this facility artificially at his home or in a special place. “Or else, if hearts soften the way they do for the veteran actor such a facility could be built for those who are put at risk by this prolonged wait for the patient on the ventilator to return to normal,” he added.

Addressing the media, yesterday (19) he said while he and likeminded people clamored for the well-being of the people and to change the system, some people today are clamoring, because they are worried, they will no longer be able to engage in petty politics that deceive the people. Nanayakkara said people who are now shouting all over the country and the world are people who are upset because the country has been revived from the abysmal situation which it was a few months back. “But why are some people worried now? Foreign reserves had fallen below USD 50 million. We only had reserves in gold. As of today, we have been able to increase the foreign reserves to USD 2.3 billion. The expatriate workers as well as our exporters helped to increase the foreign reserves. Even though expatriate workers were told by some not to send money, expatriate workers sent USD 580 million last month alone. During these months, billions in money was sent to the country. People were able to buy medicine. The children of our country were able to go back to school. After three years, we were able to celebrate the New Year. People went back to villages. Tourists came back to Sri Lanka. The New Year celebrations started again. People withdrew Rs 45 billion from the Bank of Ceylon ATM’s alone during the Avurudu week,” he claimed. Nanayakkara said the country has now been saved from bankruptcy. “We got enough fuel for the New Year. On 2 January, diesel was reduced by Rs 15 and kerosene by Rs 10. On March 29, petrol was reduced by Rs 60, diesel by Rs 80 and kerosene by Rs 10 again. The price of fuel was reduced to match the price of fuel in the world market. Gas price was reduced by Rs 1000. We got assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The investors have now started coming to the country again. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Paris Club are discussing how to help Sri Lanka. Our teams are negotiating with the World Bank team to get a lot of concessions. Development projects are being started in our country,” he said. He added that the President Ranil Wickremesinghe is changing the country by putting aside party politics. “Taxes are taken from those who should be taxed. Taxes are levied only on those who earn more than Rs 100,000. Only a few people are taxed in this country. In spite of that, they say that we are responsible for losing billions to the country by stopping work at the port. They are trying to destabilise the country. Will the wages of those who went on street protests, be cut?  Slogans disappear when the country is normalised. When all these things are restored, a situation has been created where it is impossible to shout on the streets,” he added. He further claimed that some parties, when schools are opened and education is restored, are trying to create unrest in the country by stopping the evaluation of examination answer scripts. They are trying to create unrest within universities. They are trying to see whether it is possible to create youth unrest like in 88-89. They are always trying to spread hatred and unrest.

Ceylon Today inquired as to what the debt restructuring for Sri Lanka’s creditors entails and what options are available to them, to which Srinivasan said the decision on how the restructuring happens in terms of providing debt relief, that’s something which varies. “It has been negotiated between Sri Lanka and its creditors. Now, it could take the form of principle haircuts, an extension of maturity and interest rate reduction. So, what form it takes has been negotiated between Sri Lanka and its creditors, and we don’t get involved in that.” On debt relief, he said, “I think the way we have in the programme right now, again, the targets we have in the programme are aimed at restoring debt sustainability and balance of payment pressures even after the programme expires.

Sirisena said this when visiting the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy yesterday (19). Responding to a journalist on Cardinal Ranjith’s recent statement that strict legal action must be taken against Sirisena if the latter fails to pay compensation to Easter Sunday victims, the former President said Cardinal Ranjith is not the Chief Justice and only the Court can decide on such action. When queried whether he would contest the next Presidential Election, Sirisena said he is not aware which election will come first and a decision must be taken on elections by the Election Commission (EC). “We will accept the EC’s decisions on elections,” he added.

The Committee met under the aegis of the Chief Incumbent of Sri Pada, Ven. Bengamuwe Dhammadinna Thera, at the Ratnapura District Secretariat. Airing his views on the occasion, Governor of Sabaragamuwa Province Tikiri Kobbekaduwa said due to devotees trekking the Sri Pada Holy Site during the off season many issues have cropped up. He remarked that certain youths had shown a tendency to trek the Sri Pada Site to exhibit their heroism and bravery during the off-season. Ven. Bengamuwe Dhammadinna Thera mentioned that the Sri Pada season has    been officially sanctioned annually, from the dawn of the Unduwap Poya Day in December and ending with the Vesak Poya Day in May. He added that the period from May up to December has been designated as the off season for trekking the Sacred Site. Ven. Thera said as the weather conditions are unsuitable for devotees to visit the sacred site, the period from May to December has been classified as the off season during the past few decades. He further observed that many facilities for devotees such as electricity, water, public security, medical services and food supply is in short supply during the off season. Ven.

Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe yesterday (19) said however that emergency surgeries were being carried out using another theatre. However, routine surgeries have been halted while they were to tentatively recommence next week. He called for a departmental inquiry into the issue while noting that investigations should be conducted to assess as to whether the infection was being caused by a drug or an instrument being used. Dr. Wijesinghe said the findings of the investigation should be revealed to the public or else it would have a severe impact on its trust in the surgical procedure at the National Eye Hospital (NEH), Colombo. He said the Health Ministry and the Department of Health should also ensure that such incidents do not recur. If the issue is due to a medicinal drug that is being used then measures should be taken to withdraw that particular batch from State hospitals, he said. He further said it was one reason that the country needed a National Pharmaceutical Quality Control Laboratory (NPQCL).    Meanwhile, the President of the Association of Health Professionals (AHP) said operations have been allegedly halted indefinitely at the National Eye Hospital. He lamented that with no starting date for the halted surgeries there is no one to be held accountable for the patients awaiting eye surgery. “What is the need for a Health Ministry if this was the attitude,” Ravi Kumudesh queried. He added that the closure of State-run hospitals, allowing wards to shut down, turning away patients without medicine, and asking them to proceed as they can without carrying out their medical tests in the free health service, has become an unusual situation that is common in State hospitals. He said patients had been informed that surgeries will not be performed at the NEH since 19 April while during the past number of weeks, not even 50 per cent of the surgeries that should have been performed were done. He alleged that certain phases of surgeries have been pushed to the private sector while the remaining surgeries have been put on the waiting list. “Presently all surgeries have been suspended, placing patients’ lives at stake,” Kumudesh lamented, demanding as to where those who had shed crocodile tears for patients during health strikes are at present. He warned that the waiting list may even exceed the life of patients on it if no measures are taken to urgently rectify this situation and recommence eye surgeries.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

AHP President Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (19) explained that whatever the answer his fans craved to the question of whether this veteran actor would be able to regain his former strength, the medical answer would be “no.” He said although individuals could harbour theistic, miraculous and strange beliefs, medical science must prevail inside a hospital. Therefore, advice should be sought medically in this regard. “What some people believe to be the actor’s life is dependent on science and technical equipment,” he said. “The most important factor was that the ventilator which has been allocated for him as a patient for a lengthy period may have been used to save many more lives. Instead, those lives have been put at risk to save the life of the veteran actor. It would be worthwhile if his life could be saved. But, no one has the right to offer another life for that,” Kumudesh said. He added that all those who wanted to safeguard the veteran actor’s life could help by making this facility artificially at his home or in a special place. “Or else, if hearts soften the way they do for the veteran actor such a facility could be built for those who are put at risk by this prolonged wait for the patient on the ventilator to return to normal,” he added.

Her mother, LaTonya Allen, had also heard the rumours. She said that she turned on the lights, went to the DJ booth, and asked whoever had a firearm to leave the party. But when no-one spoke up, she turned the lights back off. The gunfire erupted shortly after. “All of a sudden you hear gunshots and you just see everybody running towards the door and people falling and screaming,” Alexis told the BBC.

Alexis said she hid behind another building in case the attacker was still on the loose. When she eventually went back inside, she discovered that her brother had been shot. He had lost a lot of blood. She stayed with him as he drifted in and out of consciousness. He was unable to talk, though he opened his eyes and raised his eyebrows as she cradled him in her arms. “The last thing I told him was to stay strong,” she said.

But the Minister lamented it has been difficult to find workers with the necessary skills to meet this job demand. The Minister said, to secure these job opportunities, the necessary skilled workers should be trained, and that an agreement will be signed with the Vocational Training Authority to provide vocational training for youth aimed at foreign employment. The Minister was speaking on the occasion of signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment and the Vocational Training Authority yesterday morning (18) to provide vocational training for youth aimed at foreign employment. Under the SLBFE Act, which functions under the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment, there is an opportunity to train workers targeting foreign jobs. But training is not our main task. The main task of this institution is to regulate the field of foreign employment, Nanayakkara said. “Also, the welfare of expatriate workers and their family members becomes a major responsibility of this institution. The primary responsibility for training workers for employment is assigned to the Ministry of Education and to the Ministry of Vocational Training. So we took a decision to leave such matters in the hands of the vocational training institutes in the public sector and the private vocational training institutes recognised by the Government,” he added. “It will be implemented as a policy decision. We are paying more attention to the welfare and protection of expatriate workers and their families.” Acting Chairman of SLBFE, Saminda Jayasekara and Chairman of Sri Lanka Vocational Training Authority, Air Vice Marshal (Retd) Prasanna Ranasinghe signed the agreement on behalf of their respective institutions. Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha and State Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion Jagath Pushpakumara were also present on this occasion. According to SLBFE, there are caregiver jobs in Japan and Europe, Hospitality industry jobs in England, Canada, and Australia, and Construction industry jobs in the Middle East. Also, an agreement for a vocational training programme aimed at foreign employment is in the pipeline."

In managing the electricity supply to the entire country with given resources, one of the major challenges faced by CEB is to supply electricity around the clock to the southern part of the island in the dry season, owing to the lack of generation in the Southern region and constraints in the transmission network.  CEB experienced this issue in yesteryears and the remedies adopted were acquiring supplementary power for the Southern region and expediting the construction of new transmission lines. In 2023, the same issue cropped up again and while action was taken to acquire supplementary power and since it takes a considerable period of time to complete a competitive tender process to procure supplementary power, the Power and Energy Minister together with the CEB top management headed by the CEB General Manager decided on 21 April to make use of CEB-owned 1 MW x 30 Nos diesel generators installed at Kolonnawa and Thulhiriya GSS by shifting them to the Southern part of the island to address the power supply challenges faced in the South. The technical feasibility dictated the most suitable location for these 30 generators of 30 MW capacity is Hambantota Grid Substation, enabling it to operate all 30 generators at one location. The decision to shift the 30 generators to Hambantota Grid Substation has been implemented and ultimately, it materialised on 31 March. All work from planning to commissioning was done by CEB staff within a short time span of 33 days demonstrating excellent professionalism, from the top engineers to field technical employees. All worked together to carry out this assignment. Vigilant leadership, exemplary delegation, dedicated supervision and professional execution are important traits CEB staff exhibited during this exercise under the leadership of the CEB General Manager. This is a golden example, where CEB demonstrated its capability and capacity successfully on challenging engineering executions."

Addressing the media on Monday (17) SJB MP Tissa Attanayake demanded an investigation, by the Ministry of Defence, to determine the accuracy of the rumour. “The forex crisis is still there in our country. The only thing people feel that the situation is under control is because we are not paying our debts. Despite the dollar crisis, there is a rumour that Israel has signed a USD 55 million contract to repair several Kfir aircraft in the possession of the Sri Lanka Air Force. If this is true, it is unnecessary move at a critical juncture like this. The priority should not be the allocating of USD 55 million to repair Kfir aircraft, when there are serious issues such as food and medicine shortages in the country,” he said.

The state-of-the-art Airbus A320neo and A321neo aircraft joined the national carrier post-2017. The A320neo can carry 150 passengers while the A321neo can accommodate 188 passengers. The registrations of these aircraft are 4R-ANA, 4R-ANB, 4R-AND, 4R-ANE, and 4R-ANF.  Chairman of SriLankan Airlines Independent Workers’ Union Janaka Wijayapathirathna told the media that the root cause of this issue is operating six different aircraft types, which makes sourcing spares a nightmare. “If the airline followed a proper business plan, it won’t have to face such an unfortunate situation. Even major players like Emirates operate only two to three aircraft types,” he said. Wijayapathirathna added that the national airline is facing huge losses as a result of grounding aircraft. “We are compelled to cut back on profitable flights due to a shortage of aircraft. Compounding the issue, the lease payment on these grounded aircraft amounts to USD 350,000 to USD 400,000.” The union leader urged the Government to draw up a proper business plan for the national carrier to save it from rack and ruin. “There is an ongoing debate about privatising the airline, but if this situation continues there won’t be an airline left to privatise,” he stressed.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Speaker on 4 April announced to the House that the Supreme Court has determined that none of the provisions in the Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution. He said the Court has determined that the Bill can be passed by a simple majority in Parliament, subject to the amendments mentioned in the determination. The Speaker’s announcement sparked controversy as several including Gammanpila, alleged that the Speaker failed to announce the Supreme Court determination on the Bill correctly to the House. In this backdrop, Gammanpila, in a letter to the Speaker, said the determination, which is 54-pages-long, clearly said certain provisions of the Bill have to be passed with two-third-majority/referendum. The Supreme Court has proposed 80 amendments to the Bill. According to my point of view this Bill is the most erroneous one among the laws presented to Parliament in recent history, he stressed. The Speaker not communicating this determination clearly to Parliament has caused a huge damage to the goodwill of the Supreme Court. Not only that, it is a violation of Parliamentary Privileges of the MPs who challenged the Bill in Supreme Court as well, he alleged. “After you (the Speaker) made the announcement on 4 April, I, as an MP who petitioned against the Bill, tried several times to contact you to request it be corrected. Since you were abroad I contacted your Coordinating Secretary Dr. Chameera Abeywardena. However, later your Media Secretary Indunil Abeywardena had issued a press release alleging that I am trying to deceive the country for narrow political gains.

He said there is a high possibility that toque monkeys are likely to be exported to China for testing laboratories, adding that in the recent past, there has been a shortage of test animals for laboratories in certain countries including China. “The proposal is to export monkeys for zoos but there are only approximately 18 such facilities in China and if Sri Lanka is to export 100,000 toque monkeys, that amounts to  at least over 5,000 monkeys per facility,” he said adding thereby that it sounds illogical. Withanage emphasised that a huge sum of money will have to be incurred to capture 100,000 monkeys, while questioning as to why such sum of money cannot be used to compensate for crop damage by animals. “The issue of crop damage requires a long-term solution, especially in terms of putting an end to clearing of forests, resulting in destruction of food sources for animals, including monkeys due to which they tend to go to villages in search of food, often resulting in such damage,” he said. Withanage further noted that there has also been misinformation as to the population of monkeys in Sri Lanka, adding that although it is stated that there are over three million monkeys, no assessment has been done in this regard.

Sri Lanka Navy intercepted a fishing trawler carrying over 179 kg of heroin, with street value of over Rs 3.5 billion, along with six suspects in southern seas on 15 April.  The Navy revealed that they had seized drugs with a gross street value of over Rs 4.9 billion, during operations mounted in 2023, along with the latest haul. The operation was carried out by the Sri Lanka Coast Guard Ship ‘Samudraraksha’ and the Commander of the Navy Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera was present when the suspects and the narcotics were brought to the Galle Harbour.

Addressing the media, at the Bishop’s House in Colombo yesterday (17), Colombo Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith said this would call upon the leaders of the country to render justice to the victims of the Easter attack and strengthen the hands of freedom and justice in the island. He said the Sri Lankan Catholic Community would continue to pressure the government and authorities until such time that the leaders understood and gave justice for 2019 Easter Sunday victims. Cardinal Ranjith invited all to gather on both sides along Colombo-Negombo main road starting from St. Anthony’s Kochchikade to Katuwapitiya, St Sebastian’s peacefully at 8.30 a.m. without disturbing the traffic. He also called upon those gathered to maintain two minutes of silence at 8:45 a.m. and continue to remain in that line till 9.00 a.m.  Those in offices and factories could also pay their respects to the bomb victims by maintaining the two minutes silence at 8.45 a.m.  Fielding questions Cardinal Ranjith said there were over 300 cases filed in Colombo and Negombo Courts by victims and their relatives demanding compensation.  “None of the governments has paid attention to the Catholic Church’s call for justice for the victims who died in the Churches and the five star hotels. Whatever action has been taken has been on its own volition and those of the organisations and institutions which collaborate with the Church of Sri Lanka,” he said noting that several persons had been given punishment through Court for several fundamental rights cases filed by individuals and organisations collaborating with the Church.  Delaying of justice also prompted the local Catholic community to take its woe to the international community.  He said that Pope Francis was also aware of endeavours made by the Sri Lankan Catholic community to seek justice. “We have not given up our efforts to find the truth behind the attacks and would continue to be committed to that cause,” the head of Sri Lanka’s Catholic Church said. Recalling the statement made by former Attorney General who had called it the most cruel and inhuman attacks to have taken place in the most recent times, he said that the former Attorney General had noted that the attacks had been a part of a “grand conspiracy”. It is clear to us and many others that these attacks were a plot organised in order to gain political power. Presidents as well as politicians who ruled this country since 2019 as well as the incumbent President and some corrupt State officials have been and are a part of an attempt to hide the truth behind the attacks in order to protect the perpetrators.  The country is fast going towards an unacceptable state where the impression is that all decisions and actions are taken by one person. As the Prime Minister the incumbent President took action to clip the wings of the President of the ‘good governance government.’ However, now after becoming the President he is now introducing laws to give him that power, he alleged. Claiming that this was highly unacceptable in a democratic country, Cardinal Ranjith said that there needs to be an election to ensure that the voice of the people was heard. “We obtain power to serve the people and to give justice and not to merely retain that power and quash their voices,” he said.

He said when striving to reduce the price of eggs in the domestic market several factors would need to be considered at length and insisted that they cannot opt for ad-hoc decisions which could worsen the plight of local traders who make a living through the industry. “As a result of extreme hot weather these days, the hens are dying. Some farmers have sold their hens for meat as well,” he said.  Ratnayake noted that most traders have taken the decision to opt out of the trade due to the recent decision taken by the Government to import eggs from India.

Amaraweera noted that although a request has been made from China for toque monkeys from Sri Lanka, no final decision has been taken in this connection. He said a Chinese company that handles several private zoological gardens had made a request to provide monkeys from Sri Lanka for their zoos, adding however that a committee comprising representatives from the Department of Wildlife Conservation, Department of Zoological Gardens, Attorney General’s Department, Ministry of Agriculture and Department of Agriculture will be appointed to inspect the relevant request.  “Toque monkeys will only be exported to China based on the the recommendation of the sub committee appointed by the Cabinet. If the committee decides otherwise, then this matter will be put to an end,” he said. While stating that there has been certain misunderstandings in this regard, he noted  that those who oppose this proposal have not provided alternatives to tackle crop damage caused by Toque monkeys and thereby that it has to be looked at with an open mind.

He said when striving to reduce the price of eggs in the domestic market several factors would need to be considered at length and insisted that they cannot opt for ad-hoc decisions which could worsen the plight of local traders who make a living through the industry. “As a result of extreme hot weather these days, the hens are dying. Some farmers have sold their hens for meat as well,” he said.  Ratnayake noted that most traders have taken the decision to opt out of the trade due to the recent decision taken by the Government to import eggs from India.

Speaking at a media briefing in Kandy yesterday (16), the minister said while there are a few political hypocrites who undermine the country’s stabilisation process, the majority of people support the country’s economic revival. He added that the Government has given trade unions complete freedom. “However, any Government is responsible for defeating conspiracies to overthrow it by promoting certain political agendas through trade unions. These persons are now creating false fear with regard to the Anti-Terrorism Bill. Every group in this country is divided when various Constitutional amendments are proposed.

The draft Anti-Terrorism Act categorically fails on every human rights benchmark. If the Biden administration values the rights of the Sri Lankan people, they need to send a clear message to the President, Nash said in a statement. The Sri Lankan Government has been using the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to detain and torture critics and minorities for over four decades. International condemnation of the PTA led the government of Sri Lanka to commit to repealing the law. The ATA, published on March 22 is the replacement legislation the government has proposed after another Bill brought in 2018 was shelved after widespread condemnation.  “If the administration and Congress are silent as this draft law advances, they will allow the Sri Lankan government to further cement its ability to suppress dissent,” said Nash.  “The proposed legislation is an insult to civil society in Sri Lanka, who have advocated for decades for legal reforms to protect human rights. This is far from a good faith effort on the part of the Sri Lankan authorities to improve or replace a bad law – it is an effort to shore up the government’s ability to target and silence their critics,” she added. The AI South Asia Researcher Thyagi Ruwanpathirana said, “The drafters of the ATA have not taken into account the benchmarks laid out by UN experts in order to come up with a counter-terror law that would start to bring the legislation in line with international law. The offences in the anti-terror Bill remain broad, vague, and subjective. They are ripe for abuse. Even offences under Sri Lanka’s ICCPR Act are now made terror offences.”  “It’s clear after the mass protests last year, the State has become even more willing to misuse counter terrorism offences in order to target activists. This is reflected in new offences created that seek to classify acts of civil disobedience as terror offences.” The new Bill also retains PTA provisions to enable prolonged detention (up to one year without charge). The High Court can extend this period at the request of the Attorney General. It provides the Police with access to those who are already indicted and in judicial remand and enables suspects to be removed from remand custody for the purpose of conducting further investigations under the authority of an order made by a Magistrate.  “This provision is dangerous and facilitates torture, especially in a context that is already rife with allegations of torture in custody,” added Ruwanpathirana.  The Bill empowers the military to carry out arrests without warrants. It retains unchecked powers of the executive, including proscribing persons and organisations without judicial oversight. Penalties include the death penalty, which AI strongly opposes, Ruwanpathirana said."

The ATA, published on March 22 is the replacement legislation the government has proposed after another Bill brought in 2018 was shelved after widespread condemnation.  “If the administration and Congress are silent as this draft law advances, they will allow the Sri Lankan government to further cement its ability to suppress dissent,” said Nash.  “The proposed legislation is an insult to civil society in Sri Lanka, who have advocated for decades for legal reforms to protect human rights. This is far from a good faith effort on the part of the Sri Lankan authorities to improve or replace a bad law – it is an effort to shore up the government’s ability to target and silence their critics,” she added. The AI South Asia Researcher Thyagi Ruwanpathirana said, “The drafters of the ATA have not taken into account the benchmarks laid out by UN experts in order to come up with a counter-terror law that would start to bring the legislation in line with international law. The offences in the anti-terror Bill remain broad, vague, and subjective. They are ripe for abuse. Even offences under Sri Lanka’s ICCPR Act are now made terror offences.”  “It’s clear after the mass protests last year, the State has become even more willing to misuse counter terrorism offences in order to target activists. This is reflected in new offences created that seek to classify acts of civil disobedience as terror offences.” The new Bill also retains PTA provisions to enable prolonged detention (up to one year without charge). The High Court can extend this period at the request of the Attorney General. It provides the Police with access to those who are already indicted and in judicial remand and enables suspects to be removed from remand custody for the purpose of conducting further investigations under the authority of an order made by a Magistrate.  “This provision is dangerous and facilitates torture, especially in a context that is already rife with allegations of torture in custody,” added Ruwanpathirana.  The Bill empowers the military to carry out arrests without warrants. It retains unchecked powers of the executive, including proscribing persons and organisations without judicial oversight. Penalties include the death penalty, which AI strongly opposes, Ruwanpathirana said."

In a statement, the SLPI said it is of the opinion that the Anti-Terrorism Bill has several controversial elements that are not conducive for the media community. The proposed Bill consists of an overbroad and vague definition of ‘acts of terrorism’ that can be interpreted in a manner which curtails the freedom of expression. “The broad powers vested within the proposed Bill enables the criminalisation of speech that is likely to be understood as an encouragement or inducement to commit or prepare for terrorism, with the burden of proof on the defendant to show that was not their intention,” the statement said. These offences also apply to those who publish, distribute, sell, or transmit publications that could be interpreted as materials supporting acts of terrorism.  According to the Bill, confidential information could be any information having an ‘adverse impact’ on ‘national security/defence’ which includes ‘any information not in the public domain’. “Therefore, the broad and vague classification of ‘confidential information’ could place media personnel in a precarious position in the due course of executing their duties, as many offences which fall under the criminal law could now be reframed as ‘terrorist offences’. It is evident that the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights of citizens, in terms of freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly and association, and freedom to dissent are threatened through the proposed ATA. While the SLPI understands the need to amend the PTA, it also endorses caution in making amendments that could undermine democracy and good governance.”"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The launch of Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring negotiation process will take place today (13) in Washington, DC. India’s Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, who is currently in Washington DC, informed the IMF that she will today (13), together with a senior official from the French Finance Ministry, announce the beginning of Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring negotiations. Despite the IMF agreement to approve the bailout package, the debt restructuring with Sri Lanka’s international creditors has not yet taken place. China, India and Japan, the main creditors, had to agree to a process of debt restructuring that would assist in receiving the bailout loan. While State Minister Shehan Semansinghe and CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe will represent Sri Lanka, Japan will be represented by Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki,  and Vice Minister of Finance Masato Kanda along with India’s Sitharaman. France’s Director General of the Treasury, Emmanuel Moulin will also be present.

IMF Managing Directer Kristalina Georgieva on 7 April said that China had been helpful in reaching a debt relief deal for Chad and also Sri Lanka, a middle-income country that was not eligible for help under the G20 framework, and she encouraged China to show progress in other cases. Semasinghe tweeted yesterday (12) about this new initiative, stating, “In my meeting with IMF Managing Director Krisalina Georgieva, have expressed our gratitude for giving leadership to support Sri Lanka in overcoming the difficulties faced during the economic crisis.” We reiterated our commitment to finishing the IMF programme while continuing to implement it. He also emphasised Sri Lanka’s ambitious reform plan to achieve debt sustainability and economic stability and reaffirmed its commitment to rebuild it as a thriving country with the help and trust of its foreign partners, drawing on the lessons learned from the crisis. When Sri Lanka defaulted its payment to its creditors it was India that informed the IMF that Sri Lanka should receive an IMF bailout. She and the US Ambassador of Sri Lanka Julie Chung  said they would back the process for Sri Lanka, as it is in desperate need of financial assistance. Georgieva also tweeted that she had met the Central Bank Governor Weerasinghe and the Sri Lanka delegation and that the  IMF will to support at this difficult time. “Now it is important for everyone to come together to do their part to overcome the crisis,” she tweeted. Also, the World Bank, too, reiterated its support for Sri Lanka to stabilise its economy, step up social protection and revive growth.    The bailout package for Sri Lanka was agreed to as a 48-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme.

Issuing a special statement yesterday (12), FUTA said the decision was made after the Minister of Education promised to address FUTA’s concerns. The FUTA also emphasised that the Government’s progress will be continuously monitored and the strike will resume if the promises are not fulfilled within a reasonable time frame. At the meeting, the FUTA discussed recent correspondence with the Chairman of the University Grants Commission and the Minister of Education and decided that according to these documents, sufficient action has not been taken to address FUTA’s primary concerns. It was decided that until a satisfactory conclusion is reached, the decision on the participation of university academics in the G.C.E. Advanced Level evaluation will be deferred. FUTA recognises the Minister of Education’s initial dedication, but believes that the support of other government officials is needed to successfully implement the proposed changes, FUTA said. Without a concrete plan outlining when the Government plans to fulfil its promises, FUTA is hesitant to place its faith in the Government. The failure of the Government to meet the demands of FUTA has had far-reaching effects on the quality of education, and FUTA holds the Government solely responsible, the statement said.  “The Government’s response to the demands of FUTA and PTUA, as well as the Government’s treatment of unions, is both undemocratic. To find a better solution, FUTA wants the Government to speak to both FUTA and PTUA. Workers should be allowed to organise into unions and bargain collectively, and the Government should honour these rights. The Government should address the concerns of FUTA and PTUA and find a solution that benefits society as a whole. As FUTA, we have informed the Government that we will no longer tolerate its failure to address the legitimate demands of the university academics, which has led to concerns including life threats to FUTA leaders. We, at FUTA, strongly disapprove of such conduct and pledge to take any and all measures necessary to stop it in the future. We condemn the threatening behaviour. We advocate for a space where all people can feel comfortable sharing their ideas without fear of retaliation. We call on every Sri Lankan to stand with us in defending these ideals and fostering an atmosphere of mutual regard and tolerance,” the statement said."

SLTB Deputy General Manager Panduka Swarnahansa said the schedule of the arrangements for the bus services had been made since 8 April. Swarnahansa said that a number (011 232 80 81) has been announced for people to get information about buses. “It was reported that more people have been arriving at the Colombo Central Bus Stand yesterday (12). So, we have assigned additional buses to provide transport facilities for them,” he said. “We expect more people to use the central bus stand for their travels this afternoon and evening. Therefore, the SLTB has decided to assign more than 250 additional buses for long-distance services,” Swarnahansa said. He added that certain buses have been recalled from remote depots to be assigned for the long-distance services. Meanwhile, the Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association (LPBOA) also said additional private buses will be assigned during the New Year season following the requirements of the National Transport Commission (NTC) and the Road Passenger Transport Authority (RPTA). Addressing the media, yesterday (12) LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijerathne said limited additional bus services were operated on 11 April and more additional buses will be deployed to operate this afternoon and tonight. “Fifty per cent of the buses will operate, today (13), including short and long-distance services. There will be fewer bus services scheduled to operate on 14 April as the conductors and drivers too need to celebrate the New Year. The bus conductors and drivers who do not celebrate the New Year can carry on with their duties,” he said. Another 25% of buses are scheduled to operate on 15 April. However, long-distance bus services will resume only on 16 April. Wijeratne noted that LPBOA will provide additional buses following the request of the NTC and RPTA and have decided to charge an additional half of the fare as the buses have to return without passengers.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA.

The island nation aims to formally engage in debt negotiations with overseas creditors that include China, India and the Paris Club group of nations in May, after concluding a debt rework with holders of its domestic debt. “It’s up to the creditors to decide. We are happy if there is one platform, as it would be easier to discuss and share information,” Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe told Reuters. “Whether they are coming together or on a separate bilateral basis, we will have comparable debt treatment,” Weerasinghe said on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings in Washington. As a middle-income country, Sri Lanka is not able to apply for relief under the Group of 20 common framework for debt treatments, so how the Government can engage with creditors is not formally outlined. But is unclear whether a formal committee could secure a swift overhaul, as the platform has failed to speed up debt restructuring talks for common framework countries such as Zambia. Sri Lanka, caught in the worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948 triggered by a severe shortage of dollars, has seen steep inflation, a currency plunge and its economy slide into recession. It recently secured a USD 2.9 billion loan from the IMF, and also aims to get debt relief from over USD 12 billion owed to holders of sovereign bonds. When asked if the country would consider debt-for-nature swaps for all its overseas creditors, Weerasinghe said “those are useful and relevant financial instruments,” though the country’s main goal is to complete the debt rework process “as soon as possible.” “If creditors say that they would like to have those instruments, that it can be done within the timeline and do it fast, we are open,” the Central Bank Chief said. Sri Lanka’s foreign private creditors are considering swapping the country’s defaulted bonds for new securities where cash flow is linked to future economic growth. “Everyone can come and offer those kinds of solutions, and as we engage with them, we can see whether to include them or not.” The Central Bank Governor said additional financing through the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) to address climate change’s impact on the economy could be available, but only after the country recovers its debt sustainability under the Washington-based lender programme.

The minister said this during a discussion with Ambassadors and High Commissioners of Foreign Missions recently. Ali Sabry said, “The first area is to implement the 13th Amendment to obtain support from other parties in Parliament and reach a broad consensus to give all Sri Lankans the dignity and respect they deserve. The second area involves some executive actions, including speaking to all parties before amending the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to meet international standards.” The Minister thanked the Ambassadors and High Commissioners for attending the discussion “Thank you for your continuous support in staying informed about Sri Lanka’s progress and developments. I also make use of this opportunity to thank all Sri Lankan creditors and especially the international community represented by your beautiful countries, for supporting Sri Lanka during this very difficult period,” he further said.

The launch of Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring negotiation process will take place today (13) in Washington, DC. India’s Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, who is currently in Washington DC, informed the IMF that she will today (13), together with a senior official from the French Finance Ministry, announce the beginning of Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring negotiations. Despite the IMF agreement to approve the bailout package, the debt restructuring with Sri Lanka’s international creditors has not yet taken place. China, India and Japan, the main creditors, had to agree to a process of debt restructuring that would assist in receiving the bailout loan. While State Minister Shehan Semansinghe and CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe will represent Sri Lanka, Japan will be represented by Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki,  and Vice Minister of Finance Masato Kanda along with India’s Sitharaman. France’s Director General of the Treasury, Emmanuel Moulin will also be present. Japan, India, and France will hold a press briefing on the sidelines of the IMF – World Bank Spring Meetings to announce the launch and the three crediter countries have been closely working toward a coordinated debt restructuring plan for Sri Lanka. China, which was delaying its consent to debt restructuring finally agreed to the process. IMF Managing Directer Kristalina Georgieva on 7 April said that China had been helpful in reaching a debt relief deal for Chad and also Sri Lanka, a middle-income country that was not eligible for help under the G20 framework, and she encouraged China to show progress in other cases. Semasinghe tweeted yesterday (12) about this new initiative, stating, “In my meeting with IMF Managing Director Krisalina Georgieva, have expressed our gratitude for giving leadership to support Sri Lanka in overcoming the difficulties faced during the economic crisis.” We reiterated our commitment to finishing the IMF programme while continuing to implement it. He also emphasised Sri Lanka’s ambitious reform plan to achieve debt sustainability and economic stability and reaffirmed its commitment to rebuild it as a thriving country with the help and trust of its foreign partners, drawing on the lessons learned from the crisis. When Sri Lanka defaulted its payment to its creditors it was India that informed the IMF that Sri Lanka should receive an IMF bailout. She and the US Ambassador of Sri Lanka Julie Chung  said they would back the process for Sri Lanka, as it is in desperate need of financial assistance. Georgieva also tweeted that she had met the Central Bank Governor Weerasinghe and the Sri Lanka delegation and that the  IMF will to support at this difficult time. “Now it is important for everyone to come together to do their part to overcome the crisis,” she tweeted. Also, the World Bank, too, reiterated its support for Sri Lanka to stabilise its economy, step up social protection and revive growth.    The bailout package for Sri Lanka was agreed to as a 48-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme. The EFF programme will allow Sri Lanka to access financing of up to USD 7 billion from the IMF, international financial institutions and multilateral organisations.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

This was revealed by the President’s Chief of Staff and Senior Adviser on National Security, Sagala Ratnayake, during a discussion with Foreign Ambassadors and High Commissioners on Monday (10). As a result, the Government could not collect the expected revenue through excise duties. During the meeting, Ratnayake announced that the President has presented the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme to Parliament and it will be discussed from 25 April, while political parties will have to decide whether they will support their country or not. He emphasised the importance of a structural reform programme for economic recovery and sustainable growth, which includes not only financial and economic reforms, but also the reconciliation process, which is crucial for Sri Lanka’s progress. Ratnayake further said, “We started this tedious and ambitious programme of structural reform for economic recovery and sustainable growth. We were left with very little option to do that and it was a very committed effort that we started on. This programme is not limited purely to the fiscal and economic reforms; the fiscal reform in particular, also encompasses matters like the reconciliation process, which is the key to recovery for Sri Lankans and sustainable growth. “I won’t go into great detail on the IMF- EFF because it is a public document and I’m sure all of you have been through it. I just touched on the key areas. It is based on advancing revenue-based fiscal consolidation, which includes tax policy measures. Many of them have already been implemented, but there are others, such as the removal of para-tariffs, which I will touch on again later, that will be based on a structured process. There are others that we will have to review in September when we review the IMF programme. “The Budget Office is expected to be up and running by May 2023. There is a mandatory time period that allows for public consumption, after which it will be presented to Parliament and then referred to the Public Finance Committee, which in turn has to come back to Parliament. This is a process they have to follow, and they hope to finish it by the first Parliamentary week of April,” he said. “It is a very tight target. Once Parliament ratifies the decision of the Public Finance Committee, we hope to finish it by the first Parliamentary week of this month, which starts on 25 April. “In the third quarter of 2024, a new public debt management law will be introduced, covering various areas, including ones that are currently not covered by law. This includes processes such as providing Sovereign guarantees and so on,” Ratnayake elaborated."

The proposed Anti-Corruption Bill, which seeks to replace the Bribery Act (Chapter 26), the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994, and the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975, has been gazetted and is expected to be tabled in Parliament soon. This Bill was open for observations from different stakeholders including TISL and other civil society organisations, activists, and the public.    Speaking at a media briefing yesterday (11), TISL Deputy Executive Director Sankhitha Gunaratne said, “Specifically recognising sexual favours as a form of gratification, including private sector corruption, and corruption offences related to sporting events within its ambit, are important changes introduced in this Bill. The Bill also significantly increases fines that can be imposed for offences.” The media briefing was held at the TISL premises in Rajagiriya on 11 April, together with TISL Advocacy and Research Manager Janithrika Jayasundara, TISL Legal Officer – Community Sector Piumi Madushani and TISL Programme Officer – Communication Rifdhi Nawas. According to the proposed asset declaration system in the Bill, there will be a central authority (CIABOC – the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption) with which all the declarations of assets and liabilities will be filed. The asset declarations will be made publicly available through an electronic system, subject to the redaction of certain sensitive information. This electronic system will identify red flags regarding the illicit enrichment of the individuals to whom this law applies. The proposed law also requires the President to file their declaration of assets and liabilities, unlike the present law. However, TISL said there are two serious concerns in the proposed law. It seeks to override all other written law, which includes the Right to Information Act. The proposed law contains sections that require officials of the CIABOC to sign oaths of secrecy and therefore, the disclosure of information by CIABOC under the new law will only be possible with special permission from the Commission. As such, the proposed law promotes a culture of secrecy by making access to information from the CIABOC more difficult and thereby negates the objective to “enhance transparency in governance,” as stated in the Bill.  TISL also noted that Section 119 of the Bill, which refers to false allegations, appears to send a negative signal to citizens willing to come forward as informants and whistleblowers to report corruption. While the similar provision in the present law has not been misused targeting corruption fighters, this particular provision could become seriously counterproductive and dangerous in a context of a politically-influenced public service, or in an adverse environment of stifled civic space, democratic deficits, weak governance or kleptocracy. As an organisation that advocates for citizens’ freedom of expression, TISL believes that the proposed Bill should be more robust and progressive enough to encourage whistleblowers and citizens to come forward and report corruption without fear of repercussions, while discouraging the corrupt.    TISL further emphatically highlights that the law itself, on paper, cannot solve the plague of systemic corruption in Sri Lanka since the effectiveness of the law will entirely depend on its enforcement. For instance, the Bill provides for joint investigations and international cooperation, which will have no impact unless this is practically implemented. Under this Bill, the CIABOC is granted immense police powers, which provides adequate space for CIABOC to carry out its functions. TISL reiterates that the successful implementation of those functions depends on the level of independence the Commission is given, starting with the appointment of the Commission and the Director-General, the creation of an enabling environment where the commission and law enforcement officials are able to act without undue influence and intimidation, availability of resources including human resources, financial independence, and knowledge capacity. The mere passage of this Bill, despite its progressive portions, will not be able to address the issue of corruption in Sri Lanka until there is the political will to lead the country by example, a system change that includes a cultural shift where the people resist corruption even at the petty level, and a context that is conducive to the whistle-blowers.    Therefore, TISL calls on the Government, with the technical assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to rectify these concerns in the law forthwith and further, to continue to engage with citizens, experts, and civil society, in order to adopt a holistic approach to achieve the envisaged goal of eradicating corruption in Sri Lanka."

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Dr. Sirithunga lamented that the highest number of accident victim deaths, while receiving treatment in hospital, is also reported during this period. Starting from 8 April till about the 16 this a time that hospitals receive the highest number of accident victims and record the highest number that die while receiving treatment for the injuries sustained in them, he explained during a media briefing. A majority of hospital admissions are due to injuries sustained by falling. But the reason for the influx of admissions are road traffic accidents. “Also, there are those who sustain injuries due to animal bites, due to falling objects and assaults during the above -mentioned period,” Dr.Sirithunga said.  With the available data, a majority of deaths that occur during this period are due to road traffic accidents, drowning and poisoning. “Since we did not enjoy the Sinhala and Tamil New Year on a grand scale during the past two years as a result of Covid-19, we have noted that the trend will increase during these few days once more.” The attempt to accomplish a large number of things within a short period, sleepiness may result in increasing the speed of the vehicle that we are travelling in, he said. Drunk driving during the festive season and limited knowledge regarding the environment that they are in during excursions may result in accidents and drowning incidents. The Consultant Community Physician also warned that accidents could occur while preparing food items for the festival. “That too is something that people should be conscious of,” he said. Dr. Sirithunga also urged organisers of ‘Avurudu festivals’ to utilise the morning hours for their marathon events to prevent accidents from occurring due to excessive sweating.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Speaking to the media, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa, yesterday (11), called for an “impartial investigation into accusations of corruption made against the officials of the Health Ministry by AHP President Ravi Kumudesh.” “If the hospital administrators, assistant secretaries and Deputy Directors’ General of the Health Ministry were involved in corruption, fraud, and irregularities in the past, as he said action should be taken to conduct immediate investigations against those officials and take disciplinary action against them in order to restore the Ministry’s reputation,” Dr. Sanjeewa asserted. Dr. Sanjeewa said, “according to the AHP President, the Ministry of Health has been involved in corruption, fraud, irregularities and the purchase of various medicines, the purchase of laboratory goods during the last two years.” “It is the responsibility of the Health Secretary to conduct disciplinary investigations against the relevant officials, as there was enough and more evidence that Health Ministry officials were involved in corrupt deals when purchasing medicines, consumables, laboratory equipment and other materials,” he added. He also said the Health Secretary’s failure to take action would only result in him having acknowledged Kumudesh’s allegations of corruption. The MCPA President urged the Health Secretary not to hesitate in conducting an investigation against Kumudesh himself if he felt that the latter had only made such accusations out of malice towards Health Ministry officials and hospital authorities.     By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The name Chandana Ranaweera is a familiar one to the readers of Ceylon Today Features as he was a regular contributor to both Daily and Sunday Features with his reviews and personality features on local as well as foreign artists. When writing about local artists, he made it a point to highlight lesser-known yet deserving artists to keep their legacy alive and to create a discourse about their art. Chandana was also fascinated with the cultures of East Asian countries, in particular, Japan. He wrote about interesting and unique festivals in Japan on a regular basis, familiarising Sri Lankan readers with the culture of another part of the world.    Hailing from Alawwa, Chandana was an avid art fan since childhood and this undying passion for the artistic world led him to become an artist himself as well as an art teacher. For years, he enriched the artistic souls of students at Kandegedara Maha Vidyalaya and Rathnalankara Maha Vidyalaya in Alawwa, as a teacher. Since his retirement, he had dedicated his time to focus on his own art and the articles he wrote for Ceylon Today. He was a talented painter, with his niche being line drawings.  Chandana was a regular contributor to Ceylon Today and his untimely demise leaves a void another can hardly fill, as what made Chandana’s articles special was his undying passion for the world of art, a kind of passion hard to come by these days. Chandana faced some health issues in his last days, but his death came as a shock to many. His last rites took place at Kuliyapitiya Crematorium on 11 April. Ceylon Today, as well as its readership, will miss Chandana Ranaweera dearly. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!  "

They say several paddy lands and private lands have been taken over, causing tension in many areas. In the last ten days, there has been unrest in many villages as a result of certain officials, backed by a monk in the area, attempting to demarcate land as belonging to his temple, they alleged. The people of the area have invited MP M. A. Sumanthiran and MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), to express their dissatisfaction with the land grab that is taking place in the Eastern Province, particularly in the Pulmoddai area, which was once a peaceful place with a Muslim majority.   During last week’s dispute, a monk charged at the village people in an attempt to take the land in that area and a verbal argument between the two communities was highlighted on social media. The residents alleged the monk had joined several Buddhist clergy and had been attempting to illegally claim land and incite local tension. The Archaeology Department allegedly delegated their powers to the monks, who are also protected by the Ministerial Security Division, Sumanthiran said. In the Kuchchaweli Pradeshiya Sabha area, land grabbing is taking place and it is also alleged that the monk has attempted to change the laws to own the land. Several complaints have already been filed and a legal battle is currently ongoing. According to Sumanthiran, a significant number of people’s land have been taken over or attempted to be taken over. They have permits and deeds, but the authorities ignore them, he told the crowd gathered there.  The people claimed that the Department of Archaeology strongly supported the monk and granted him authority over land grab. Sumanthiran and Rasamanickam, who visited the area yesterday (10), were told by the community that they had never had a dispute with another community before and that this land grab in their area was ‘new’ to them. The two Tamil MPs stated that they will bring this issue to the attention of the people of the country as well as the international community and have also informed President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who confirmed that he would look into the matter after the April New Year. Rasamanickam asserted that in the last two weeks, this Buddhist priest has been frightening the people of Pulmoddai and frequently confronting the peaceful people. He said such land disputes and land grabs are occurring in the North and urged all Tamil-speaking people to come together to fight this serious issue and not to be victimised.     He claimed that long before he became a politician, the same monk had come in a Defender and attempted to grab land in a place called Vethuchenai and the people in the area chased him away. He also alleged that Muhudu Maha Viharaya and Pullmoddai areas are experiencing land grabs, which is occurring at a time when the Government is serious about reconciliation and attempting to find a national solution.

Chandrasiri claimed yesterday (10).  He said there was no way passengers could lose valuable items in the airport premises if not for their negligence and their failure to follow the given security instructions. Addressing a media briefing to respond to recent reports that a mobile phone of a passenger had been stolen at the airport on 5 April, Chandrasiri said when analysing the complaints, with regard to losing of items, money and baggage at the airport, it has been observed that the main reason for such incidents is negligence of the passengers. He alleged that there is an organised attempt to tarnish the service given by the airport officials by spreading false news on both main stream and social media. Chandrasiri, who refuted the reports about the loss of the mobile phone said they launched a probe into the alleged incident. He said that BIA officials had even inspected the entire CCTV Camera Footages installed at the BIA but they had so far failed to unearth details regarding the incident. Chandrasiri added that he had been informed in writing that the mobile phone of the Sri Lankan passenger had reportedly been seized by the security officers of a Middle Eastern country where the passenger had been in transit while en route to Colombo. He noted that reports to this effect being published in the local media and on various social media platforms sans verification, have tarnished the image of both the national carrier and the country in general and he advised the media to verify their stories ahead of publication. He said legal actions would be taken against all those who were spreading false news on the incident.  “There are many instances that airport employees found lost items and handed them over to the passengers. However, no one speaks about that. There has been no complaint in the last five years against an airport employee over stealing passengers’ items. If anyone wants more information on items handed over to the passengers, it can be obtained from the airport security and airport Police,” he said. (MD)"

Sources at the Teaching Hospital Peradeniya, when contacted said the patient had developed complications following the caesarean section and had been in the Hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU) for three days, where she had died. They said an investigation was being conducted into the unfortunate incident. Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said that immediate measures had been taken to withdraw the batch of the anaesthetic drug. A probe is also being conducted into the death as there may be various reasons for it, so it is too early to issue further comment, he noted. AHP President Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (10) alleged that the said anaesthetic had first been registered with the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) while registration had been subsequently revoked. However, the drug had been deployed in three batches to 25 hospitals, while hospitals like the Teaching Hospital Ragama had received the same batch as the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital.  He said the Health Ministry had withdrawn all batches of the said anaesthetic while a drug manufactured by Bangladesh, registered by Myanmar’s equivalent to the NMRA, had allegedly replaced the said anaesthetic. Kumudesh urged the Health Ministry not to merely blame the death of the pregnant woman on the particular anaesthetic drug and be satisfied but to also probe as to how the one drug had been replaced by another immediately. If Myanmar donated the medicines, as some of the health officials would like the public to believe, then it is worthwhile knowing how Myanmar’s health service, which is also suffering like Sri Lanka, was able to do so, he claimed. The AHP President said that the particular Bangladesh Manufactured drug, sent by Myanmar, was not registered with the local NMRA, nor has it been used in Sri Lanka before. So how will the Health Ministry and the NMRA reassure patients about its safety, he queried. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

It was prepared by another group and sent to the Legal Draftsman.

He compared the Bill to a letter written by a small child, claiming that it is full of serious errors and had not been submitted to Parliament in time. “To prevent this Bill from contradicting the Constitution, 80 amendments have been proposed by the Supreme Court.

The President made this remark during a discussion held at the Nuwara Eliya District Secretariat yesterday morning (10). During the discussion, the President directed officials to develop a formal plan aimed at maximising the contribution of the Nuwara Eliya District, a major tourist city, to the Sri Lankan Government’s programme to establish a stable economy within a four-year timeframe. The discussion also included the unveiling of the Nuwara Eliya New Town Development Plan and the Nuwara Eliya Tourism Plan. President Wickremesinghe said that despite the belief of many that the country’s economy could not be rebuilt, the agreement reached by the Government with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), provides an opportunity for fresh hope on the country’s economy. The President emphasised the importance of developing the Nuwara Eliya District as a striking city that can attract tourists throughout the year, targeting both local and foreign. He stressed the importance of preparing the development plans while considering the needs of tourists. He explained that the plans should prioritise creating a pleasant environment for tourists to relax, rather than focusing on constructing large buildings. He also pointed out that the absence of a formal system for rainwater drainage in Nuwara Eliya City is a long-standing issue and he urged officials to implement an urgent programme to address this problem. Additionally, he directed special attention to solving the problem of drinking water in the area. He further explained that buildings in the Nuwara Eliya City should be constructed according to a proper plan, rather than constructing buildings haphazardly. He emphasised that the city has suffered due to the construction of large buildings and that officials should consider whether to turn it into a bustling metropolis like New York or maintain its identity. The President highlighted the likelihood of an increase in tourist arrivals to Nuwara Eliya with the completion of the Central Expressway and stressed the importance of developing facilities according to a proper plan. He also emphasised that no party or invester should be allowed to damage the resources of the Nuwara Eliya District and that all development should be environmentally-friendly and well-planned. Furthermore, Wickremesinghe called for government officials and political authorities to work in a well-coordinated manner in these matters. He encouraged everyone to think beyond the traditional framework and align themselves with the new programme needed by the country. There was a detailed conversation regarding the development activities to be carried out in the city under the Nuwara Eliya City Development Plan, as well as the development of Nanu Oya as a sub-city. Plans were also made to develop Nuwara Eliya as a green city, by preserving forest conservation area and five suburbs were earmarked for development with Nuwara Eliya as the central hub. Additionally, the establishment of a university in Nuwara Eliya and the construction of a Ramayana Centre were also discussed during the meeting. The President issued instructions to modernise the Nanu-Oya Railway Station and establish a high-quality economic centre nearby. The aim is to enable farmers to pack their vegetables and transport them safely and conveniently to Colombo. The development of the racecourse and the lake, improvement of parking facilities and speedy implementation of a formal water management programme in Nuwara Eliya were given special attention during the discussions. In addition, a programme to increase the income of local residents and improve their lives was discussed at length. The discussion was attended by Minister Jeevan Thondaman, Nuwara Eliya District MPs S. B. Dissanayake, C.B. Ratnayake, V.S. Radhakrishnan and M. Rameswaran, President’s Secretary Saman  Ekanayake, NuwaraEliya District Secretary Nandana Galabada, and other State  officials."

This new shipment of urea fertiliser will be dispatched to over 72,200 smallholder paddy farmers who were severely impacted by the recent economic crisis in the Polonnaruwa, Badulla, Ampara, Matale, Puttalam, Kurunegala and Hambantota Districts and is integral to a four million Euro (approximately Rs1.5 billion) programme launched by FAO and the EU to address the agriculture and food security crisis in Sri Lanka, while supporting the introduction of integrated plant nutrient management strategy amongst identified paddy growers. Speaking on the support the EU has extended to revitalise Sri Lanka’s paddy cultivation sector, European Union Ambassador Denis Chaibi said, “The distribution of urea fertilisers for vulnerable farmers is one of many actions we undertook to respond to the socio-economic crisis affecting millions of people in Sri Lanka. We hope that with this new support we can prevent immediate food shortages but also contribute towards a transition to a more sustainable and resilient agriculture sector in the future.” Through this programme, every eligible farmer cultivating up to 0.5 Ha of land in the targeted districts will receive 50kg of urea fertiliser for the upcoming cultivating season. Additionally, the programme will also provide high-quality paddy seeds and the necessary technology/capacity building to boost the efficient use of fertilizer. Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera said, “This initiative by EU and FAO goes beyond providing material inputs and addresses the country’s long-term need to ensure sustainability of the local agriculture sector. I am appreciative of this support extended to our farmers as this will go a long way in helping Sri Lanka become a food secure nation.” “This consignment of essential urea fertilizer will be the first component of the multi-faceted support FAO will provide through valuable funding from the EU, to boost Sri Lanka’s paddy production and revitalize the local agriculture sector. We will work closely with the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Irrigation to ensure its success while helping the country’s agriculture sector improves its sustainability through capacity building and training of extension officials and farmers,” FAO Representative in Sri Lanka, Vimlendra Sharan said.  Crop failures during recent harvesting seasons due to shortages of fertiliser and vital inputs, have posed many challenges for smallholder paddy farmers to sustain their livelihoods. This programme seeks to encourage smallholder farmers through material and technical inputs to adopt scientific farming practices to enhance fertiliser use efficiency and strengthen the seed paddy production system in Sri Lanka to meet the current demand. The programme also aims to strengthen government seed farms by providing them with modern, state-of-the-art seed processing and drying machines."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The criminal gang posted the so-called recruitment advertisements on Chinese social media offering highly paid overseas jobs and promising to reimburse all travel expenses to lure potential job-hunters into traps. According to a report in Ceylon Today last week, Aluthgama Police detained about 39 Chinese nationals, in connection with online financial fraud and in April 2021, Police detained five Chinese nationals in connection with running an illicit gambling site, that was located on Lauries Road in the jurisdiction of Bambalapitiya Police. Over these nefarious activities, the Chinese Embassy noted that they had rescued 13 Chinese nationals who were trafficked to Sri Lanka, cut off from contacts with their families and the outside world and forced to engage in illegal activities such as telecom scams and internet gambling, the Embassy said in its media release. The victims were subject to threats against their lives and suffered physical abuses from corporal punishment and torture when they failed to accomplish their tasks or when they attempted to escape, the Embassy said. According to the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, victims involved in overseas telecom scams will most probably face punishment even if they were coerced into committing the crime, Zhao Guohua, lawyer and co-founder of Beijing Mingji Law Firm, told the Global Times on Sunday, noting that the criminals use job opportunities as bait to lure some young Chinese people who are under great employment pressure. The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka quickly coordinated with local Police to carry out rescue operations, upon learning of the situation, captured key members of the telecom fraud gang and the suspects involved in illegally harming and detaining the victims and successfully rescued the 13 Chinese nationals who were trapped by the scheme after they believed the so-called high salary, low threshold, short working hours, and enjoyable travelling welfare and other overseas job recruitment information. A similar rescue operation was conducted by the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar on Thursday with a Chinese national, smuggled into Myanmar and forced to engage in telecom fraud, rescued. In recent years, online gambling and telecom fraud have caused social problems in Southeast Asian countries such as Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka, with some Chinese nationals falling victims to murder, kidnapping and human trafficking. Some people are lured overseas by the promise of high salaries. A major human trafficking case was disclosed on Friday by the general border inspection station for entry and exit of South China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region under the National Immigration Administration. Police announced the dismantling of a large-scale trafficking gang that organised Chinese nationals to leave the country illegally by sea to engage in transnational criminal activities.  A total of 108 suspects from the gang were apprehended including 69 punished with prison sentences, ranging from nine months to eight years and fines between 5,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan (USD 29,093). One gang member said that it would promise a monthly salary of between 8,000 yuan and 16,000 yuan, even up to 20,000 yuan. Border police have reminded the public to stay vigilant and make sure to go overseas for work through a regular and legal labour agency. They should not believe recruitment ads that promise high salaries and benefits, which can not only endanger personal safety but also lead to crimes.                                               (SRM)"

It is the Government’s responsibility to take legal action against any enterprise that impedes the people and the country’s future, he added. Herath emphasised that great progress has been made in many areas of the country, compared to last year, but he also asserts that some anti-Government elements have been unable to bear this shift. He made these remarks at the Rambukkana Divisional Secretariat, on the occasion of the rice distribution to low-income individuals and while participating in the inauguration of the Agri Fresh-Sabaragamuwa shopping mall, which was constructed at the Wagolla District Agricultural Training Complex in Pinnawala. Nearly 11,150 low-income families in the Rambukkana Divisional Secretariat   were given 10 kg of rice each. “There has been a discussion about the Anti-Terrorism Act, which is an Act brought for the security of the country and the people. If anyone opposes it, it is a group that advocates terrorism and not a group that loves the country and the people,” he said. Currently, the cost of living is significantly lower than it was a year ago. The price of petroleum and gas has decreased and the Government has provided a number of concessions for the people during the holiday season, but it is uncertain whether the people will receive the benefits. Today, society points the finger at politicians for any challenge, he stressed. “We must realise that if Government officials do not execute their responsibilities adequately, the populace will despise politicians. Even though society demonstrates a need for a change in the attitude of politicians and citizens, State officials’ attitudes should be transformed. The inability of Government officials to provide the required support to the Minister of the relevant ministry is a significant barrier to meeting the demands of the people,” he said. Speaking further, Herath emphasised that unnecessary pressure is caused by officials failing to take the appropriate action at the right moment, and added that they should strive to fulfil the requirements of the people rather than the agendas of destabilising conspirators."

During the last phase of the humanitarian operation, the mines remained scattered haphazardly all over the whole area posing serious threat to human habitation. In 2002, Sri Lankan Government initiated the National Mine Action Programme aiming to create a mine and explosive devices-free environment. Aimed at establishing a mechanism for effective clearance of mines in Sri Lanka, the first course on Humanitarian De-mining began in 2003 at Embilipitiya Engineers’ School. In 2007, the Sri Lanka Army’s Humanitarian Landmine Clearance Unit took the responsibility for complete clearance of landmines. Significantly, the women’s cadre of the Sri Lanka Army recently began their contribution towards the de-mining process. Under the direction of the Commander of the Army, the Chief Field Engineer and the Corps of Engineers undertook the challenge of training women de-miners. Presently, the Sri Lanka Army has 435 de-miners, of whom 283 are performing duties on site.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

He was speaking at a party conference in Kolonnawa and said that people will take to the streets to express their desire for a national economy based on nationalism. “When all the leaders who emerged in Sri Lanka post- Independence are placed on one side of a scale, and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is placed on the other, the latter’s side is heavier. So, this is not a Party that can be brought down by torching houses, attacking, or threatening people,” he said. MP Kariyawasam also said during the SLPP’s tenure, no money was taken on loan and all existing debts were paid. “We, the SLPP, want to build the country without taking loans that your child will have to pay back later. Regardless of the economic difficulties, our tenure was the time when no loans were taken, but debts were settled. We can see how the leaders of the ‘Aragalaya’ protest movement are currently partying. Did the people of this country band up together for such a future?” he queried. Speaking further, he said his thinking was that the people will once again want the SLPP back in power to rule the country in the very near future, Kariyawasam said."

Taking to the IMF YouTube Channel, to detail supporting recovery and promoting stable and inclusive growth in Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer states that after years of increasing economic problems and policy mistakes, Sri Lanka has committed to report and rebuild. The IMF representative emphasised that the authorities have committed to improving public financial management and strengthening the anti-corruption legal framework. He also said that in addition, the IMF will assess governance and corruption vulnerabilities and provide recommendations. “We, at the IMF look forward to working closely with the people of Sri Lanka for a brighter future for all. The IMF is here to help. The fund has approved about USD 3 billion over the next four years to support Sri Lanka in this time of need,” he said. He said since 2019, significant tax cuts and delays in anticipated reforms have left the country entering the pandemic with thin currency reserves, high debt levels and no fiscal space to buffer against shocks.  “With no reserves left, power cuts, shortages of food and medicines, and long lines for petrol emerged. Sri Lanka defaulted on its debt for the first time in its history. There are no easy solutions, but that’s where everyone must come together to tackle this enormous problem,” Breuer said. He also pointed out that Sri Lankans must make efforts to continue their way out of the crisis while supporting the less fortunate, highlighting that the global community must support Sri Lanka in this effort, so that it can once again be on a path of strong and inclusive growth. “There are no easy solutions, but that’s where everyone must come together to tackle this enormous problem,” the top IMF officials said. Working with the Fund, the Sri Lankan authorities have put together an ambitious economic recovery programme, including reforms to raise government revenue, stabilise prices, build up foreign reserves and safeguard financial stability, he explained, adding that the Sri Lankan authorities are also asking their creditors to support their efforts by granting debt relief. “When a crisis strikes, the poor are hit the hardest. The programme aims to raise spending for the poor and vulnerable, strengthen social safety nets and introduce progressive tax reforms to ensure greater contributions come from high-income earners,” he said. In addition, Breuer has also highlighted that with breathing room from external debt relief, the IMF expects Sri Lanka’s economy to gradually start to recover and expand.  “It’s critical to ensure the hard-won gains from the reforms benefit the Sri Lankan people, and the crisis will not repeat itself” he said."

He, in his Easter Sunday message, said the necessary groundwork towards this end has been laid, to ensure justice for all the victims. “I pledge my unwavering commitment to ensuring the security of our country, by preventing any recurrence of such heinous acts,” he said. The President said that the Government is dedicated to realising the aspirations of all Sri Lankans, regardless of race, religion, party or colour. “Easter Sunday celebrates the ability of Lord Jesus Christ, as the Son of God, to transform lives by dispelling darkness in people’s minds and bringing hope to the world. With Easter commemorating the resurrection of Jesus, it is an occasion for us to reflect on the values of love, peace, and forgiveness as espoused by Him, which are at the core of Sri Lankan culture, and we must come together with family, friends and communities, to solemnise the blessings life has to offer. “We are presently seeking to overcome an era of unprecedented hardship, uncertainty and disappointment and are looking forward to a better tomorrow. The Government is dedicated to realising the aspirations of all Sri Lankans regardless of race, religion, party or colour. I strongly believe that we can overcome these challenges in the near future,” he added. “However, it is crucial that we all unite on a common agenda that elevates us beyond narrow political objectives and regressive trends and instead paving the way for the country toward progress. Let us all unite and work for a brighter future for Sri Lanka,” he said. “I am very much aware of the extreme pain caused by the Easter Sunday attack being still fresh in your minds and I share that pain. I wish to reassure you that the legal proceedings related to this tragic incident are being processed independently and impartially, without any influence. The necessary groundwork towards this end has been laid, to ensure justice for all the victims. I pledge my unwavering commitment to ensuring the security of our country, by preventing any recurrence of such heinous acts.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/04/10/did-248-sri-lankan-asylum-seekers-perish-on-their-way-to-new-zealand/,Did 248 Sri Lankan asylum seekers perish on their way to New Zealand?,Author not found,0,2023-04-09T20:50:00+00:00,"A Government log of attempts by asylum seekers to reach New Zealand shows a fishing trawler and its 248 Sri Lankan passengers will never be seen again. Immigration Minister Michael Wood has refused to be drawn on what information the Government has about attempts to reach New Zealand shores by boat. On 29 March, the day he introduced legislation extending the time people in mass arrivals can be held in detention, from four to potentially 28 days, his office also released a list of attempts to reach New Zealand and Australia. On 12 January 2019, “a 90 foot-long fishing trawler-turned-sailboat left Maliankara near Munambam, India, with 248 Tamil migrants onboard hoping to make it to Australia or NZ. The boat or the passengers have not been heard of since”. Its fate was never known – an RNZ story detailed its departure and concerns for the safety of its crew and passengers 10 days later. Police in India said an individual arrested in connection with the investigation, Prabhu Dhandapani, told them the boat was heading to New Zealand. Wood revealed that officials started looking at changes to the mass arrivals legislation later that same year, but work was delayed by Covid. The legislation changing detention time limits was about ensuring a large number of migrants or asylum seekers would be able to access full legal advice, he said. “I don’t think this is about being a deterrent [to people-smugglers and passengers] at all. “We have other activities that take place, we invest significantly in work with other countries to go to source and discourage people-smuggling, which is enormously dangerous and takes advantage of humans who are in some of the most desperate circumstances. So that’s the deterrence.” When asked about what intelligence the government had on smuggling, he instead referenced attempts already in the public domain. “On open source there is good information out there about the number of recent, reports of vessels emanating out of south and southeast Asia. And we have been pretty clear and on record, that there is good intelligence that New Zealand is a potential destination. “It is not a likely event and our physical distance offers us some protection. But if it does transpire, it is a very high impact event. “We note that Canada, in recent years, from a similar distance, has had an arrival and 10 years after that arrival they are still effectively dealing with that situation.” The list of publicly available mass arrival attempts shows the 2019 Tamil journey from Kerela as an attempt to get to Australia or New Zealand and its outcome – “disappeared”. It also records an October 2021 event in which 63 men were arrested in Trincomalee, Sri Lanka, for “allegedly intending to join a maritime venture to New Zealand”. “Police said that these suspects had packed for a long sea journey, with required clothing and coats to be worn in cold weather and there was a large quantity of luggage,” according to a Sri Lankan daily. “The racketeers had charged each person sums ranging from Rs 2.5 million to Rs 4 million (up to $19,577) on the promise that they would be sent to New Zealand. The Police also said that these persons are being questioned to find out whether they had to pay money in advance.” The remainder of the incidents were attempts to get to Australia between 2019 and 2022. Not on the list was an incident in which Australian Border Force intercepted another Sri Lankan boat destined for New Zealand and allegedly paid crew more than USD 30,000 ($44,576.52) to turn the boat around in 2015. And in 2013, a boat with a New Zealand flag and passengers holding a sign saying: “We want to go to New Zealand. Please help us” was stopped 400km north of Perth in Western Australia. To date, no maritime mass arrival attempt has successfully reached New Zealand. Former Prime Minister John Key said in 2015 that a boat carrying 65 Sri Lankans and Bangladeshis had been en route here, and vessels were now capable of making the journey. People smuggling is punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment and a fine of up to 500,000 dollars in New Zealand. Immigration New Zealand details how people smugglers and facilitators often mislead migrants about the risks of being smuggled, the chance of success and economic conditions in destination countries. As well as the risk of death from drowning in overloaded boats, passengers sometimes suffer physical or psychological violence, can be trafficked for forced labour or sexual exploitation and can also die from dehydration or starvation. In 2019, 25 million dollars was allocated over four years on prevention measures, including the expansion of New Zealand’s network of Migration Liaison Officers offshore. On the missing 2019 boat attempt, a blog “To The Antipodes, On A Boat Without GPS” by The Times of India, after the boat carrying 248 people left India, said the passengers were Sri Lankan Tamil refugees housed in Madangir Colony in New Delhi. “The colony was a result of the India-Sri Lanka accord in the 1980s, and these refugees were largely living in abject conditions,” Police told author KP Saikiran. They avoided using GPS, fearing their movements would be tracked by security agencies, in a journey expected to take about 25 days. “The boat must have either sunk in rough seas, or it could have been captured by Sri Lankan authorities, which also would have been fatal to those on the boat,” he concluded. “In all probability, either way, they would have lost their lives,” said Police sources. “Blue Corner notices were sent to both Australia and New Zealand through Interpol for all the 248 passengers, but no favourable information has been received.” (NZ Herald)"

The ADB and the World Bank assisted the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) in developing a paperless PMS similar to that used in the port of Rotterdam. “We are currently working on legislation to accommodate paperless work, and in the meantime, we request an EoI in two to three months for the fix of this PMS,” said Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation.  He said the Customs Ordinance is over 100 years and that it has to be amended to suit the public and not the officials at Sri Lanka Customs. Currently, a major delay in clearance is taking place where customers are pushed from pillar to post in releasing their consignments, he added.  The PMS would implement completely paperless work, allowing a customer to clear his consignment while remaining in his office and not physically present at all departments within the port, including quarantine, tax payment, and customs clearance, according to the Minister.  He also said the PMS will put an end to corruption and shady operations within the Port. The PMS would not cost the Government anything because it would be outsourced to a specialised company.  The chosen company will run it with experienced personnel for a reasonable fee. “It should be in place within the next 12 months. “Currently, clearing goods takes more than three days,” the Minister added.

The speakers pointed out that without a common agreement on key reforms, Sri Lanka’s recovery and its ongoing programme with the IMF could be at risk. The speakers emphasised the importance of implementing these reforms adhering to a plan for a reasonable period of time. The Convener of the Lanka Democratic Movement, Rasika Jayakody, explained that Sri Lanka is not in a position to move away from the IMF bailout package as the country is in a disastrous situation as far as the economy is concerned. Therefore, Sri Lanka did not have the luxury of choosing when it had the opportunity to negotiate with the IMF on better terms. The country had to pursue the IMF option after becoming a bankrupt nation, and now, it has to swallow a better pill. Jayakody emphasised that it’s crucial to implement these reforms without failing, and policymakers must understand the gravity of the situation and move in one direction for at least five years. Economist Rohan Masakorale emphasised the importance of policy stability in Sri Lanka. Masakorale explained that the country brought its economy on the right track in 1977, and there was significant progress between 1977 and 1982. However, after that, the country lost its way, and the riots in July 1983 caused many global companies that were exploring their investment prospects in Sri Lanka to go to Thailand. Moreover, the war erupted, and Sri Lanka paid a heavy price. The biggest downfall in Sri Lanka was the failure of successive governments to ensure policy stability. Masakorale pointed out that the Janasaviya programme was a progressive attempt to alleviate poverty through sustainable means. However, the government that came to power in 1994 politicised it and created a programme that did not produce the desired results. Sri Lanka must understand the gravity of the crisis and take corrective steps with consensus. Today, India has privatised all its ports, and Sri Lanka made a mockery of the plans related to the East Container Terminal at Colombo Port. The country wasted three years debating various conspiracy theories, and now it’s paying a heavy price for that. Attorney-at-Law and Chairman of Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG), Mangala Niyarepola, emphasised the absence of a master plan in Sri Lanka’s economy. He explained that political parties can include any fairy tale in their election manifestos as there is no mechanism to hold them accountable to their promises. Therefore, they end up doing ad-hoc projects without any rational basis, and they can manipulate the media and change public opinion closer to the election. That’s why Sri Lanka has ended up in this mess. Niyarepola said when there is no master plan, no rule of law, no mechanism to hold politicians accountable, and no transparency, no serious investor will come to the country. The majority of so-called investors coming to such a country could be driven by vested interests, which is a failure in the system that Sri Lanka must address. The country needs a grand master plan that has constitutional protection, an all-encompassing document prepared by experts and technocrats. Political parties should not be allowed to deviate from the master plan without a referendum, and an institutional framework must be set up to implement this master plan with the participation of the public. This is the only way Sri Lanka can drive the much-talked-about ‘system change’."

The Minister said in an interview with Ceylon Today that after reviewing the ADB report, they will request Expressions of Interest (EoI), but the Government will not focus on the project right away and it will take at least another five years to progress, as breakwater construction and dredging must be completed prior to calling for an EoI. The North Port will be able to accommodate six to seven port terminals depending on the demand, according to the Minister. The consultancy report, funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that prepared the drawings and the maps for the project, will be submitted to the President as well as the maritime community, the Minister said. The North Port is a big-budget port development project located on the north side of the Colombo Port. “It is the Government’s ambitious project, involving major construction work.

He was speaking  at the handing over  ceremony of 26 new buses acquired by Sri Lanka through the Indian credit line to Sri Lanka Transport Board depots in the Kandy district. Gunawardena said, the main reason for the country’s stability is because the Government, led by the President, boldly took rather painful steps without resorting to popular political decisions. He said, if the budget gap is reduced and foreign exchange reserves increase, the public will benefit, however, there will be a problem with foreign debt payment next year too. According to the Minister, giving concessions even when the country is not economically strong is the root cause of many crises and it was the IMF bailout package which brought relief. Gunawardena also said the depreciation of the rupee in relation to the dollar will result in a significant reduction in the import of goods. BY K. L. Suraweera – Kandy"

He added that the incumbent President has fearlessly accepted the challenge of reviving the country from a major crisis, and that he managed to stabilise the country within just a year. “I believe it is our responsibility and duty to strengthen the person who did this. At this point, we should set aside the politics of the SJB, JJB, and SLPP and strengthen the hands that have come forward to serve the country.

Further, he said some people claim they are selling their party to Wickremesinghe. He said Wickremesinghe does not require their party because he already has a good party. “We must accept that our country was in crisis when an SLPP President presided over it.

A segment of the released footage, taken less than two weeks before Wishma’s death, shows her bedridden and begging officers to take her to hospital after telling them she was unable to move or eat. In another piece of footage, from the day of her death, an officer tries to wake an unresponsive Wishma after reporting over an intercom that her fingertips feel cold. While Wishma’s family and some members of parliament have been able to privately view the footage, which the government submitted as evidence in a lawsuit, it marks the first time a portion of it has been made available to the public. Wishma arrived in Japan in 2017 as a student, but was taken into custody at the immigration facility in August 2020, for overstaying her visa. She died on 6 March 2021, after complaining of ill health, which included vomiting and stomach-aches, for around a month. Her death sparked national outrage over her treatment, forcing the government a few months later to drop a bill revising rules on foreigners facing deportation, including asylum seekers. Wishma’s family is seeking damages from the government over her death, alleging she was illegally detained and died due to a lack of required medical care. (The Mainichi)"

The agreement was entered into in 2017 between the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, the UDA, and the China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd. The Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ), which claimed that the Port city project was launched without adequate public consultations and a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment process in 2018, requested a copy of the above agreement from the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development of the Good Governance Government. At that time the request was denied on the basis of the presence of confidential clauses. In November 2018, the CEJ appealed to the RTI Commission requesting the release of the agreement. The RTI Commission accepted the appeal and the hearing process continued for four years. This is one of the longest hearings held by the RTI Commission. Over this period the Public Authority (PA) was changed to the Ministry of Urban Development, Water Supply and Housing Facilities and then to the Ministry of Investment Promotion in 2022. In between, the Port City Economic Commission was established through a new Act. On 20 July 2021, at the request of both the PA as well as the Office of the Presidential Secretariat, the Presidential Secretariat was added as an added respondent to this appeal. Further to the CEJ, Feisal Mansoor, on behalf of the All-country Fisheries Society, had also requested a copy of the agreement through the RTI Act. Both cases were heard together. Delivering the final order, Commissioner Kishali Pinto Jayawardena, of the RTI Commission, said the PA was unable to establish which clauses should be kept confidential and the TriPartite agreement signed in 2014 for the Colombo Port City development is in public domain through the judiciary process. Therefore, the Commission stated they do not recognise the necessity to keep the document out of public domain. This hearing process was very time taking and the government bought several excuses such as change of governments and the necessity to seek direction from higher officers to keep denying access to this information for the public. Finally, after several requests by the Commission, PA agreed to release some of the information in the agreement to the appellants on 29 September 2021. However, this information was not sufficient to clearly understand the full impact of the project. Therefore the appellant (CEJ) requested the full agreement."

The objective of bringing it is to protect the citizens of the country and remove some clauses of the current Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) that are being misused such as the power of the President to issue detention orders.

In a statement, the CEB said the acquiring process was initiated in the latter part of 2022, in accordance with the terms and condition of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). “The untiring efforts of the CEB team, led by CEB General Manager Eng. Rohan Seneviratne, have resulted in enhancing the CEB’s own power plant capacity by 163 MW. Under the Government of Sri Lanka policy framework, CEB signed the PPA with Sojitz Kelanitissa (Pvt) Limited in June 2000 as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) on BOOT basis. The contract period was for 20 years and the power plant is located in Colombo Kelanitissa Power Plant complex,” the statement said. CEB negotiations were very hard, especially due to economic constraints, obstacles, challenges, and many issues including legal aspects; but the CEB has managed to overcome those difficulties and finally owned a 163 MW power plant. CEB appreciates all those government entities that have helped immensely to complete the acquiring process successfully, according to the statement. Further, the CEB said it appreciates Sojitz Kelanitissa (Pvt) Limited for the operation of power plant over 19 years and for the cordial cooperation extended during the negotiation and transfer process of the facility. CEB has foreseen the future power requirements of the country and facilitated the acquisition process in order to increase its power generation capacity. The CEB owned 163 MW facilities is compatible with LNG with some minor modifications and hence enables to reduce the current cost of generation when conversion takes place, it said. (TR)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/04/07/omnipresent-but-under-diagnosed/,Omnipresent but Under-diagnosed,Author not found,0,2023-04-06T20:30:00+00:00," The global prevalence of the bipolar disorder is estimated to be around 1-2% of the population, with rates varying between countries and cultures. It affects people of all ages, races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds, and is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Despite its high prevalence and significant impact on individuals and society, the bipolar disorder remains under-diagnosed and undertreated in many parts of the world. Stigma and lack of access to mental health care are among the main barriers to proper diagnosis and treatment. Presently, research is going on to better understand the causes and underlying mechanisms of bipolar disorder, as well as to develop more effective treatments.  It includes mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and antidepressants and is among the most common treatments for bipolar disorder, and psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioural therapy and interpersonal therapy. Bipolar disorder also known as manic-depressive illness is a type of mental health condition that affects a person’s mood, energy, and ability to function. People with bipolar disorder experience episodes of extreme highs (mania or hypomania) and extreme lows (depression), which can last for days, weeks, or even months. During a manic episode, a person with bipolar disorder may feel euphoric or irritable, have racing thoughts, talk excessively, engage in risky behaviours, and have an inflated sense of self-importance. In contrast, during a depressive episode, a person with bipolar disorder may feel sad, and hopeless, and lose interest in activities they once enjoyed. They may also experience sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, and difficulty concentrating. Causes of the disease Bipolar disorder is a complex mental illness that is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurochemical factors. The specific causes of bipolar disorder are not yet fully understood, but its contributing factors include, a. Genetics: Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, suggesting that there is a genetic component to its development. Studies have identified several genes that may play a role in bipolar disorder, although the exact mechanisms by which these genes contribute to the disorder are still being investigated. b. Neurochemical imbalances: Bipolar disorder is associated with imbalances in certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which are involved in regulating mood, energy, and motivation. c. Environmental factors: Stressful life events, such as trauma, loss, or major life changes, can trigger bipolar disorder in some people. Substance abuse can also contribute to the development of a bipolar disorder, as drug and alcohol use can disrupt the brain’s chemical balance and trigger mood swings. d. Brain structure and function: Studies have suggested that people with bipolar disorder may have differences in the structure and function of certain areas of the brain that are involved in regulating mood, including the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. It’s important to note that bipolar disorder is a complex condition, and different people may experience it in different ways. Effects of the disease Bipolar disorder can have a significant impact on a person’s mood, behaviour, and overall quality of life. The major effects of the disease can be seen in: a. Mood swings: People with bipolar disorder experience episodes of extreme mood swings, ranging from periods of high energy and euphoria (mania or hypomania) to periods of intense sadness and hopelessness (depression). These mood swings can be intense and can occur unexpectedly, making it difficult for individuals to maintain stable relationships and hold down a job. b. Impaired thinking and decision-making: During manic or hypomanic episodes, individuals with bipolar disorder may experience racing thoughts, reduced need for sleep, impulsivity, and poor judgment.  This can lead to risky behaviour, such as excessive spending, substance abuse, and risky sexual behaviour. c. Relationship problems: Bipolar disorder can put a strain on relationships, as mood swings can make it difficult for individuals to maintain stable, healthy connections with others. Family members and loved ones may struggle to understand the sudden shifts in behaviour and mood and may feel frustrated or hurt as a result. d. Employment issues: Bipolar disorder can interfere with an individual’s ability to work, as mood swings can make it difficult to focus and complete tasks. Additionally, people with bipolar disorder may need to take time off work to manage symptoms, attend therapy, or receive medical treatment. e. Physical health problems: People with bipolar disorder may be at increased risk for physical health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, due to lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and substance abuse. f. Suicide risk: Individuals with bipolar disorder are at increased risk for suicide, especially during depressive episodes. It’s important for people with bipolar disorder to seek treatment and support to manage their symptoms and reduce their risk of suicide. These are just a few of the effects that bipolar disorder can have. With proper treatment and support, however, many people with bipolar disorder are able to manage their symptoms and lead fulfilling, productive lives. Precautions In this context, some precautions can be taken to manage the condition and reduce the risk of relapse or complications and the most important among them to consider are: a. Follow the treatment plan: It is important to follow the treatment plan recommended by the healthcare provider, including taking medications as prescribed and attending therapy sessions. This can help prevent relapses and improve overall functioning. b. Avoid alcohol and drugs: Substance abuse can trigger mood swings and interfere with treatment. It is important to avoid alcohol and drugs and to let the healthcare provider know if there is a history of substance abuse. c. Monitor mood changes: It is important to monitor mood changes and report any unusual symptoms to the healthcare provider. This can help identify early warning signs of relapse and adjust treatment accordingly. c. Get enough sleep: Sleep deprivation can trigger manic episodes. It is important to maintain a regular sleep schedule and get enough sleep. d. Reduce stress: Stress can trigger mood swings and increase the risk of relapse. It is important to identify sources of stress and develop coping strategies, such as relaxation techniques or exercise. e. Seek support: Bipolar disorder can be challenging to manage on your own and so it is important to seek support from family, friends, or support groups.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

During the festival, which was organized by the Sri Lanka German Technical Training Institute OBA (SLGTTIOBA), the consulate set up a booth to provide several consular services to the large numbers of visitors to the event.  During the full-day service, the Consulate staff helped members of the public who wanted to submit applications for new passports, dual citizenships, birth registrations and driving licence verifications.  The Consulate processed over 20 applications for the above, assisting applicants by reviewing the applications and supporting documents and advising on any gaps or corrections. To ensure a full service, the Consulate also provided on-site payment facilities and an online appointment facility, for those who wished to follow up with appointments to the Consulate. In addition, the staff also certified “life certificates” for pensioners and other documents.  Apart from these services, the staff fielded inquiries from over 600 visitors to the stall, on all consular matters, guiding people on applications, checklists of documents, fees, and next steps in the process.  Visitors to the booth commended the Consulate for this initiative, saying that it was very convenient for those who found it difficult to come to the Melbourne CBD, and many requested that the Consulate carry out similar services in the future.   Consul General Sandith Samarasinghe, also participated as a special guest in the official ceremonies of the New Year celebrations. During the opening ceremony in the morning, he participated in the flag raising ceremony, and conveyed the best wishes of President Ranil Wickremesinghe for the success of the event.  At the official ceremony in the afternoon, the Consul General congratulated the SLGTTIOBA for the successful New Year celebrations, which the association has been holding for over twenty years, and which was now recognized as the largest Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebrations in the world, outside of Sri Lanka. He appreciated the tireless efforts of the organizers in helping to keep alive Sri Lankan traditions and culture amongst the Sri Lankan community in Australia, and thanked the organizers for inviting the Consulate to be part of the event.  He assured that the Consulate was committed to continuing to build strong connections with the Sri Lankan community, within the overall environment of the rich Australian multiculturalism.   During the event, Consul General Samarasinghe met with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, and other key Australian leaders, including federal MPs, State MPs, Mayors and Councillors.  During his meeting with the Victorian Premier, the Consul General reiterated the strong ties between Sri Lanka and Australia, and the Consulate’s commitment to continue to strengthen these bilateral ties. The  Consul General also met with key leaders in the Sri Lanka community, and interacted with members of the Sri Lankan business community, associations and the general public, expressing the Consulate’s commitment to continuously engage with the community."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/04/07/omnipresent-but-under-diagnosed/,Omnipresent but Under-diagnosed,Author not found,0,2023-04-06T20:30:00+00:00," The global prevalence of the bipolar disorder is estimated to be around 1-2% of the population, with rates varying between countries and cultures. It affects people of all ages, races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds, and is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Despite its high prevalence and significant impact on individuals and society, the bipolar disorder remains under-diagnosed and undertreated in many parts of the world. Stigma and lack of access to mental health care are among the main barriers to proper diagnosis and treatment. Presently, research is going on to better understand the causes and underlying mechanisms of bipolar disorder, as well as to develop more effective treatments.  It includes mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and antidepressants and is among the most common treatments for bipolar disorder, and psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioural therapy and interpersonal therapy. Bipolar disorder also known as manic-depressive illness is a type of mental health condition that affects a person’s mood, energy, and ability to function. People with bipolar disorder experience episodes of extreme highs (mania or hypomania) and extreme lows (depression), which can last for days, weeks, or even months. During a manic episode, a person with bipolar disorder may feel euphoric or irritable, have racing thoughts, talk excessively, engage in risky behaviours, and have an inflated sense of self-importance. In contrast, during a depressive episode, a person with bipolar disorder may feel sad, and hopeless, and lose interest in activities they once enjoyed. They may also experience sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, and difficulty concentrating. Causes of the disease Bipolar disorder is a complex mental illness that is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurochemical factors. The specific causes of bipolar disorder are not yet fully understood, but its contributing factors include, a. Genetics: Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, suggesting that there is a genetic component to its development. Studies have identified several genes that may play a role in bipolar disorder, although the exact mechanisms by which these genes contribute to the disorder are still being investigated. b. Neurochemical imbalances: Bipolar disorder is associated with imbalances in certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which are involved in regulating mood, energy, and motivation. c. Environmental factors: Stressful life events, such as trauma, loss, or major life changes, can trigger bipolar disorder in some people. Substance abuse can also contribute to the development of a bipolar disorder, as drug and alcohol use can disrupt the brain’s chemical balance and trigger mood swings. d. Brain structure and function: Studies have suggested that people with bipolar disorder may have differences in the structure and function of certain areas of the brain that are involved in regulating mood, including the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. It’s important to note that bipolar disorder is a complex condition, and different people may experience it in different ways. Effects of the disease Bipolar disorder can have a significant impact on a person’s mood, behaviour, and overall quality of life. The major effects of the disease can be seen in: a. Mood swings: People with bipolar disorder experience episodes of extreme mood swings, ranging from periods of high energy and euphoria (mania or hypomania) to periods of intense sadness and hopelessness (depression). These mood swings can be intense and can occur unexpectedly, making it difficult for individuals to maintain stable relationships and hold down a job. b. Impaired thinking and decision-making: During manic or hypomanic episodes, individuals with bipolar disorder may experience racing thoughts, reduced need for sleep, impulsivity, and poor judgment.  This can lead to risky behaviour, such as excessive spending, substance abuse, and risky sexual behaviour. c. Relationship problems: Bipolar disorder can put a strain on relationships, as mood swings can make it difficult for individuals to maintain stable, healthy connections with others. Family members and loved ones may struggle to understand the sudden shifts in behaviour and mood and may feel frustrated or hurt as a result. d. Employment issues: Bipolar disorder can interfere with an individual’s ability to work, as mood swings can make it difficult to focus and complete tasks. Additionally, people with bipolar disorder may need to take time off work to manage symptoms, attend therapy, or receive medical treatment. e. Physical health problems: People with bipolar disorder may be at increased risk for physical health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, due to lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and substance abuse. f. Suicide risk: Individuals with bipolar disorder are at increased risk for suicide, especially during depressive episodes. It’s important for people with bipolar disorder to seek treatment and support to manage their symptoms and reduce their risk of suicide. These are just a few of the effects that bipolar disorder can have. With proper treatment and support, however, many people with bipolar disorder are able to manage their symptoms and lead fulfilling, productive lives. Precautions In this context, some precautions can be taken to manage the condition and reduce the risk of relapse or complications and the most important among them to consider are: a. Follow the treatment plan: It is important to follow the treatment plan recommended by the healthcare provider, including taking medications as prescribed and attending therapy sessions. This can help prevent relapses and improve overall functioning. b. Avoid alcohol and drugs: Substance abuse can trigger mood swings and interfere with treatment. It is important to avoid alcohol and drugs and to let the healthcare provider know if there is a history of substance abuse. c. Monitor mood changes: It is important to monitor mood changes and report any unusual symptoms to the healthcare provider. This can help identify early warning signs of relapse and adjust treatment accordingly. c. Get enough sleep: Sleep deprivation can trigger manic episodes. It is important to maintain a regular sleep schedule and get enough sleep. d. Reduce stress: Stress can trigger mood swings and increase the risk of relapse. It is important to identify sources of stress and develop coping strategies, such as relaxation techniques or exercise. e. Seek support: Bipolar disorder can be challenging to manage on your own and so it is important to seek support from family, friends, or support groups.

Secretary of Sri Lanka Excise Department Trade Union Collective and Secretary of the Sri Lanka Excise Officers’ Association Nirosh Jayakody said this at a media briefing in Anuradhapura yesterday (5). Jayakody highlighted that incentives are paid to all officers working in the Sri Lanka Excise Department as well as departmental officers of the combined services, and that the incentive was paid for three years before being discontinued this month. “Although the administration and Finance Ministry provided some explanations, the main reason was a lack of funds to pay the incentives. We forwarded proposals to the Ministry of Finance four times, through the administration on how to get the money to pay the incentive and how to strengthen the fund from time to time.” However, no action was taken by the Ministry of Finance. As a result, we had decided to hold a one-day symbolic strike with the uniformed staff and all unions of the combined services in the Sri Lanka Excise Department on 6 April,” he said. Speaking further, he said not only should all excise offices be closed, but all liquor factories as well, but if that happened, the Government will lose approximately Rs 1 billion per day, depending on present production levels. “Several rounds of discussions took place as we were preparing to take trade union action. Then, on 4 April, discussions were held with the Excise Commissioner in the morning and with State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and Director General of Trade Unions to the President Saman Ratnapriya in the evening. By evening, we had a satisfactory response,” he said. Claiming that Siyambalapitiya and the Excise Commissioner said a system will be prepared and finalised within a month to pay the incentives to the excise officers, he said, “After that system is completed, the payment date will be determined, and we agreed on that. Because the Government is presently unable to pay salaries, and losing tax money is also a problem, we have decided to cancel the strike scheduled for 6 April.” Jayakody mentioned that Siyambalapitiya will intervene in all future activities with regard to the matter and Ratnapriya promised that they will intervene and take necessary action as well. Thus, they will not hold the strike today and will continue to work as usual, he said. “We decided on 4 April that if this system is not put in place within a month, we will resort to strike action. If we go on strike, we will seize all of the factories that produce alcohol. Our officers are in charge of their security seals and work in their excise units. If our workers stop working, alcohol production will come to a halt on that day. There is a lot of alcohol production these days for the holiday season. Some organisations work 24 hours a day, while others work 16 hours. Every day, we estimate that between Rs 1 billion – 1.1 billion is collected as revenue. A significant amount is also made through activities such as raids,” he added. By Thisara Samal – Anuradhapura"

He said some of the professionals have still not accounted for their actions.  “Certain people misguided the whole Cabinet of Ministers stating that burying the Covid dead would spread the virus, which caused tremendous hardship to the public and antagonised Islamic countries which created the economic downturn. I said the President had to leave and the professionals who advised him had remained unpunished. The former President was extremely concerned about the businesses and doctors prevented opening of the country,” he elaborated. Speaking further, Dr. de Silva said defence was somewhat guided by a few professionals with unscientific approaches and he thinks it is unfair by the former President to state that he hampered the operation.  “I who have worked with many ministers think that it was a great decision taken by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to appoint Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle as the Minister to control Covid. The problem was that a group of doctors in high powered committees took many decisions in defiance of the Covid Control Ministry’s thinking. I think the former President tried a lot with many of the wrong advisors which is very unfortunate.” (DJ)"

In a tweet, Dr de Silva, said the assistance of the corporate sector was recently requested due to a lack of State funds to operate the free ambulance service. Commending the assistance provided by the corporates he said Rs 525 million received for this year will support the operations of 105 ambulances. The programme to save the ambulance service has been launched by the Board and Management of the Suwaseriya ambulance service. This is due to the Treasury being unable to fully fund its operations which may lead to the service being unsustainable in 2023.  Thereby, it was launched to request corporate and individuals to provide funding for an ambulance at a cost of Rs 5 million each.

Issuing a statement, Nanayakkara said yesterday (5) that trade union leaders of government and semi-government institutions are required to submit their assets and liabilities statements according to the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act. He pointed out that, however, no union leader has provided such a statement thus far to the Labour Secretary annually as required by law. “Therefore, the Labour Secretary is presently making an effort to obtain assets and liabilities statements from such union leaders at the earliest. The Ministry of Labour has not acted on the matter in the past. The Ministry Secretary will request such assets and liabilities statements in the future from union leaders from government and semi-government institutions,” he added. Nanayakkara said Government employees are bound by the Establishment Code. It sets out guidelines when appointing officers to trade unions. “Some employees who have worked in trade unions for twenty to thirty years have not done their assigned work, even for a single day. The people should decide whether it is correct to appoint people to trade unions in government and semi-government institutions and pay salaries for 20 years for not doing their work. Government businesses are maintained by people’s taxes. Is it fair to make collective agreements and allow such union leaders to get two or three salaries and receive millions in overtime payments even when such institutions are making losses?” queried Nanayakkara.

Addressing a workshop on ‘The response of Sri Lanka’s health system to the Covid-19 pandemic,’ Dr. de Silva said yesterday (4) that the advice which had been given to former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on several matters including Covid control had cost him (Rajapaksa) his position as the Head of State.  He said one must be very cautious when taking advice. Dr. de Silva, who was also the Secretary to the State Ministry of Covid-19 control, said while the President had been ousted by the people, there were those who had given him advice during the height of the pandemic who were doing quite well in society. Those persons were now attempting to get close to the incumbent Head of State and the Government, he cautioned. Noting that he had been instrumental in getting the private sector involved in testing for the virus, Dr. de Silva said it had seemed irrational to stop them from getting involved when it was considered okay for them to carry out open heart surgery. The Secretary to the Sports Ministry said his visit with the State Minister of Covid Control to the airport at the time had shown that certain measures and instances should have been downplayed and that advisories and governance were key to manage the situation well. Citing further incidents, he alleged that although the military involvement had been helpful, there had been instances when those medical practitioners who had examined patients with Covid were rounded up and quarantined. Meanwhile, Executive Director and Fellow of the Institute for Health Policy, Dr. Ravi Rannan-Eliya observed that even if it was democratic to use the military for pandemic prevention it should be done judiciously rather than just by issuing orders or vague instructions.  Project Investigator, Institute for Health Policy, Dr. Sanjaya Perera said the military had run 233 quarantine facilities while handling 80 per cent of arrivals in the country.

He said if taxes are collected and information is obtained through the computer network system, of the State’s main tax collecting institutions, such as the Inland Revenue Department, the Excise Department and the Customs Department, the State’s tax revenue will definitely increase. When asked if it is possible to prepare a system to subject private tutoring classes to income tax, calculate their income tax, and receive tax, he said it is possible. “If the tax net is greatly expanded, even though the income of many people will be small, the tax burden will be small and fairer,” he said. Speaking at the Cabinet media briefing yesterday, he said the tax burden would then be reduced. “There are many people in the country who are not taxed at all. Taxation was necessary in order to increase State revenue as instructed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the tax limit proposed by the IMF had to be agreed to,” he said.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

A report published by CEJ stated that under Sri Lankan Law, the case to claim compensation has to be filed within two years of the incident, thereby before 29 May 2023. It was observed that the failure to do so would be a failure on the part of the Attorney General’s Department and the Cabinet of Ministers. “For now, there is a request for USD 6.4 billion as compensation for the harm caused to the marine environment, the shore and the neighbouring communities, tourism, fishermen, and the pollution it caused to the atmosphere. Based on legal advice, CEJ identifies that the existing legal precedents in Sri Lanka are sufficient to receive compensation which was reiterated by other professionals. However, at present, the Cabinet, the Ministry of Justice, together with the Attorney General’s Department, have taken the decision to conduct legal proceedings in Singapore, creating a sense of uncertainty. We have been informed that an Australian has advised the Government of Sri Lanka to do so and that the Singaporean authorities are already preparing for the necessary proceedings.

Addressing a workshop on ‘The response of Sri Lanka’s health system to the Covid-19 pandemic,’ Dr. de Silva said yesterday (4) that the advice which had been given to former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on several matters including Covid control had cost him (Rajapaksa) his position as the Head of State.  He said one must be very cautious when taking advice. Dr. de Silva, who was also the Secretary to the State Ministry of Covid-19 control, said while the President had been ousted by the people, there were those who had given him advice during the height of the pandemic who were doing quite well in society. Those persons were now attempting to get close to the incumbent Head of State and the Government, he cautioned. Noting that he had been instrumental in getting the private sector involved in testing for the virus, Dr. de Silva said it had seemed irrational to stop them from getting involved when it was considered okay for them to carry out open heart surgery. The Secretary to the Sports Ministry said his visit with the State Minister of Covid Control to the airport at the time had shown that certain measures and instances should have been downplayed and that advisories and governance were key to manage the situation well. Citing further incidents, he alleged that although the military involvement had been helpful, there had been instances when those medical practitioners who had examined patients with Covid were rounded up and quarantined. Meanwhile, Executive Director and Fellow of the Institute for Health Policy, Dr. Ravi Rannan-Eliya observed that even if it was democratic to use the military for pandemic prevention it should be done judiciously rather than just by issuing orders or vague instructions.  Project Investigator, Institute for Health Policy, Dr. Sanjaya Perera said the military had run 233 quarantine facilities while handling 80 per cent of arrivals in the country.

The South African Government is legitimising a seriously flawed process by extending the invitation to two people who are perceived as lacking credibility and legitimacy due to their close ties to the previous regime, they said in an official statement. The South African undersigned civil society organisations, which are members of the South African Coalition for Transitional Justice (SACTJ), urged the South African Government to withdraw its invitation to Sri Lankan officials to discuss the transitional justice system in light of the country’s ongoing human rights violations. “We urge the South African Government to work with Sri Lanka instead to ensure that the Government ends the pervasive impunity for serious human rights violations, continues to tolerate dissent and resistance from civil society organisations, and fosters an environment that is conducive to an effective international justice process in accordance with the advice of various UN agencies,” seven top South African human rights defenders said in their official statement. They expressed concern about the Sri Lankan Government’s attempt to comprehend and establish credible transitional justice mechanisms in accordance with co-sponsored UN resolutions, claiming that the two Sri Lankan officials who recently visited South Africa lack credibility and legitimacy due to their close ties with former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who is alleged to have committed gross international human rights violations. The Foundation for Human Rights, Human Rights Media Center, Khulumani Support Group, Violence Prevention Agency, Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, Open Secret, and Centre for Applied Legal Studies questioned Foreign Minister Ali Sabry and Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe’s trip to South Africa on the invitation of South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Dr. Naledi Pandor to learn from South Africa’s experience in conflict resolution. Further, Sri Lanka’s intent on TRC is lofty and pointed out the failure of the Sri Lankan Government to ensure criminal accountability for gross human rights violations perpetrated during the 1983-2009 war. They recalled that the former President came under fire when he visited Singapore, where a case was brought against him on the basis of the principle of universal jurisdiction in Singapore for his alleged role in the gross human rights violations during the last stages of the war. They also pointed out that a separate case was brought against him in the US in 2019, during his presidency, for putting his close allies in positions of power. They also said some of the prominent persons have been sanctioned by countries including the US and Canada for their alleged involvement in the commission of gross human rights violations. Further, they said Minister Sabry, who served as the former President’s personal Attorney and represented him in numerous corruption cases while also serving as the Minister of Justice at the time, raised serious questions about a potential conflict of interest given that Gotabaya was the President at the time. The present Justice Minister at the time acknowledged that he had spoken with the Attorney General to block the arrest of the President in the Avant Garde floating armoury case.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/04/05/acepa-urges-govt-to-enhance-local-egg-production/,ACEPA urges Govt to enhance local egg production,Author not found,0,2023-04-04T20:30:00+00:00," The All Ceylon Egg Producers’ Association (ACEPA) urged the Government to work towards uplifting egg production in the country rather than trying to impress people with imported eggs. ACEPA Secretary Ratnasiri Alahakoon said that the hydrogen peroxide used to help extend the shelf life of the imported eggs was a chemical that was normally used to cleanse wounds. “If that was the case, how was it that the same chemical substance was not given to local egg farmers during the Covid-19 period, when they had to travel in vans and retail eggs at nine to ten rupees in fear, that the produce would pass shelf life and would have to be destroyed,” he said. “Further, are the State authorities trying to impress upon the general public it is fine to use chemicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, formalin or carbide water mixture to increase shelf life of perishable consumer products such as eggs, fish, fruits vegetables etc,” he queried. Alahakoon claimed that while egg farmers in Sri Lanka had been banned from using antibiotics as poultry feed additives, they had been asked to use Probiotics and Prebiotics. This is to prevent antibiotic resistance in animals and humans alike. However, it is a known fact that antibiotics are widely used as feed additives in chicken farms in India. He claimed that although the Bakery Owners were widely promoting the imported eggs it was highly doubtful as to how safe the Indian eggs were to be used in cakes and pastries – which are favourites amongst children.   He said that while an Indian egg had been purchased at Rs 16 each it was being retailed to the consumer at Rs 35 in Colombo and its suburbs. What needs to be found out is who benefits from the additional Rs 19. Alahakoon said that while the consumer was being made use of to promote the necessity of at least importing eggs to the country, the subject minister and his supporters are trying to impress on the people that importations would stop once the country is able to enhance local egg production, he alleged.

President and Secretary of the CBCSL, Rev. Drs. Harold Anthony Perera and J.D. Anthony Jayakody said on Monday (3) that media reports had revealed that an Interim Order had been given by the Judges of the Supreme Court regarding a fundamental rights case directing the Treasury Secretary and the Attorney General’s Department to not withhold the funds already allocated to conduct Local Government Polls in the 2023 Budget. The duo said, “It was reported that a Member of Parliament had requested the Speaker to refer the conduct of the Judges of the Supreme Court that delivered that Interim Order as a breach of Parliamentary privileges.” They alleged that the Speaker had accepted the request and made a referral to the Parliamentary Committee on Ethics and Privileges. Rev. Dr. Perera who is the Bishop of Kurunegala and Rev. Dr. Jayakody who is the Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo alleged that the State Minister had proceeded to take action based on the aforesaid Interim Order made by the Supreme Court with regard to Local Government Elections until the Parliamentary Committee concluded its probe. “In our view, such conduct directly violated the independence of the Judges to perform their powers and functions without any interference as enshrined in Article 111C of the Constitution and also threatens to disrupt the very doctrine of the separation of powers of our motherland,” they said.     Rev. Drs. Perera and Jayakody said the duty of the Government and other institutions was to respect and observe the independence of the Judiciary, while such interference demonstrated by these individuals of the Government had already been widely criticised locally and internationally as being serious and unwarranted encroachment on the Judiciary’s independence and its function within the country. They urged the Government to restrain and defend any attempts made by certain individuals under cover of privileges to curtail media institutions that were directly critical towards its (Government) activities which directly threatened to infringe on the freedom of speech and expression which were also preserved by the country’s Constitution.  (DJ)"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He said the counter-terrorism provisions must be in accordance with International Human Rights Law. Muchena concluding his six day official visit to Sri Lanka, on 2 April, met and engaged with a number of important stakeholders, including members of the government, activists, political parties, members of civil society and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as part of his ongoing advocacy work to advance human rights in Sri Lanka and the surrounding region, besides launching the South Asia regional Amnesty International’s Annual Report 2022-23. On the International Monetary Fund (IMF) he reiterated their concerns that the bailout package for Sri Lanka, which is USD 2.9 billion must meet minimum international human rights standards and not result in cuts on vital public goods and services, at a time when Sri Lankans continue to suffer the impacts of an economic crisis. Any agreements and terms and conditions linked to the bailout decision should be made transparent and available for public scrutiny. “At a time when many actors, including some in the international community, have chosen to turn a blind eye to the urgent human rights challenges in Sri Lanka, my visit to the country was an opportunity to listen to affected communities, understand their concerns and have their lived experience guide our work to protect and strengthen human rights in the country,” he said. He added that the AI stands in solidarity with victims of human rights violations from across the island, many of whom they had met and heard their concerns, over the past few days. He said, the AI will continue to work to uphold and protect their right to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. The victims of human rights violations in the context of the civil war and its aftermath as well as organisations working on enforced disappearances, must also urgently and genuinely be engaged by the government to hear their long-standing demands for truth, justice and reparation, he emphasised.

Speaking at the event, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha emphasised the importance of English as a learning tool, as well as the importance of a good education, in order to be prepared for future professional fields in the country. According to him, the Ministry of Education has already trained 13,800 primary school teachers for the programme. Premajayantha said, no professional can continue to rely on previous knowledge and by knowing today what will happen tomorrow through updated knowledge of English, which is very important as a link language. He said this is important in providing an education suitable for the future professional field in Sri Lanka. “My expectation is to provide practical speech training, so that it can be handled without hesitation or nervousness and approximately 13,800 primary teachers have been trained so far. Apart from a few schools, English medium education did not exist in the country after 1962 and in the year 2000, GCE Advanced Level subjects were taught in the English medium to some extent, and now more than 550 schools above Grade six teach science, commerce, and arts subjects in the English medium,” he noted. He also claimed that in international schools in Sri Lanka, local and foreign children are educated in English from the start, and that the field of foreign employment in the future is largely open to them. In order to close the gap, he stressed that English language education will be expanded in Government schools and that this programme will be integrated with the compulsory English subject that is taught in grades two and three beginning next year. Under the patronage of Premajayantha, the programme was launched at the Primary Section of Samudradevi Balika Vidyalaya. In addition, Premajayantha said there is no possibility of neglecting the Sinhala language in violation of the constitutional law that states that basic education from Grades 1-5 should be provided in the mother tongue. “It is hoped that parents’ expectations will bear fruit, allowing children to open up to the world ahead. A pleasant environment will be created in the classroom for both the teacher and students to engage in practical activities and happily engage in the learning-teaching process. Educators should be on the lookout for friendly and enjoyable strategies to teach subjects such as mathematics and the environment in the same way through the new STEAM – Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics – process that will be implemented in the education sector in Sri Lanka in the future,” he noted."

He explained that one type is staff of CPC and Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal Ltd (CPSTL) who withdrew from duty and fully committed to trade union action, and the other type is retired employees who work in trade unions. “Approximately 95 per cent of the employees did not participate in the trade union action. I directed the heads of these two institutions to take the strictest disciplinary and legal action possible against the individuals who were attempting to disrupt the institutions’ smooth operations. These 20 people have been sent on compulsory leave. An investigation will be conducted to determine how these people entered the terminals,” he said. In addition, he said these individuals are supported by the SJB, JJB, JVP, or SLPP. He highlighted that a committee will be formed to examine the CCTV footage and investigate the complaints made by staff before deciding on the next course of action. The CPC Trade Unions’ Collective staged a Satyagraha on 27 March. They later called off the Satyagraha on 28 March and decided to go on strike, withdrawing from fuel filling and distribution. The Minister then called for strict action against employees and trade union activists of both CPC and CPSTL, in the event they disrupt fuel distribution or hinder the work of other employees.

They displayed photographs of alleged victims and urged Pieris not to work for underworld figures like ‘Harak Kata.’ A woman who claimed to be the wife of a person who was murdered on the orders of ‘Harak Kata’ said, “It is so unfair that the lawyers are speaking on behalf of persons like Harak Kata. Before taking steps to protect underworld figures, justice should be served to their victims. Harak Kata killed my husband and the Police are yet to launch an investigation into that. It is a shame that the lawyers are trying to protect underworld leaders saying that they can represent any person. They should not feed their families with Harak Kata’s proceeds from drug trafficking. Equality should prevail,” she alleged."

Dr. Wickremesinghe explained that if the person had not given prior approval for his or her organs to be donated then it is up to the relatives to decide as to whether they wished to donate the organs of their loved one who was brain dead.  There was further demand for heart-lung transplant in the country and steps would be taken to master the technology and the surgical capacity further by involving other units and hospitals in the process. He said that there was a list of patients who required organ transplants in several hospitals in the country. Fielding questions Dr. Wickremesinghe said when obtaining organs, there was a method of reviewing as to whether the organ was being bought or being donated.    In a landmark surgical intervention, the Colombo National Hospital surgeons transplanted a heart and a lung to a single patient (recipient) who was suffering from severe lung disease which had gradually affected her heart. The patient had been at the NHSL prior to the surgery.  He said local surgeons had been preparing for the pivotal surgical intervention for the patient with the lung disease from 2021. “However since we had never undertaken such a serious surgical venture and lacked experience, the Sri Lankan team also sought the expertise of their counterparts at MGM Hospital Chennai, India”, he said. Dr. Wickremesinghe said doctors from India had arrived in Sri Lanka and examined the patient and explained what was needed. A surgical plan was drawn out inclusive of the medicinal drugs that would be required, surgical consumables and equipment required. “We met Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and explained that a policy decision needed to be taken to make the surgery a possibility,” he explained. “A decision was taken to perform the transplant surgery at the NHSL,” he said adding that the Director General Health Services (DGHS) issued a circular calling for the NHSL to prepare for the surgery. Dr. Wickremesinghe said that a special Intensive Care Unit (ICU) had been set up, while the patient continued to remain under the care of Cardiologist at the hospital. Cardiothoracic Surgeons, Anaesthetists, Cardiologists, Consultant Thoracic Surgeons, Organ Transplant Surgeon, Respiratory Surgeon nursing, Perfusionists and health assistants made up the team that performed the transplant.  The donor was a brain dead person. Four or five attempts were made to harvest organs from brain dead patients in the past but had failed. The first organ to be harvested is the lung which is the primary entry point for any germ while the patient’s size also matters. But the lungs harvested from brain dead patient from the Teaching Hospital Kurunegala were ideal for the patient at NHSL, he said. “It took over 18 hours to perform the transplant which included harvesting the organs and transplanting them in the recipient. It was a tremendous surgical feat that was accomplished. Surgeries were carried out in two separate theatres in two hospitals. Although the chief surgeon was from India, local doctors too closely assisted in the procedure until the surgery was complete and the patient was transferred to the ICU. He said the country required more such surgeries in the future. The patient who underwent the heart- lung transplant is still warded in the ICU while she was still in critical condition. But within the next few days it is hoped that she would recover and be normalised, he added. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Police received the Government Analyst’s report with regard to the third DNA test on Sara Jasmine yesterday (29). Police said DNA of Sara Jasmine’s mother was compared with the DNA samples of several bones found at the Sainthamaruthu blast site. “The result of the test positively proved that the two persons had a relationship of a mother and a child. Accordingly, the DNA test determined Rajaratnam Kavitha has a 99.9999% of probability to be the biological mother of the person whose bones were subjected to the test. “ Just days after the Easter Sunday Attacks, several persons, including children, were killed in a bomb explosion inside a house in Sainthamaruthu, Kalmunai on 26 April 2019. Mohamed Rilwan, one of Zahran Hashim’s brother detonated the bomb. Despite the fact that 17 people died in the explosion, the DNA samples taken from the bodies on two occasions did not match Rajaratnam Kavitha. There were suspicions that Sara Jasmine had fled to India, following a testimony of a witness before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on the Easter Sunday Attacks, who claimed she could have tipped off Indian intelligence about the impending attack. The remains of those killed in the Sainthamaruthu bomb blast in 2019 were exhumed on 27 April 2022, following an order from the Kalmunai Magistrate’s Court. The remains buried at the Ampara cemetery were exhumed in the presence of the Ampara Magistrate, the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO), and Police Officers involved in the initial investigations, as well as the Government Analyst.

On 26 March, a 35-member Thai delegation led by Auramon Supathaweethum, Director General of the Department of Trade Negotiations, arrived in Sri Lanka for the fourth round of talks. Along with their focus on trade negotiations, the delegation also strengthened long- standing religious and cultural ties between the two countries by offering over 500 alms- bowls to the Gangaramaya Temple on the same day. The National Trade Negotiations team representing Sri Lanka at the talks was led by chief negotiator of the Presidential Secretariat K.J. Weerasinghe. The team comprised officials from various departments, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Trade, Commerce and Food Security, Ministry of Industry, Department of Trade and Investment Policy, Attorney General’s Department, Department of Commerce, Department of Agriculture, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and Board of Investment (BOI). They participated in the negotiations on behalf of Sri Lanka. During the third round of negotiations in January, discussions on the proposed Sri Lanka- Thailand Free Trade Agreement focused on areas such as trade in goods, trade in services, investment, rules of origin, customs cooperation, trade facilitation, and economic cooperation. The fourth round of talks will build on the principles already agreed upon, and delve deeper into these areas. Additionally, discussions will be held on trade remedies, technical barriers to trade (TBT), and legal matters. Prior to the fourth round of negotiations, the National Trade Negotiations Committee and relevant sub-committees engaged in discussions with various industry sectors and stakeholders. The points raised during these discussions were taken into consideration and used appropriately during the fourth round of talks. The Sri Lankan negotiating team’s goals for the talks focussed not only to increase Sri Lankan exports and access to the Thai market, but also to improve market access to other ASEAN countries through the Thai market, and to reduce existing non-tariff barriers.

The Governor has ordered the Jaffna MC to vacate the Navalar Cultural Hall by 6 April. Several former MC members submitted a petition to the Governor’s Secretariat regarding this matter yesterday (28). The Governor told Ceylon Today that the Jaffna MC does not have work nor has proven any good work conducted at the said hall. “This is a decision to run the hall properly,” he said.  However, the former MC members rejected his claims. The group led by former Jaffna Municipal Council member V. Partheepan visited the Northern Province Governor’s Secretariat and handed over a petition stating that the Navalar Hall was jointly operated by the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs of the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, and the Jaffna MC. Navalar Cultural Hall has been operating under the Jaffna Municipality and has a public library, but the hall has been requested to be returned after many calls from the Ministry. The issue of handing over operations to the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs has been debated by the two parties at every meeting for a prolonged period, but the MC has consistently rejected the proposal. The joint venture was approved after many Hindu prelates, devotees, and academics requested it, and on 21 November 2021, then MC Mayor V. Manivannan, members of the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs, and others decided to operate the hall jointly. However, the petitioners say unexpectedly on 6 April the Governor requested the MC to vacate the building, claiming that the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs will handle operations under the guidance of the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs. “When the joint venture was announced and the progress is continuing on that path, with no proper reason the MC asked to vacate,” they added. The petitioners denounced the action and insisted that the joint meeting was scheduled for 2021 and that it must proceed as per schedule. The protesting former MC members said the Navalar Cultural Hall has served as a memorial to Sri Arumuka Navalar, who was born 200 years ago. They held commemorative programmes in collaboration with the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs.

Speaking at a media briefing held yesterday (28), the ITAK MP said the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) has been replaced with a new Act called the Anti-Terrorism Act, which has been published in the Government Gazette. “The PTA was enforced for more than 40 years in the country and it was heavily criticised. Many persons called for its repeal. When the present President was the Prime Minister in 2017, he promised the European Union that he would repeal the PTA. It was discussed with people’s representatives and public organisations, and many mistakes were pointed out and corrected at the time. They used the 2019 Easter Attacks as an excuse not to carry it out,” Sumanthiran said. The recent Anti-Terrorism Bill cannot be compared with the PTA, he said and asserted “It is even worse than that. We totally oppose this new Bill and will take legal action against it.” If a new law is to be brought on top of PTA, it should be agreed on with the public organisations first, while the Human Rights Commission had already put forward a report last year regarding repealing the Anti-Terrorism Act. That means there is no need for a special law to prevent terrorism, he stressed. “The Government has deviated from the democratic path without holding the elections and stalled the Provincial Council Elections for a prolonged period. Now even after the announcement of the Local Government Election, only one person in the country is holding back the elections citing the economic situation,” he alleged. This action, the MP added, is proof that the Government is nothing but a dictatorship. “Therefore, in this environment, we strongly condemn the fact that the Government has brought a special law called the Anti-Terrorism Bill to suppress, oppress and punish the people who protest against it,” he stressed.

The proposed concept states that an independent, domestic mechanism of truth seeking is identified as a meaningful way for Sri Lanka to advance and secure peace, after the country’s arduous journey of ending conflict of three decades. The Cabinet also authorised the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Justice to operationalise this concept and to initiate discussions and facilitate the drafting of a Truth and Reconciliation law. It is in support of this process, the current visit took place at the invitation of the South African Government.  During the visit, the two Ministers paid a Courtesy Call on the South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and held bilateral meetings with the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation of South Africa Naledi Pandoor and the Minister of Justice and Constitutional and Constitutional Development Ronald Lamola. They also met with former South African President Thabo Mbeki as well as Roelf Meyer, former Minister of Constitutional Development and one of the chief negotiators, along with President Ramaphosa, for the end of apartheid in South Africa and paving the way to the first democratic elections in the country. Meetings were also held with officials from the Public Prosecutions Office of South Africa, the Pan African Bar Association of South Africa, “Freedom park”, “In Transformation Initiative” and the “Institute for Justice and Reconciliation”.  During the call on President Ramaphosa, the South African President warmly recalled his friendship with President Wickremesinghe and said that he wishes to further consolidate the bilateral relations with Sri Lanka. He further stated that South Africa is committed to sharing their experiences in relation to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission with a view to assisting Sri Lanka in the reconciliation process.    Foreign Minister Sabry and Minister Pandoor exchanged views on important bilateral issues as well as the current situation in Sri Lanka. Minister Sabry especially briefed the South African Minister on the progress being made by the Government of Sri Lanka with regard to national efforts on reconciliation and the promotion and protection of human rights. While acknowledging that the South African model would need to be adapted to the Sri Lankan context, both Ministers agreed to work together in sharing experiences and expertise in developing the contours of a truth-seeking mechanism that would best suit the needs of the Sri Lankan people. The interactions with the South African Minister of Justice and other experts provided valuable insights with regard to the South African experience in the establishment of their Truth and Reconciliation Commission."

Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Hansamal Weerasuriya said yesterday (27) that four officials from the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) had been appointed to study the proposals, which had been submitted by the professional body and suggest solutions to the colossal issue which had the professional trade union from over 40 State and semi-government and private sector trade unions striking. Dr. Weerasuriya said that they saw this as a positive move by the government, although they have not made a noticeable move towards resolving the crisis issue, which had severely affected the professional categories since the implementation of the Inland Revenue Act (amended). He noted that the PTUA members had held a zoom meeting with the Washington Office of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week, while the unions had impressed upon the IMF the injustice in the way in which the professional categories were being taxed by the Government whilst shouldering the blame on to it. The GMOA Media Committee member warned that the PTUA would watch how the Government proceeds with resolving the tax issue and move into further trade union action should it fail to either amend the Act further or repeal it. With the IMF not being so explicitly keen on taxing professionals almost mercilessly, the Government cannot continue to blame the IMF for the present crisis. Further, if we are to save the country from a greater crisis in the near future, due to the shortage of doctors, financiers, engineers and other professional bodies, owing to the governments’ uncaring attitude, then the PTUA would do all things possible to push the Government into reverting its stance on the IR Act (Amended). Several Trade Unions of the PTUA called off their strike after the Presidential Secretariat wrote noting that the President and the Government were prepared to consider the proposals submitted by it in a positive light.        By Dilanthi Jayamanne "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/03/28/nbro-turns-out-fibre-paving-blocks-from-fabric-waste/,NBRO Turns Out Fibre Paving Blocks From Fabric Waste,Author not found,0,2023-03-27T20:30:00+00:00," What comes first and foremost to our minds about the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) is its prime roles such as landslide-related studies and research, mitigation and developing landslide resilience. Like any other nation, Sri Lanka, too, confronts natural calamities such as drought, floods as well as landslides accompanied by heavy rains. The role played by NBRO in identifying the landslide-prone locations in the Central Hill Country and its timely action to protect a large number of lives falling victim to such disasters should be lauded. The NBRO provides a tremendous and immeasurable service to resolve environment-related issues in Sri Lanka, predominantly to the apparel industry. The NBRO is a Semi-Government research institute established in 1984, currently functioning under the Defence Ministry engaging in landslide research studies while carrying out landslide mitigation work, developing landslide resilience and providing a timely warning to people in landslide-prone areas. Apart from the duties vested to it, the NBRO has been focusing towards providing a sustainable solution to the mounting apparel industry waste. The apparel industry is one of the major sectors which earns foreign exchange for the country. In 2021 the apparel industry contributed 44 per cent of the total export income while focusing on sustainable manufacturing processes. Due to not having textile waste recycling facilities in Sri Lanka the mounting textile waste has become a severe issue that needed to be resolved. The industry is taking various steps to resolve this issue. It is a compulsory and timely need to find a reliable and sustainable solution. The textile industry disposes of nearly 44,100 metric tons of off-cut textile waste per year.  A mass utilisation method is required to address this issue. The Building Materials Research and Testing Division (BMRTD) of NBRO has invented an effective and alternative mechanism to put an end to the textile waste issue by manufacturing a product utilising the waste material. It has manufactured fibre -reinforced paving blocks for outdoor sports surfaces as well as residential areas. The NBRO strives towards making a safe, sustaining and resilient environment through research and development activities while proving a timely solution to industrial problems. Fibre-reinforced paving block The fabric fibre reinforced paving block has been developed with many features such as improved shock absorption and water infiltration under the Research and Development (R & D) activities based on the request made by the textile industry to utilise the synthetic fibre blended fabric off-cuts as a value-added product. Research activities The research was carried out by Eng. G. K. B. Maheshi Gannoruwa at BMRTD under the supervision of Snr. Prof. S. M. A. Nanayakkara, University of Moratuwa. The NBRO had received the patent for this development under the Intellectual Property Act (IPA) of Sri Lanka. Throughout this research project Eng. (Dr.) Asiri Karunawardena, Director General of NBRO and Eng. Sunethra Muthurathne and the Director of BMRTD extended their fullest support and cooperation to successfully implement this project. Manufacturing process A huge amount of synthetic fibre mixed off-cuts disposed of by the apparel industry is being incinerated in cement kilns; Fabric off-cuts, cement, sand and other admixtures are used as raw materials to manufacture environmentally friendly paving blocks. The block consists of 26 per cent fabric content by volume and acts as reinforcement while improving the flexural properties of the block. Benefits The fibre-reinforced paving blocks have the capability to absorb 21 per cent ‘impact force’ when compared with the conventional concrete pavements while facilitating ‘better and healthy’ foot comfort for its users. In addition, these blocks have high skid resistance {80 Unpolished Slip Resistance Value (USRV}) to prevent accidents while moving in wet conditions. These blocks have water infiltration capacity and will facilitate the rainwater to reach the ground easily passing the blocks during a downpour. Technology These blocks have been manufactured according to the SLS 1425 Standards, fulfilling the specified requirements, for comprehensive strength abrasion resistance and skid resistance. Furthermore, these blocks also conform to the Splitting Tensile Strength (STS) requirements specified in BSEN 1338 standard while indicating its ‘strength result’ as 5.4N/mm2, a standard that is not attained by concrete paving blocks. High Quality As a deviation point from conventional paving block manufacturing methods, fabric fibres are used as the reinforcement to manufacture these blocks. Therefore, the durability of these paving blocks is especially evaluated; for their practical applicability and to ensure that fabric incorporated into the cement matrix is not subject to considerable deterioration during its performance. Fabric fibre-reinforced paving blocks are recommended for walking paths, jogging tracks, sports arenas, home gardens and children’s play areas due to improved shock absorption, water infiltration and skid resistance characteristics. The dimensions of a single block are 200mm in length, 100 mm in width and 60mm in height. As a pilot project 12,000 of these paving blocks have been laid on a jogging track located at Sri Lanka Light Infantry (SLLI), Panagoda. According to user comments, treading on these blocks facilitates better comfort for their feet, Eng. Maheshi Gannoruwa added. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/03/28/nbro-turns-out-fibre-paving-blocks-from-fabric-waste/,NBRO Turns Out Fibre Paving Blocks From Fabric Waste,Author not found,0,2023-03-27T20:30:00+00:00," What comes first and foremost to our minds about the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) is its prime roles such as landslide-related studies and research, mitigation and developing landslide resilience. Like any other nation, Sri Lanka, too, confronts natural calamities such as drought, floods as well as landslides accompanied by heavy rains. The role played by NBRO in identifying the landslide-prone locations in the Central Hill Country and its timely action to protect a large number of lives falling victim to such disasters should be lauded. The NBRO provides a tremendous and immeasurable service to resolve environment-related issues in Sri Lanka, predominantly to the apparel industry. The NBRO is a Semi-Government research institute established in 1984, currently functioning under the Defence Ministry engaging in landslide research studies while carrying out landslide mitigation work, developing landslide resilience and providing a timely warning to people in landslide-prone areas. Apart from the duties vested to it, the NBRO has been focusing towards providing a sustainable solution to the mounting apparel industry waste. The apparel industry is one of the major sectors which earns foreign exchange for the country. In 2021 the apparel industry contributed 44 per cent of the total export income while focusing on sustainable manufacturing processes. Due to not having textile waste recycling facilities in Sri Lanka the mounting textile waste has become a severe issue that needed to be resolved. The industry is taking various steps to resolve this issue. It is a compulsory and timely need to find a reliable and sustainable solution. The textile industry disposes of nearly 44,100 metric tons of off-cut textile waste per year.  A mass utilisation method is required to address this issue. The Building Materials Research and Testing Division (BMRTD) of NBRO has invented an effective and alternative mechanism to put an end to the textile waste issue by manufacturing a product utilising the waste material. It has manufactured fibre -reinforced paving blocks for outdoor sports surfaces as well as residential areas. The NBRO strives towards making a safe, sustaining and resilient environment through research and development activities while proving a timely solution to industrial problems. Fibre-reinforced paving block The fabric fibre reinforced paving block has been developed with many features such as improved shock absorption and water infiltration under the Research and Development (R & D) activities based on the request made by the textile industry to utilise the synthetic fibre blended fabric off-cuts as a value-added product. Research activities The research was carried out by Eng. G. K. B. Maheshi Gannoruwa at BMRTD under the supervision of Snr. Prof. S. M. A. Nanayakkara, University of Moratuwa. The NBRO had received the patent for this development under the Intellectual Property Act (IPA) of Sri Lanka. Throughout this research project Eng. (Dr.) Asiri Karunawardena, Director General of NBRO and Eng. Sunethra Muthurathne and the Director of BMRTD extended their fullest support and cooperation to successfully implement this project. Manufacturing process A huge amount of synthetic fibre mixed off-cuts disposed of by the apparel industry is being incinerated in cement kilns; Fabric off-cuts, cement, sand and other admixtures are used as raw materials to manufacture environmentally friendly paving blocks. The block consists of 26 per cent fabric content by volume and acts as reinforcement while improving the flexural properties of the block. Benefits The fibre-reinforced paving blocks have the capability to absorb 21 per cent ‘impact force’ when compared with the conventional concrete pavements while facilitating ‘better and healthy’ foot comfort for its users. In addition, these blocks have high skid resistance {80 Unpolished Slip Resistance Value (USRV}) to prevent accidents while moving in wet conditions. These blocks have water infiltration capacity and will facilitate the rainwater to reach the ground easily passing the blocks during a downpour. Technology These blocks have been manufactured according to the SLS 1425 Standards, fulfilling the specified requirements, for comprehensive strength abrasion resistance and skid resistance. Furthermore, these blocks also conform to the Splitting Tensile Strength (STS) requirements specified in BSEN 1338 standard while indicating its ‘strength result’ as 5.4N/mm2, a standard that is not attained by concrete paving blocks. High Quality As a deviation point from conventional paving block manufacturing methods, fabric fibres are used as the reinforcement to manufacture these blocks. Therefore, the durability of these paving blocks is especially evaluated; for their practical applicability and to ensure that fabric incorporated into the cement matrix is not subject to considerable deterioration during its performance. Fabric fibre-reinforced paving blocks are recommended for walking paths, jogging tracks, sports arenas, home gardens and children’s play areas due to improved shock absorption, water infiltration and skid resistance characteristics. The dimensions of a single block are 200mm in length, 100 mm in width and 60mm in height. As a pilot project 12,000 of these paving blocks have been laid on a jogging track located at Sri Lanka Light Infantry (SLLI), Panagoda. According to user comments, treading on these blocks facilitates better comfort for their feet, Eng. Maheshi Gannoruwa added. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

He was a natural-born leader who instinctively understood the hopes and aspirations of the people; he was close to the heartbeat of the nation. As a leader, he realised if he is too far ahead of his followers he would lose contact with them; on the other hand, if he was content with merely echoing the sentiments of his followers he would not be able to lead. He knew the right balance. Philip Gunawardena was largely instrumental in disseminating the idea of socialism in Sri Lanka. He did so in his unique way by de-Europeanising socialist thought and by connecting it to the wellsprings of indigenous culture and investing it with local resonances. He was able to speak in the cultural idiom of the people regarding issues that mattered most to them. Looking back on his efforts, one has to conclude that this was indeed the correct strategy. He was a proud and complex national leader. His pride grew out of his deep self-confidence to have abiding faith in ourselves. He was a complex man who realised that one has to engage manifold forces that impinge in any given historical moment and respond simultaneously to contradictory and unavoidable demands. He had his triumphs and defeats, unwavering loyalties and unanticipated betrayals. Through it all, he displayed his characteristic courage and force of personality as the Lion of Boralugoda. Philip Gunawardena’s manifold activities were guided by deep moral imagination. The idea of social justice was at the heart of it. He valued equality not as an end point, but rather the point of departure for social transformation. In this regard, I am reminded of the contemporary French thinker Jacques Rancière, who said, “Equality is not a goal to be achieved, but a point of departure, a supposition to be maintained in all circumstances”. One important facet of Philip Gunawardena’s thinking relates to this profound understanding of the dynamics of history. He saw clearly how history flows through us and shapes us; it was his belief that our discomfiture before the future grows out of our loss of historical identity. The capacity to grasp the complexity and many-sidedness of a historical situation marks off the enlightened leader from a less enlightened one. And he certainly was an enlightened leader. Devising ways of channelling the energy of the past towards the momentum of the present was one of his preoccupations. Philip Gunawardena, despite his occasional setbacks, was an optimist at heart. This optimism flowed from his belief that the future will embrace the historical aspirations we bring to it. Hence, a true understanding of Philip Gunawardena as a thinker and leader demands that we pay close attention to his distinct historical imagination. Philip Gunawardena’s voice gave new urgency to the aspirations of the nation in search of a better world; that search was animated by the effort to rediscover the cultural identity and national self-respect that were shattered under colonialism. He unleashed a new yearning for social betterment, cultural growth and national self-understanding. Philip Gunawardena was a patriot and national leader who had the ability to feel into the lives of the people, his recognition of the force of culture, his leadership qualities and his endeavours to restore the moral supremacy of the nation. The 51st Commemoration of National Hero, the late Philip Gunawardena, will be held at the Jasmine Room of the BMICH, Colombo 7, on 29 March at 3:45 p.m., chaired by Mahanayake of the Kalyani Chapter, Most Venerable Malwane Panngasara Nayaka Thera. Keynote speakers are Vice Chancellor of Uva-Wellassa University, Prof. Jayantha Lal Ratnasekera and Art Historian and International Award-winning Film-MakerDr. SinhaRaja Tammita-Delgoda.

We will liberalise the economy further. There are those who think liberalisation is not a good word. And we will open it out for foreign investors.  We are also looking at different areas of investment in manufacturing but that means we have to go into higher end. Secondly, modernising agriculture and fisheries, making Sri Lanka a regional logistics centre, upgrading and expanding our tourism,” the President made this remark during a discussion with media organisation heads at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday (23). The President also said, the Government intends to take necessary action to pass the best Anti-Corruption Act in South Asia in Parliament shortly. He said this in response to questions on how to ensure fiscal discipline and fiscal transparency when it comes to utilising IMF money. Stressing that the previous IMF agreements failed 16 times due to people’s perceptions, particularly due to the media and that the 17th time can be successful if the Government can get the media’s support. “The IMF process is tough. This cannot be done in a hurry. It is a four-year process. We cannot engage in political games like before. We need to forget the mistakes we made in the past and we must get together to come out of this crisis,” he added. “I asked Parliament to give approval for the IMF agreement. I don’t require it by law. But Parliament voting for this agreement will strengthen it. The country has already voted for it. At least that’s what the reactions I have. And, I would like to get the assistance of Parliament. “It is also necessary to show the creditors that the country has accepted the principle which is included in this IMF agreement. Firstly, it’s the restructuring of the debt. But, that is not limited to restructuring of the debt. It is restructuring our economy.  “We are moving towards a new Sri Lanka. By 2048 we will be a high middle income country. We cannot go on with stagnation and low growth. We just remember that all upheavals we had in the country relate back to this issue. We had one in 1971, which was related to unemployment, 1980s one was not mainly on language, but that the Tamil youth had no employment. Same thing happened in 1989. We have the ability to start anew. So, this is a historic process,” he said. Responding to the question of alleged attempts to suppress media freedom, the President said, “I was the one who removed criminal defamation law. And, I was the one to introduce the Right to Information Act. I also brought independent commissions to Parliament on three different occasions. Why would I suppress media freedom?” In response to why the Government is divesting five State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), some of which are not loss-making, President Wickremesinghe queried back. “Not all SOEs are loss-making. But, we must repay our debts. Therefore, we must restructure.  Why is the Government getting involved in businesses? That is not part of the Government mandate. There was no such during the times of D.S. Senanayake. We had enough money to fund the Gal Oya Development Project. Now we seek loans from China to build the Moragahakanda Project. In which country where there’s a law saying all assets should be owned by the Government?” “Who earns through these State Enterprises? Is it the country? There is no responsibility. What we aim for is accelerated development. It’s only us that want to keep all of these. India has even sold their airports. They were anyway making profits. We also must go there. The Government is there to provide State services, protecting law and order, solving problems of the people. Do we have a good education system today? We have spent more money on petroleum than on education last year. We either look ahead like the developed nations or fall behind like North Korea,” he said."

Ports are a crucial part of our economy. Is this what a trade union is supposed to do? They are trying to topple the Government by turning away ships.” “In the past, we had a huge respect for the teachers. Now the trade unionists, like Stalin, are damaging that image. Why is he playing with the future of the children? Parents struggle much to send their children to school. “Same thing applies to the university education. This is done by so called students’ unions. These student union leaders are in universities for about 10 years without graduating. This is a very dangerous situation. “We have to take steps to manage the IMF financial assistance we obtained. Those who claim that they became independent during the tenure of Gotabaya Rajapaksa told not to go to the IMF at that time. But now they are ridiculing this Government saying they are watching how the Government is going to manage the IMF financial assistance. The Opposition made similar predictions all the time and all of them were wrong.” “The Opposition even said that IMF would not support Sri Lanka without holding the election. But that did not happen. Thanks to President Ranil Wickremesinghe we were able to win. We also thank Minister Ali Sabry. “Everyone is now pointing fingers at President Ranil Wickremesinghe. But he accept the responsibility of rebuilding country. We stopped unnecessary expenditure. “The President has won the trust of international community. To gain their trust it is not necessary to hold elections. We have to bring a proper election system and all the 225 MPs should get together for that purpose.”"

Addressing the media in view of the ‘National Tuberculosis Day’ she noted that the disease could be completely cured if detected and treated early. Dr. Pallewatte said, at least seven per cent of the patients diagnosed with the disease succumb to it.  That amounts to about 500 to 600 patients, diagnosed with the disease, die of it. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the disease and seek treatment as early as possible.      Dr. Mizya Cader of the NPTCCD said, Southeast Asian countries bore 43% of the world’s TB burden. While Maldives has the least number of TB patients and Sri Lanka is just above that country as the island did not have such a large TB burden. In 2022, there were 8,342 patients detected in Sri Lanka. When considered from 2016, the number of cases detected annually swayed between 8,000 and 9,000. But the number of patients being detected plummeted in 2020 and 2021 -during height of Covid-19, she explained. In 2020, there were 7,700 patients detected with tuberculosis, while in 2021 only 6,700 patients were identified. But by 2022 the patient numbers increased and reached the 2019 level, she explained. “We also have continuously said that there were an estimated 4,000 TB patients that have gone undetected. But that is due to the WHO estimations,” Dr. Cadre elaborated. They have estimated that Sri Lanka should be able to detect 63 TB cases for 100 000 of the population. in 2022 we have only detected 36.6 patients for every 100 000 of the population, Dr. Cader said. There is about a 5,000 difference between the estimated amount and the numbers that were detected that year.  She observed that should WHO estimations be accurate the NPTCC would need public support to detect these numbers that have been overlooked in order to treat them owing to the stigma and censure that the disease faced.

He outlined eight missions for science-based action for a water secure future, to be collaboratively achieved with other stakeholders. Bonnie Horbach, Ambassador for the Netherlands urged for cohesive action that ‘went beyond promises, stating that climate change and water issues transcend boundaries acutely affecting many countries, including the Netherlands.’  She encouraged participants to share knowledge and expertise to achieve imperative changes for a secure planet. The dialogue had participants from all sectors who had opportunity for an interactive discussion with the speakers and an eminent panel comprising Ms. Priyanka Dissanayake of the World Bank, Leel Randeni, Director Climate Change Secretariat of Sri Lanka and IWMI’s Dr. Nishadi Eriyagama. The UN 2023 Water Conference will be held from 22- 24 March in New York and aims to bring about firm commitments to deliver on water actions in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  These actions will also contribute towards outcomes of  COP28."

Last Monday, Julie Chung, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, visited Susamayawardhana Vidyalaya in Borella, to observe the progress of the project and experience how children and educators in Sri Lanka engage with educational technology. Brandix Lanka Limited, Director, Ajit Johnpillai, said: “Education is the most powerful tool to enrich communities and futures, and Brandix is committed to build a strong foundation for transformational learning for students across Sri Lanka. The progress we have made with Right ToRead over the past two years is promising, and the potential for change in the education sector, harnessing such digital technologies is immeasurable. Brandix will continue its commitment to deliver Inspired Solutions for the people of Sri Lanka.” Susamayawardhana Vidyalaya was one of the first schools connected with RightToRead, and the visitors toured the smart classroom constructed by Brandix, to support the school’s journey in reaping the benefits of English proficiency. As technology infrastructure and resources are limited, Brandix will also provide interactive smartboards to 10,194 schools across the country to give students access to the ReadToMe programme. The programme aims to touch the lives of over 4 million students in Sri Lanka. Brandix has already installed smartboards at 1,260 schools across the island, connecting over 790,000 students."

Inaugurating the meeting, Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane highlighted the importance of the IORA as a forum to enhance maritime cooperation in the Indian Ocean region. On the area of Maritime Safety and Security, the topic under discussion at the Colombo Working Group, Wijewardane said the growing importance of the Indian Ocean requires awareness among IORA Member States on related issues as well as of agreed principles and regulatory frameworks.a “The Indian Ocean Rim region faces many traditional and non-traditional safety and security challenges including piracy, armed robberies at sea, transnational organised crime such as human smuggling, human trafficking and drug trafficking, as well as illicit trafficking in wildlife, IUU fishing, ocean pollution, over-exploitation of marine resources, and illegal transport of hazardous material. Climate change and destruction of ocean biodiversity also challenge the safety and security of the Indian Ocean. Critical infrastructure connected to the ocean which is physically, digitally and environmentally vulnerable needs to be protected.” Furthermore, she said Sri Lanka will assume the Chair of IORA in the latter half of this year for the period from 2023-2025. In this role, Sri Lanka will build on the important work done by Bangladesh as the present Chair and the UAE as the past Chair.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Addressing the Cabinet media briefing yesterday (21), Gunawardena said after obtaining financial assistance, past Governments failed to adhere to the conditions they pledged to fulfil. If that happens this time too, the country will face a grave disaster, he said. He said President Ranil Wickremesinghe has clearly stated that the full agreement with the IMF will be presented to Parliament. “We have deceived the IMF 16 times before this, by not acting in accordance with the conditions we agreed upon. If this happens again, the country will sink deeper into the abyss. As a result, I believe it is critical to focus on building a national consensus on working in accordance with the IMF programme rather than working to fulfil other political agendas,” he said. Furthermore, Gunawardena said it is his personal opinion that those political parties opposed to the IMF deal can present their alternative suggestions and potential solutions to Parliament, where those proposals can be debated and approved. “My personal idea is that whoever opposes the agreement the Sri Lankan Government is signing with IMF, should come up with their proposals without only criticising the agreement. I would even consider holding a referendum on this,” he said. When asked if the Government is receiving a financial assistance of Rs 9 billion or Rs 3 billion, he responded that there is no agreement on the financial assistance. “The IMF loan will be received as an assurance regarding the country’s economic stabilisation. This will aid in receiving other loans, such as those from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank,” he elaborated. BY Thameenah Razeek"

Founded in 2004, Enviro Water Systems provides solutions for innovative water management that enhance reliability while ensuring lower energy consumption and maintenance costs. The company is a provider of state-of-the-art technology using world-renowned brands and also is a reliable after sales service partner. The World Water Day 2023 campaign, called “Be the change”, encourages people across the globe to take action in their own lives to change the way they use, consume and manage water. Although 71% of the Earth is covered in water, the majority of it is salt water and only 3% is fresh water. Only 1% of it is usable and 2% is ice and glaciers. Sri Lanka is known to be a land that is blessed with an abundance of water resources. However, in recent years there have been regular water scarcities in several parts of the island due to spatial and temporal variations in rainfall and changing weather patterns. There are also areas where there is insufficient water throughout the year while in some areas, there is water available but it’s not safe for consumption. Overall, it is clear that the availability of water in Sri Lanka is not necessarily the primary concern. The core water security issues lie in its management as studies have shown that over 50% of the country’s rainfall goes to the sea and is not utilized at all. Every year, Sri Lankans have to undergo numerous water cuts during dry seasons. To be better equipped to face this situation it is best to reduce the need by changing the way is used, consumed and managed. This helps in reducing the consumption habit in short term and saving water over the long term. Daily habits at home can be modified to reduce water consumption. Leaving the tap open when brushing teeth or shaving and letting the water run when soaping up in the shower wastes large amounts of water daily. As a result, a household with four adults can waste as much as 12 units of water per month. On the other hand, by introducing a little cleaning kitchen water and bath water can be reused for gardening and flushing toilets. By changing these bad habits, water consumption can be cut down and the water bill reduced. Additionally, the government’s expenditure on water treatment can be reduced thereby helping the economy of the country. It is also important to introduce mechanisms to reduce the use of fresh water in industries and introduce mandatory regulations for reuse of wastewater and promote those industries. Enviro Water Systems portfolio of solutions includes water treatment, sewage treatment, waste water treatment, water treatment chemicals and preventive maintenance. The company’s objective is to go beyond providing of waste water management solutions but also assurance of its premier quality of treated water. By using the expertise of its qualified, hands on, and experienced professionals, it is able to deliver high quality, cutting edge, cost effective and environmentally friendly technological solutions for customers by understanding their needs individually."

In a special statement yesterday (21), the President said, “The IMF has certified that Sri Lanka is capable of restructuring its debt. Sri Lanka will no longer be treated as a bankrupt country.” Normal economic activities can resume with this assurance. As our foreign exchange situation improves, the restrictions placed on imports will be gradually lifted, he said. The President said that essential goods, medicines and goods related to the tourism industry will be included in the first round. He expressed his gratitude to all countries that helped Sri Lanka to finalise the deal, including the heads of the IMF.  Right after the news that IMF approved an extended arrangement under the EFF on Monday (20) night, the President said, “In the 75 years of Sri Lanka’s independence, there has never been a more critical period for our economic future.  Our official creditors have declared their support, following continuous and positive engagements over the last few months and we are pleased that the IMF Executive Board approved our programme, enabling Sri Lanka to access up to USD 7 billion in funding from the IMF and IFIs. From the very start, we committed to full transparency in all our discussions with financial institutions and with our creditors. I express my gratitude to the IMF and our international partners for their support, as we look to get the economy back on track for the long term through prudent fiscal management and our ambitious reform agenda. “Since taking office last July, it has been my priority to stabilise Sri Lanka’s economy and achieve sustainable levels of debt,” the President said. “To do so, we have taken some tough decisions, but we did so with a commitment to widening our social safety nets, protecting the vulnerable, rooting out corruption and ensuring we can grow an inclusive and internationally attractive economy. The IMF programme is critical in achieving this vision for our country, and we are committed to successfully completing the IMF programme and achieving debt sustainability. We will continue to engage with all our creditors, and I encourage both our bilateral and commercial creditors to strengthen and foster coordination in the context of our forthcoming engagement. The IMF programme will also be imperative to improving Sri Lanka’s standing in and access to international capital markets and it will demonstrate that Sri Lanka is once again a country attractive to talent, investors and tourists.” Sri Lanka reached a Staff-Level Agreement with the IMF on a four-year programme, supported by the Extended Fund Facility on 1 September 2022. The programme, amounting to USD 3 billion, is expected to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability while protecting vulnerable groups and safeguarding Sri Lanka’s financial system. Since September, the Government of Sri Lanka has held official creditor meetings to update stakeholders on the country’s reform agenda and share information transparently as well as engaging with commercial creditors. Following the IMF Executive Board approval, the disbursement of the first tranche under this programme is expected to take place in the coming days. (NV)"

Chanaka said yesterday (21) in Parliament. “There is a clear conspiracy to use the dollars we receive from tourists and Sri Lankan citizens employed in foreign countries for illegal acts. It is clear now that certain people used the ‘Aragalaya’ for undiyal transactions and to bring drugs into the country,” he alleged. The MP claimed, “Billions of dollars are being used to bring drugs into the country. We earn foreign currency mainly through tourism and foreign remittances, Now we can see that certain people who spoke on behalf of leaders of ‘Aragalaya’ are representing drug kingpins. They are going to the Courts to represent drug lords and at the same time they give ‘advice’ to appoint the next IGP.”  “Now we have a question. Should we appoint the IGP according to the instructions of ‘Harak Kata,’ who is the most famous drug kingpin in Sri Lanka at present? Are these lawyers representing the views of ‘Harak Kata’? This is nothing but a conspiracy. ‘Aragalaya’ is a conspiracy. The dollars received by our country are being used to bring drugs from foreign countries.” “Therefore, we request both the President and the Minister of Public Security to launch a probe to find out whether the dollars received are utilised through our banking system in a legal manner. It is okay if a separate Police unit is set up for that purpose. We have imposed restrictions on imports. If we utilise the foreign currency we have properly, then there would not be a gap between imports and exports. There would be no problem in running the country. We can import fuel, coal and other essential items without any problem.” “It should be mentioned that no leaders in this country would appoint the IGP according to the instructions of drug lords. Therefore, I request all the State officials and the Opposition not to support such types of sinister attempts.” “Another thing. There is a discussion on holding elections. I would like to say that except for former Premier Mahinda Rajapaksa, the rest of the 224 MPs do not have a right to speak about this matter. I can give you plenty of examples of how these people including the JVP postponed elections from 2015 to 2018. The JVP says they were not aware of that. Are they babies? The same goes for members of the ‘Helicopter’ alliance. The election which was scheduled to be held last year was postponed. Some members of the ‘Helicopter’ alliance were ministers at that time.  How can they speak about holding elections then? All of them got together to postpone the elections at that time and now they want to hold the election for their own political gains.” “These are not the real problems of ordinary citizens. The real problems are increased fuel prices, increased electrify bills and increased commodity prices. The Government is working to resolve these burning issues. We will go for an election after stabilising the country. The Opposition always said this Government is not democratic. They said we will not get IMF assistance because the Government is not following democratic principles. We have now obtained the IMF assistance. It shows that the whole world accepts that the Government is following democratic principles.”"

Chanaka said yesterday (21) in Parliament. “There is a clear conspiracy to use the dollars we receive from tourists and Sri Lankan citizens employed in foreign countries for illegal acts. It is clear now that certain people used the ‘Aragalaya’ for undiyal transactions and to bring drugs into the country,” he alleged. The MP claimed, “Billions of dollars are being used to bring drugs into the country. We earn foreign currency mainly through tourism and foreign remittances, Now we can see that certain people who spoke on behalf of leaders of ‘Aragalaya’ are representing drug kingpins. They are going to the Courts to represent drug lords and at the same time they give ‘advice’ to appoint the next IGP.”  “Now we have a question. Should we appoint the IGP according to the instructions of ‘Harak Kata,’ who is the most famous drug kingpin in Sri Lanka at present? Are these lawyers representing the views of ‘Harak Kata’? This is nothing but a conspiracy. ‘Aragalaya’ is a conspiracy. The dollars received by our country are being used to bring drugs from foreign countries.” “Therefore, we request both the President and the Minister of Public Security to launch a probe to find out whether the dollars received are utilised through our banking system in a legal manner. It is okay if a separate Police unit is set up for that purpose. We have imposed restrictions on imports. If we utilise the foreign currency we have properly, then there would not be a gap between imports and exports. There would be no problem in running the country. We can import fuel, coal and other essential items without any problem.” “It should be mentioned that no leaders in this country would appoint the IGP according to the instructions of drug lords. Therefore, I request all the State officials and the Opposition not to support such types of sinister attempts.” “Another thing. There is a discussion on holding elections. I would like to say that except for former Premier Mahinda Rajapaksa, the rest of the 224 MPs do not have a right to speak about this matter. I can give you plenty of examples of how these people including the JVP postponed elections from 2015 to 2018. The JVP says they were not aware of that. Are they babies? The same goes for members of the ‘Helicopter’ alliance. The election which was scheduled to be held last year was postponed. Some members of the ‘Helicopter’ alliance were ministers at that time.  How can they speak about holding elections then? All of them got together to postpone the elections at that time and now they want to hold the election for their own political gains.” “These are not the real problems of ordinary citizens. The real problems are increased fuel prices, increased electrify bills and increased commodity prices. The Government is working to resolve these burning issues. We will go for an election after stabilising the country. The Opposition always said this Government is not democratic. They said we will not get IMF assistance because the Government is not following democratic principles. We have now obtained the IMF assistance. It shows that the whole world accepts that the Government is following democratic principles.”"

This was after news broke that the IMF had approved the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to bail out Sri Lanka. In a tweet, the CBSL said it is key to ensuring a sustainable exit from the country’s crisis, securing long-term growth, and investing in human and economic development. Following the IMF approval, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa tweeted that IMF assistance to Sri Lanka is necessary and welcomed it. “It should now be combined with a plan: to reduce corruption, support the poor and increase economic growth. Governance reform, listening to the voice of the people, and a global outlook will be the ingredients of success,” he tweeted. On the approval of the bailout, SJP MP Dr. Harsha de Silva tweeted “relieved” and appreciated President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s commitment to get the job done.    “Notwithstanding our political differences, the professionalism of the Government and the CBSL in the process must be commended,” he said. He further said, “If the previous members (lot) did this in 2020, our people would not have suffered this way. We could have come out with much less pain. Their arrogance and greed finally bankrupted us. Let’s look forward. Debt restructuring will be hard. Reform is the key,” and added that a sustainable solution is to break down walls and build bridges to the world. The European Union (EU) Office in Colombo tweeted that it welcomed the IMF Executive Board’s approval and thanked the creditors including the EU Member States for working together to help Sri Lankans. Meanwhile, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung said her government welcomes the approval of Sri Lanka’s IMF package. “It’s great news and an important step on the road toward economic recovery. The Government of SL will need to continue reforms and conclude debt restructuring agreements to ensure the programme – and the economy – stay on track,” she said. She added that structural and lasting reforms that address good governance and transparency are critical to ensure all citizens of Sri Lanka can prosper. The IMF said its Board approved a 48-month extended arrangement under the EFF of SDR 2.286 billion (about USD 3 billion) to support Sri Lanka’s economic policies and reforms and the objectives of the EFF-supported programme are to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, safeguarding financial stability, and stepping up structural reforms to unlock Sri Lanka’s growth potential. To the IMF Board, tackling corruption should continue, including revamping anti-corruption legislation. They said a more comprehensive anti-corruption reform agenda should be guided by the ongoing IMF governance diagnostic mission that conducts an assessment of Sri Lanka’s anti-corruption and governance framework. IMF Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Masahiro Nozaki added that they also noted that they do not intervene in local election processes and that the IMF has never recommended postponing Local Government (LG) Elections in Sri Lanka.   By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The residential workshop was a knowledge and experience sharing field visit organised as part of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC), Empress Shoken Fund-funded Ground Water Recharging for Disaster Preparedness Project, which is being executed by the Kurunegala Branch of SLRCS. The programme commenced at the SLRCS Kurunegala Branch training hall with an introduction to the organisation, Climate Change Adaptation (CCA), Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), and the Ground Water Recharging for Disaster Preparedness Project. In the initial discussion, the students were separated into three groups: agriculture engineering, soil and agriculture, and social science aspects. The students were instructed to gather information and uncover results with a preference for their chosen groups, and to submit their findings at the end of the residential workshop. On their field trip in Galgamuwa, the students spoke with villagers and beneficiaries, while SLRCS resource personnel accompanied the students to raise awareness about groundwater recharging linked to CCA and DRR. The students enjoyed, while learning far more than they could have imagined. As discussed at the initial stage, the students presented their findings with great enthusiasm at the Irrigation Training Institute (ITI) in Galgamuwa, using PowerPoint presentations, videos, and discussions. The students’ communication and analytical skills based on their findings were greatly appreciated by the resource personnel and staff of SLRCS. The Ground Water Recharging for Disaster Preparedness Project is developing 65 homesteads in the Ihala Palukadewa region, with 42 of them now running extremely effectively. These home gardens could be used to assess the success and feasibility of the project’s groundwater recharge technologies. The project’s positive influence on people’s mindsets, as well as the rise in soil moisture level owing to groundwater recharge, is strongly represented in these existing homesteads. The project’s indirect advantage is that it will help to alleviate the present economic crisis and food shortages. Branch Executive Officer of the Kurunegala Branch of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, Sarath Wickramasinghe said: “It was a pleasure to work on the project with the Faculty of Agriculture at the UoP. My team has worked relentlessly via the project for a better environment for the people. One of the key goals of the project is to raise awareness and capacity, and being able to interact with students is confirmation that the project’s execution is in good hands, since they represent the future of this specific industry. We are excited to continue working together to help Sri Lankan communities thrive in the future.”"

The Government has approved the appropriate Cabinet document, which states that shares in the listed State-run firms, such as Sri Lanka Telecom and Lanka Hospitals, must be sold on the Colombo Stock Exchange. In this regard, Sri Lanka Telecom and Lanka Hospitals have informed the Colombo Stock Exchange that the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance has already communicated the Cabinet decision to them. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) are presently revising internal guidelines and amending listing requirements to allow SOEs to be listed in the CSE, Manil Jayesinghe, country managing partner at EY Sri Lanka & the Maldives and Chairperson of the SEC-CSE joint committee for new products, told Finance Today. “Once this structure is in place, SOEs will be able to readily enter the capital market for fundraising, and the public will be able to become owners of SOEs,” he added. Moreover, this will help encourage attempts to restructure SOEs. The Sri Lankan Government has also established a fully government-owned holding company to accelerate the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), reform process under the supervision of newly formed SOE restructuring unit. Specifically, “as mentioned by the government in this year’s budget,” SriLankan Airlines, Sri Lanka Telecom, Colombo Hilton, Waters Edge, and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC), along with their subsidiaries will be restructured and sold as a first step. “The money from this will be used to strengthen the country’s foreign exchange reserves and the value of the rupee,” sources said. On 21 September last year, Finance Today exclusively reported, that the government is prepared to undertake changes in the airline, telecom, insurance, and hotel sectors. The money from this will be used to strengthen the country’s foreign exchange reserves and the value of the rupee.  Sri Lanka Telecom is already a listed company, and Malaysia’s UT Group already owns 49%. Reports say that they are ready to sell their shares if State ownership falls into the hands of another investor. Sri Lanka Insurance is a former private company that was taken over by the government following a Court case. It has a value of over 500 million dollars, and the government hopes to get between USD 3-4 billion by giving these government firms to the private sector. The Insurance Corporation, which also has controlling stakes in the listed Lanka Hospital, Litro Gas Lanka, and the Grand Hyatt Colombo, owns Canwill Holdings (Private) Limited. The Colombo Hilton is owned by Hotel Developers, and is estimated to be worth around USD 100-115 million.

The Writ Application on behalf of ‘Kudu Salindu’ was filed by his mother on the basis that there is imminent danger to his life and that he should be produced before Court. They argued that Madush’s wife wrote to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), the Director of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) and the Red Cross, urging immediate intervention to protect the life of her husband.

Chung made the announcement during a visit to the Guruaragama Primary School, Embilipitiya, to observe a school feeding programme supported by the United States Government’s assistance.  The Ambassador met teachers and parents as well as schoolchildren as she toured the school’s classrooms. “This is the second school I’ve visited in a week that is receiving food assistance from the United States, last week I was at St. John’s Maha Vidyalaya in Colombo North where USAID is working with the World Food Programme to support a USD 7 million school feeding programme,” she said. In partnership with Save The Children and alongside the Sri Lankan Government and local communities, USDA/FAS is implementing the ‘Promoting Autonomy, Literacy, and Attentiveness through Market Alliances (PALAM/A) project in Sri Lanka.  This USD 27.5 million initiative began providing food shipments at the height of the pandemic and will be completed this year.  The project, which includes monitoring and oversight provisions, improves literacy and nutrition while reducing short-term hunger of school-age children. Since 2021, USDA food aid has provided protein supplements using yellow split peas and Alaskan pink salmon to over 95,000 children in 835 primary schools distributed over seven districts (Nuwara-Eliya, Badulla, Moneragala, Ratnapura, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, and Trincomalee), it added. More broadly, the United States Government has provided food assistance to nearly two million Sri Lankan schoolchildren over the past year.

The Sri Lanka Police was constitutionally formed on 3 September 1866 while its anniversary is annually marked on 21 March. When perusing historical data concerning the demise of Police Officers on duty, one of the most significant sources of information is related to the construction of a memorial statue on the Colombo-Kandy road at the Mawanella Police Division. The memorial statue had been built by District Agent E. R. Saunders in memory of PC Saban. PC Saban had been killed in attempting to arrest Uthuwankande Saradiyel on 21 March 1864 which was 24-months prior to the constitutional setting up of the Police Department Saban had succumbed to injuries after being gunned down by Mammale Marikkar, an accomplice of Saradiyel,. The next Police Officer to follow suit was PC No. 289 K. Thmabimuttu who had been killed in the Borella Police Division in 1894. Subsequently various Police officers from different ranks had sacrificed their lives in the performance of their duty such as tackling of crime, prevention of accidents, ensuring reduction of vice and maintenance of law and order. According to data, a total of 3,143 Police officers had died on duty. While a total of 1,567 officers had been rendered disabled while on duty. So far the Government has provided relief to members of the families of Police officers who had perished on duty and for those disabled while on duty and the Government has implemented a programme to provide compensation to family members and relatives. Furthermore, the Government has decided to give prominence to children of Police officers who die on duty when admitting children to State schools and to financially look after parents of unmarried Police officers who had died due to terror activities while on duty before 19 May 2009.  "

Led by swap settlements between the GoSL and Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), contracted liquidity by Rs 250,517 million (USD 742.73 million)  yesterday. Conversions are based on Thursday’s (16 March) administered ‘spot’ value which was Rs 327.29 to the US dollar. Consequently market’s net shortfall increased by 524.43 per cent (Rs 264,461 million) toRs 214,033 million yesterday. Swaps between GoSL and CBSL are foreign reserves neutral. MP, coupled with being the steward of the country’s foreign reserves and of its debt is the exclusive prerogative of the CBSL. CBSL which administers daily ‘OMO’ (open market operations) lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot.’ The  ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and to lower the cost of ‘essential’ imports like medicines and energy imports which are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee as Sri Lanka is an import dependent economy. Issuing of T Bills and T Bonds is a popular way GoSL raises money domestically to meet its local commitments. Investing in T Bills and T Bonds is generally considered as being riskless, because, in the event GoSL is unable to repay such debt, CBSL is normally mandated to print demand pull inflationary money and repay such creditors.   BY Paneetha Ameresekere"

The idea of establishing a South Africa-style truth and reconciliation commission, to look into atrocities during the war against terrorism, was first mooted by the late Minister Mangala Samaraweera in 2015, when the ‘Good-governance’ Government was elected.

Meanwhile, he said new debts would arise and the Government would then have to borrow money because the annual foreign exchange earnings were insufficient to meet needs such as importing fuel and fertiliser. The President said there was a balance of payment which means that foreign earnings were less than the money that must be spent to purchase the needs from abroad. The President was addressing the 32nd Interact District Conference held at Temple Trees yesterday (19). “Secondly, how do we stabilise the Rupee? Compared to the Dollar the Rupee has now gone up to Rs 300. Once we have this agreement with the IMF, the Rupee will gradually come down to Rs 200 or Rs 185. Now we have a period of stabilisation and that is four years. We have agreed with the IMF, they have given us targets to achieve. We have agreed that the budget will not be a deficit and that the budget will have a surplus by 2026, and that we will then be able to pay back the money that we borrowed. Now that is not a very good situation. Once we stabilise the economy and we can restructure the debts, we must also find a means of paying off all our debts and coming to a situation where we have a surplus in the country; every year, like Japan, Singapore, Germany, or Korea. At the end of the day, we must have a surplus. Our foreign exchange earnings must exceed our requirements but for the time being we have to import fuel, medicine, and certain other basic foodstuff. So that is the next stage,” he said. Speaking further he said “In order to win this encounter, stabilising the economy alone was not enough. You must make the economy grow. Unless you make the economy grow, we will go down again. “As far as I am concerned, we have not only to lay the groundwork but also to restructure our debt, to stabilize our economy, so that we can repay our debt in ten years’ time. In order to build the new economy in which we will be prosperous, and we will also be able to become a developed economy giving a better future for those who will be living in the next 40-50 years, I need a team. When I lay that plan down, I need a team for that match”. That is going to be the big match. We have to decide whether we are going or make it, whether we are going to develop the country or whether we are going to let it slide. For that game who is my team? My team is going to be all of you. What we will lay down now, is the 25-year plan,” he said. The President also pointed out that by 2049, there will be a prosperous Nation. He said Sri Lanka will be like the people in Malaysia and the people in some of the European countries. “We will have no debt, and more than that, each of you will have earned at least a few thousand dollars a month or maybe more. Now I say, each of you because, during the next 25 years all of you; the oldest here will be 45. You will not even be 50. Some will be less. It is your future that we have to talk of. Unless I stabilise the economy, we cannot develop as a country to become a prosperous society. Once we stabilise the economy, we can go ahead to develop the country. Some of you might be thinking of going abroad for education. I understand the difficulty of getting into universities here and the problems you face in the universities. Some of you might be thinking of going abroad and leaving Sri Lanka. Some of you may be thinking of going abroad to work and coming back. All I want to say to all those who are thinking of going abroad is not to abandon the country. In the next two years, you will see the country developing and then you will see that you have a future. This is a 25-year match. The second innings will be much longer than the first innings. The first innings is only four years, second will be 21 years after that,” he said. He said it is a must to become the most prosperous country in our region, not have poverty, to have employment, to have a green economy, to have a s-economy, to be modern in technology and modern in thinking. “There has to be a very marked change in the way the county is governed. That is what you call a system change. We must have that system change thinking of the Interactors here. What is the country you want? What is the society you want? What are the changes you want? In that case, you have to participate in building that country. Because you will finally take over the leadership. So what you have been trained here is not merely to run the road trip. But every one of you in different ways will help to build the country and hopefully run the country and some of you, I hope will be able to come forward as Rotarians and make the speech that I have been making today. So I don’t want to take any more of your time, but I wish you all the best in your future endeavours and wish the Interact all the best,” he said. Meanwhile, the President emphasised that the Royal College cricket team’s effective captaincy ultimately led to the team’s victory at a time when all of the matches were being lost and that his effort was to lift the defeated country to the path of victory similar to what the captain of the Royal College cricket team did. The President recalled that when he assumed office last July, the country was experiencing numerous crises such as shortage of fuel, food, and fertiliser. He compared this to the Royal team, which had suffered a string of defeats, and claimed that many people believed the country would not be able to recover. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed that his team was able to change that situation and create economic stability in the country in the last seven months and emphasised that Sri Lanka is no longer a bankrupt state. He said that everyone would be able to witness a  developing country in the next two years, and to make Sri Lanka the most prosperous country in the region, it is necessary to build the economy in addition to stabilising it today. The President added that the 25-year plan to make Sri Lanka a successful nation by 2048 has already been implemented and it can only be achieved with the commitment of the current youth. This conference was organised by S. Thomas’ College, Wesley College, Visakha Vidyalaya, and Girls’ High School, Kandy and drew about 700 students from various schools across the island. President  Wickremesinghe was welcomed by the Chairperson of the 32nd Interact District Conference, Abdullah Siddeek who delivered the welcome speech. Appreciating his support and participation in the Interact Global Youth Movement, District Governor of the Rotary International District 3220 for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Pubudu De Zoysa presented a memento to the President and Interact District Conference President Abdullah Siddeek presented the President with a plaque. Speaking Further the President also said: “Your District Governor was worried that I may not turn up here today after the Royal-Thomian Match yesterday. I want to tell her that the match was over yesterday, and a new day begins today. It was, I must say, an interesting match and I must commend both the Royal and the St. Thomas teams. In a way, it’s training in leadership for the Captains of both sides, as well as those who will be playing next year. How do you prepare for a match, how do you work together with your coach, how do you try to win the match and how do you prevent losing a match. This is what you have to go into. Well, yesterday was a decisive day instead of being a draw unlike previous Royal- Thomian matches. There was an outcome. As for the Thomians, they have to study why they lost. Why royal won. What are the weaknesses in your strategies and how can you win the D.S. Senanayake shield next year. So that itself is a test in leadership. For Royal College, and especially its Captain, it is another test. Having lost many matches, first, how do you prevent a defeat and second, how do you win. So instead of looking at how to prevent a defeat, he decided to go for victory. It was good leadership and I must commend him for turning a situation in which Royal was losing all matches, into a victory in the final encounter. Now I am also trying to do what the Royal cricket Captain had done. Last July, I was asked to take over the country. At that time, there was a shortage of fuel, a shortage of fertiliser, and a shortage of food and there was a shortage of everything. We had no money. We couldn’t make our payments. The government had no money. It was a difficult task. It was like the Royal team which had lost most of the matches and many thought that we won’t be able to come out of it. So far, in the last seven months, we have been able to; my team has been able to stabilise the situation. There is fuel now. There is electricity. There is fertilizer and by April, there will be enough rice and other foodstuff. We will no longer be declared a bankrupt Nation, but a Nation that can restructure its debts. That will happen in the next few days. So like the Captain of the Royal Team, I also have to perform the same function. How do we turn this economy around? The results of the IMF Board of Directors only give us a breathing space where they will say that we are no longer bankrupt and we can restructure the debt."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

We have drawn attention to the issue of whether any release of energy during the tremors occurred in Sri Lanka, he said. He added that there should be no undue fear of any damage occurring. Meanwhile, Geography Professor Atula Senaratne of the Peradeniya University said the Richter scale reading of the tremors that have occurred in the last 30 – 40 years was less than 4. Therefore, huge earthquakes in the country were out of the question. However,tremors reading 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5on the Richter scale may occur in the future too, he added. BY Aloka Kasturiarachchi"

Another reason for the increase in the sale of illegal spirits, he said, is the inability to buy regular spirits due to irregularities at spirit stores."

One among them had died from Listeria infection, a foodborne bacterial illness that can be very serious. President of the Public Health Inspectors Union of Sri Lanka (PHIUSL), Upul Rohana yesterday (16) said that at least four persons had died and ten persons were being treated for symptoms of food poisoning. “However, the Regional Epidemiologist and Regional Director Health Services were investigating as to whether the victims were cases of food poisoning or a bacterial infection. He appealed to the Sri Pada Pilgrims, those going on pilgrimages to other places of devotion and the trip goers to especially be cautious of the food and water they consume. “Be very conscious of food and drinking water safety as it would be best to take food which has been prepared at home,” he advised. It would also be preferable to take water, that has been boiled and cooled at home, in a container. Be careful to purchase food and water to drink from places that are certified as healthy places.  Rohana advised the public to seek medical attention if they had symptoms of food poisoning such as diarrhoea, vomiting, body pain and fever symptoms. Health officials in the district were alerted when they received a culture positive Listeria case, of a woman who had been helping her daughter to run a shop at Sri Pada. She had suffered from vomiting, headache and altered consciousness. The woman had succumbed to the illness a few days later despite the medical attention she had received. The second case had been that of a 16-year-old girl, who had fallen ill after climbing to Sri Pada and had sought treatment for food poisoning symptoms.  The Regional Epidemiologist and relevant authorities had taken samples for investigation. Meanwhile, President of the Sri Lanka College of Microbiologists (SLCMB), Dr. Rohini Wadanambi, reiterated that the Regional health authorities were carrying out investigations. However, listeriosis which was allegedly diagnosed in the first victim was caused by Listeria monocytogenes, bacteria which lived in moist environments soil, pasture, decaying vegetation and animals. She said that the disease causing bacteria lived in cold temperatures and could even grow under refrigeration and other food preservation measures. Those at high risk were the immune suppressed groups, elderly persons, pregnant women and infants.  The disease could cause meningitis and blood stream infections. By Dilanthi Jayamanne "

At that stage, SDIGs Lalith Pathinayake and Nilantha Jayawardena were respectively in the order of seniority after SDIG Tennakoon. His ranking was changed due to a technical issue in entering the IGP commendation data, while appearing for the interview for the position of DIG from the position of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), he lost four points. The reason for this was the provision of data in the old format instead of Form 230B in the IGP’s Commendation Register.

Owing to the current economic crisis, it is observed that the number of suicides amongst apparel factory employees has increased and as a result, suicides in the Gampaha District have increased at an abnormal rate, he pointed out. “Many of these suicides happen due to flash decisions. At the same time, 18 per cent of suicides have happened by consuming hazardous pesticides,” he said. Financial issues, relationship issues, consuming alcohol, family issues, assaults and various illnesses are among the main reasons for suicides.  Suicides are reported mainly from elderly males, LGBTQI+ community, young women and prisoners, he added. Speaking further, he said 15.6 per cent from every 100,000 of population died by suicide in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Also, the ratio of attempts at suicides is 1:15. The NIMH Director said, he WHO has rated Sri Lanka as the 3rd in the list of countries that have the highest suicide rates. “But this is not true. Sri Lanka is in the 30th place. We have informed the WHO to correct this,” he said. (If you needs mental health assistance dial 1926: the hotline of National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)) BY Amith Maduranga Gamage"

The two were later brought to India’s Mumbai International Airport and was supposed to be repatriated to Sri Lanka on Tuesday (14). The CID team had to defer the repatriation to yesterday (15) due to a flight delay. On 8 March, the defence officials in Madagascar officially informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the arrest of eight suspects including ‘Harak Kata’ and ‘Kudu Salindu.’ According to foreign media, a Malagasy woman who claims to be his spouse and her father were also among the suspects arrested in Madagascar on 1 March. L’Express, a leading media network in Madagascar, mentioned that the suspects had been taken into custody at the Ivato International Airport in Antananarivo, Madagascar, while trying to fly out of the country. The arrests had been made in a joint operation conducted by the National Central Bureau (NCB) of the INTERPOL, Madagascar’s law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. According to L’Express, five Sri Lankan suspects had landed in Nosy Be on a private jet on 12 February. The group later travelled to Antananarivo on a domestic flight the following day. After staying at two hotels in Ivato and Ambohimangakely, the suspects reached the airport in two luxury cars. The gendarmes (paramilitary police officers in France or French-speaking countries) had recognised and arrested them with the help of the red notices previously issued by the INTERPOL. During his stay in Madagascar, ‘Harak Kata’ had posed as a wealthy businessman while ‘Kudu Salindu’ and the others had pretended to be his bodyguards. The two luxury cars and the mobile phones of the suspects were also seized by the Madagascar law-enforcement authorities. Further, a sum of Malagasy Ariary (MGA) 32 million found on the woman who claimed to be the wife of ‘Harak Kata’ was also confiscated. Earlier, the Defence Ministry of Sri Lanka said necessary measures were taken through the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles to extradite the arrestees from Madagascar, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission there. After being officially informed of the arrest of the suspects, a group of local law-enforcement authorities comprising an Assistant Superintendent of Police and an Inspector of Police attached to the CID departed for Madagascar, along with two Special Task Force personnel. ‘Harak Kata’ who operates his drug syndicates in Dubai, Malaysia, Singapore, Seychelles, the Maldives and Madagascar was previously arrested at the Dubai International Airport last August.  However, he had changed his name to Herath Dissanayakage Roshan Isanka in the passport which was found on him at the time of his arrest in Dubai.

Speaking at an event held on 14 March, British High Commissioner Sarah Hulton said, “The UK’s DCTS provides Sri Lankan and UK businesses with a fresh opportunity to diversify and deepen supply chains and reduce the cost of exporting to the UK. We hope businesses will take advantage of the great opportunities we have highlighted through our events this week.” UK officials showcased high potential value chains and products that can benefit from the new scheme. This was based on research into UK retailers’ and consumers’ buying considerations, as well as insights from Sri Lankan producers, trade programmes and policymakers. The UK said, while Sri Lanka exports numerous high-value products to the UK including textiles, tea and rubber, there has been a steady decline in trade volumes betweenSri Lanka and the UK since 2018. Under UK trade preferences, Sri Lankan exports will benefit from generous tariff cuts and new products will be brought into scope, facilitating access to the UK market for Sri Lankan businesses across a wide range of industries. UK Minister of State at the Department for Business and Trade, Nigel Huddleston said:  “The Developing Country Trading Scheme will support businesses by giving them the tools to export duty-free to the UK, opening up markets and boosting consumer choice. “We want to go bigger and further with our global trade links and the DCTS enables the UK to achieve this with developing countries.” The new scheme has been designed to grow free and fair trade with 65 countries, including Sri Lanka, thereby creating jobs and boosting their economies. The DCTS offers one of the most generous sets of trading preferences in the world and demonstrates the UK’s commitment to building long-term, mutually beneficial relations with countries like Sri Lanka. During the visit to Colombo, DCTS officials also met the Minister of Trade, Commerce, and Food Security, Nalin Fernando. They additionally delivered further information sessions and engagements in partnership with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Department of Commerce, EDB, and BOI, Joint Apparel Association Federation, European Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka, AmCham Sri Lanka, and Rotary International. The sessions focused on sharing insights including present trends, UK market purchasing criteria, barriers to trade and what can be done to unlock Sri Lanka’s trade and investment potential. Attendees also learnt about other key trade-related information including quality certification and Customs requirements. The main event was attended by State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, and senior officials from the Department of Commerce, Export Development Board of Sri Lanka (EDB), and the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI). The event was delivered in partnership with the Council for Business with Britain – the UK-Sri Lanka bilateral trade association. (SRM)"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

The drivers have been warned if they are involved in fights or any other misconduct, action will be taken against them. Steps will be taken to revoke licences of such private bus drivers as well,” Gunawardana said. “The relevant authorities are taking appropriate action on this matter. However, it will take some time to set up a mechanism to regulate bus drivers,” he added. He said there is unwanted competition between them and private bus drivers are warned that if they are found guilty of being involved in quarrels their licences will be cancelled and this was also brought up in Parliament.   “If the SLTB bus drivers are found guilty, action will be taken against them as well.

The MPs present at the committee meeting, questioned Sri Lanka Law College Principal Dr. Athula Pathinayake about the purpose and reason behind making English mandatory for examinations. The MPs were of the view that many excellent professionals in the legal field sat for college examinations in a preferred language. Therefore, the committee was of the view that those who wish to become lawyers by sitting for exams in their mother tongue have never been a hindrance to excellence. Moreover, the committee members were of the view that Primary Courts, mainly use Sinhala and Tamil as the main languages during the proceedings. It is only the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court that use English. Furthermore, they pointed out that in the Northern Province and where the majority of population are Tamil and Muslim, Court hearings are conducted in Tamil while the Court proceedings are conducted in Sinhala in the areas where the majority is Sinhalese. Furthermore, they pointed out that it is a ground reality that people in many rural areas do not have facilities for education in the English medium.

No one has the authority to interfere with the decision of the Supreme Court. “It is clear that the judgment given on 3 March 2023, by the Supreme Court, is binding on the President, the Government and Parliament in equal measure, so, they need to follow that decision faithfully, the Archbishop claimed. “It was reported that two MPs have spoken concerning the judgment given by the Supreme Court. The MPs have called this decision, a violation of their parliamentary privileges,” Cardinal Ranjith charged, noting that the matter was to be viewed with great concern. This request by the MPs was not in keeping with the dignity and freedom of Supreme Court and any interference with Courts on the basis of Parliamentary Privileges is unacceptable, he added.

According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

It was mentioned in the Petition that clauses 1 to 134, and / or any one or more of them in the Bill are inconsistent with certain provisions of the Constitution. It was stated that cumulative effect of Clauses 5, 6 and 7 prevent the Executive and Legislature in the formulation of economic policy, including the monetary policy of the State. The power to formulate national policy, including economic policy, is vested in the Government. This power to formulate policy is a component of the executive power of the people and the alienation of that power infringes the sovereignty of the people. The Petitioner claimed that the Bill goes beyond protecting the professional independence of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and its officials and encroaches into directly exercising executive power in the formulation and implementation of policy to the exclusion of the Executive. Further, the Petitioner said clause 6(3) prevents the executive from taking decisions on economic policy other than by legislative action and that the power of the President cannot remove the Governor and members of governing body and the Monetary Policy Board even if the Governor or the members refuse to implement Government policy. He observed that compelling the Minister of Finance to sign a monetary policy framework agreement, fixing an inflation target allowing to only revise the same every three years and in ‘exceptional circumstances’ is arbitrary and violates the sovereignty of the people. It was also stated in the petition that removing the liability of members of the Monetary Board, with regard to pending litigation, including proceedings under Article 126, is an encroachment of the judicial power of the people entrenched in the Supreme Court. He added that giving the power to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to authorise transactions among residents of Sri Lanka, in currency other than Sri Lankan Rupees, is an attempt to use foreign currency in domestic transactions and may result in the Sri Lanka rupee going into disuse in the domestic market and to introduce the Indian rupee as suggested by interested parties for some time. Lastly, he observed that the essential link between the Central Bank and the Executive is severed by the omission of the Secretary to the Treasury from the governing Board even though, currently, the Secretary to the Treasury is an Ex-Officio member of the Monetary Board. He thereby prayed the Court to declare that such clauses are inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore require to be passed by two-third majority in Parliament and with the approval of the people at a referendum.

The Petitioners noted that the extents of forest land, including the forest reserve, have been parceled out to influential businessmen and politicians, claiming that these lands belong to the Nindagama of Soragune Kuda Kataragama Devalaya. The Petitioners state that these purported Nindagam lands have been bequeathed by the Trustees of the Soragune Kuda Kataragama Devalaya to various farmers for cultivation, resulting in forest destruction. Furthermore, large areas of land comprising parts of the Bogahapelessa forest reserve have also been cleared and handed out to influential businessmen and politicians, on the basis that these are Nindagama lands and belong to the Soragune Kuda Kataragama Devalaya, due to the lack of proper demarcation of the purported Nindagama land belonging to the adjoining Soragune Devalaya and that of the Bogahapelessa Reserve. The Petitioners observe that the ownership of the purported Nindagam, claimed by the Soragune Kuda Kataragama Devalaya, should be investigated and the boundaries of the Forest Reserves, Proposed Reserves and Other State Forests should be effectively demarcated to prevent the encroachment of the forest reserve, noting that nevertheless, the respondents had failed in their duties to prevent the encroachment of these invaluable forest lands, to monitor and take regulatory actions against the perpetrators and to demarcate the boundaries to effectively conserve the reserves and forest lands.

According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Nowadays, we hear a lot of sensitive news regarding children. We will create a system to take care of children if their parents are unable to raise them,” she said. She also said the concept of ‘single mother’ needs to be recognised by the society as a step to protect the children in the country.  Addressing a media briefing, at Department of Government Information yesterday (13), jointly with the Chairman of National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), Kumarasinghe said a single mother should be able to raise a child and live alone in society without any difficulties.  “A woman should be able to raise her kid alone without any difficulties in the society. Unfortunately, the single mother concept is not recognised in Sri Lanka. In fact, single mothers are often insulted by the society. This situation must be changed and we, as the ministry, are trying our best for that.” Speaking further, Kumarasinghe said the State Ministry is taking steps to establish safe houses for such mothers and she expects to seek assistance from NGOs for that.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/03/13/hrcsl-backtracks-on-summons-issued-to-public-security-minister/,HRCSL backtracks on summons issued to Public Security Minister,Author not found,0,2023-03-12T20:50:00+00:00,"The incident where the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has issued summons to the Public Security Minister to appear before it on Monday, 13 March, took a new turn yesterday (12), when the HRCSL Chairperson issued a fresh statement to ‘clarify’ the ‘erroneous’ statements in the media, with regard to the summons issued to the Minister. The latest statement, which outlines the powers and mandate of the HRCSL, stated that the Commission, through its Secretary, merely requested the Minister, under whose purview the Sri Lanka Police falls, to attend the HRCSL to provide certain clarifications. In a statement issued on 9 March, the HRCSL said Public Security Minister Tiran Alles has been summoned by the Commission over the crackdown by the Police on protests conducted by university students led by the Inter-University Students Federation (IUSF). It further said the subject Minister was summoned to appear before the HRCSL on 13 March to answer questions about the Police conduct on 7 and 8 March, when dispersing protests held near the University of Colombo and the University of Kelaniya, as part of an inquiry launched by the Commission on the day’s events and explain the procedures followed by the Sri Lanka Police. However, Human Rights Lawyer Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa pointed out that the mandate of the Commission is limited to calling for a report from State officials and carrying out an investigation based on such report, when a complaint is made or at an instance where fundamental rights are violated. He also noted that the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka does not enjoy judicial powers. On the other hand, four out of the five HRCSL members insisted that they did not take a decision to summon Minister Alles to appear before the Commission to record a statement on the conduct of the Police during undergraduate protests last week, and said that they were completely unaware of such a decision. Commissioner Dr. Nimal Karunasiri said all five members should be aware of any statement issued by the HRCSL. “This is not about whether the decision to summon the Minister is correct or not. This is about the Commission not taking such a decision at all,” he added. Commission member Dr. Vijitha Nanayakkara said the news reports on summoning Public Security Minister Alles on Monday (13) is in fact wrong and steps will be taken to call an explanation from the media spokesman, on what grounds he issued a media statement to that effect, despite four members of the HRCSL being unaware of it. While emphasising that the Commission has not met after 28 February, he also noted that other Commission members got to know about the decision to summon the Minister only through media reports. The Full Statement issued by the HRCSL Chairperson yesterday reads: “The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) notes that every citizen is entitled to the freedom of Assembly and expression and that this right has been exercised by different groups in the country, including trade unions, professional bodies, students and individuals. It has been alleged in several complaints that in several instances where such rights were exercised, law enforcement officers have resorted to the use of tear gas, water cannon and carrying wooden rods as a crowd control mechanism to disperse protesters. The Commission, as the key oversight body to promote and protect human rights in Sri Lanka, views this situation as one that warrants scrutiny, to ensure that the exercise of the right to protest and the restrictions imposed thereon are fully compatible with the relevant provisions of the Constitution and international human rights obligations of Sri Lanka. The Commission, per the mandate conferred on it under the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 (HRCSL Act), has initiated its inquiries and investigation process. The inquiries will ascertain whether the crowd control procedures adopted by law enforcement officers are in line with the constitutional provisions, international human rights obligations of Sri Lanka and basic principles of respecting human dignity. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka is inter alia required to “inquire into and investigate complaints regarding infringements or imminent infringements of fundamental Rights… (Section 10) The Commission may, on its own motion or on a complaint made to it by an aggrieved person, or group of persons, or a person acting on behalf of an aggrieved person or a group of persons, investigate an allegation of the infringement or imminent infringement of a fundamental right of such person or group of persons caused by the executive or administrative action. (Section 14) Several complaints have been received by the Commission regarding alleged infringements of fundamental rights by the Police, in the course of attempts to prevent protests from being carried out around the Universities of Colombo and Kelaniya on 7 March and 8 March 2023. Press Notice No: HRC/P/E/i/12/03/23 2 Accordingly, the HRCSL is required by law to inquire into such alleged infringements of fundamental rights. Ordinarily, in the first instance, the investigations are handled by the Inquiries & Investigation Division of the HRCSL, which accordingly commenced an investigation. The HRCSL is vested with the power to inter alia, (a) Investigate any infringement or an imminent infringement of fundamental rights in accordance with the succeeding provisions of the Act. (b) do all such other things as are necessary or conducive to the discharge of its functions. (vide Section 11) In order to conduct such an inquiry, the HRCSL also inter alia, (c) to summon any person residing in Sri Lanka, to attend any meeting of the Commission to give evidence or produce any document or other thing in his possession, and to examine him as a witness or require him to produce any document or other thing in his possession. (vide Section 18) However, while the HRCSL possesses full power and authority to summon any person residing in Sri Lanka to give evidence and produce documents, with regard to the aforesaid incident, at this stage, the HRCSL, through its Secretary, merely requested the Minister, under whose purview the Sri Lanka Police falls, to attend the HRCSL to provide certain clarifications. The HRCSL is optimistic that the discussion with the Minister would help to adopt a mechanism to prevent the violations of fundamental human rights in the future and recommend human rights-compliant guidelines for the crowd control during the protest. The HRCSL also observes that in terms of Article 4(d) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, the fundamental rights, which are by the Constitution declared and recognised shall be respected secured, and advanced by all organs of the government. Thus the HRCSL wishes to clarify that certain reports circulating to the effect that summons had been issued on the said Minister are inaccurate and that no such summons has been issued at this stage. This statement is made to clarify the erroneous statements carried out in the media. As such, the HRCSL is confident that all members of the Executive would act in the spirit of cooperation with the HRCSL in ascertaining factual matters relevant to the events of the7and 8March 2023."

Prior to the CFAMM, on 13 March the Foreign Minister will attend the Commonwealth Day celebrations, which also marks the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Commonwealth Charter that outlines the values and aspirations uniting the Commonwealth member countries. The member states will also support the ‘Commonwealth Flag for Peace’ initiative in symbolising these values and the celebrations will end with a reception hosted by King Charles III for the visiting Foreign Ministers. This year’s CFAMM will engage the Foreign Ministers in discussing joint responses to shared challenges such as the need to build resilience for peaceful and sustainable societies, climate financing for environmental sustainability and leveraging intra-Commonwealth trade and digital connectivity for economic recovery, food, and energy security. Around the Commonwealth, cities will host inter-faith, multi-cultural observances to mark the Commonwealth Day. One of the largest gatherings will be the traditional service at Westminster Abbey in London, attended by King Charles. “It is a privilege for my country to host so many leaders and representatives,” British Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly said. A statement from the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on Commonwealth Day highlighted that occasions like these afford them the unique opportunity to meet and speak in the extended company of old and valued friends. “But they are much more than that. Commonwealth Day is a chance to address our most pressing issues. To consider new cures for common concerns. For us to fashion a fresh vision for an uncertain future. 2023 is a particularly special year for our Commonwealth. It is the 10th anniversary of the Commonwealth Charter. It sets out the values and aspirations of our close partnership. Values like peace, security, rule of law, good governance and sustainability. These principles must always be our priorities. They are more relevant now than ever before. It is also the Commonwealth Year of Youth. Home to 1.4 billion young people, we should never forget that the destiny of the Commonwealth is dependent on the next generation. Let us think about what we want to bequeath them,” it said. The British Foreign Secretary said he is proud of the Commonwealth membership, and committed to doing what he can to ensure that this formidable fellowship of friendly nations delivers real benefits to the 2.5 billion people living in its 56 members states. “The foundation of our friendship might be based on a complex history, but it is also based on a shared understanding – that we can help one another; that we can meaningfully improve the lives of people around the world, that sovereignty, democracy and freedom should and must be defended no matter the price. We should never forget the incomparable make-up of this progressive organisation. It includes some of the world’s largest and most prosperous economies as well as some of the smallest and most aspirational. Our diversity of scale poses an excellent opportunity to address lingering economic imbalances; to protect our planet and enhance our chances for a sustainable future,” it said. "

Edirisinghe added that Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health at the time, hired them as dengue control assistants in three stages on 6 March 2017. “We were tasked with assisting Medical Officers of Health in dengue control at the time, and it is six years since we were hired. We are paid as little as Rs 733 per day, with a monthly salary of Rs 22,000. According to the country’s present economic situation, that amount is insufficient. Thus, 1,125 of our members working islandwide have faced untold hardship. The daily allowance doesn’t even cover the bus fare, and an additional Rs 1,000 is required for bus fare and food,” he said.

The event was organised for the third consecutive year and it featured eight prominent women from diverse industries and sectors. They were given the opportunity to speak for eight minutes on “what they would do differently if they were given the opportunity to lead the country.” The eight women featured at the panel event were Sabrina Esufally, Managing Director, Hemas Consumer Brands, Suhani Kariyawasam Pathirana, Vice President of the Sri Lanka Central Federation of the Deaf, Oshadhi Ranasinghe, Vice Captain of the Sri Lanka Women’s Cricket team, Bhoomi Harendran from the National Transgender Network Trust, Dr. Shemoon Marleen, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Chani Imbulgoda, Deputy Registrar of the University of Visual and Performing Arts, Dinusha Jayamanne, General Manager Human Resources at Brandix and Niranjani Shanmugaraja, Actress and media personality. Sabrina Esufally, opening the forum, stressed the need for better budgetary allocations for education, increasing female labour participation, government expenditure reduction and policy reforms for State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Suhani Kariyawasam Pathirana, who shared her views representing the differently-abled population, highlighted the need for equal access to education for her community, which would, in return, give them ample opportunities to contribute to the economic growth of the country. Oshadhi Ranasinghe, one of the prominent sports personalities in Sri Lanka, stressed the importance of enhancing the sports sector through enhanced female participation. In her speech, she focused on the importance of implementing social security measures for sportswomen as it would encourage more women to pursue their prospects in the sports arena. The highlight of Bhoomi Harendran’s speech was the need to create an inclusive society where differences and diversity are embraced. She said one’s sexual orientation should not be a measure to determine how that person is treated in society. She spoke of standing for humanity which will usher in a better and safer future for all. Dr. Marleen spoke for fair reproductive health and creating a culture of family planning in Sri Lanka while Imbulgoda expressed her views on addressing critical issues such as process and system development in the country, how technocrats, experts and professionals should be brought in to manage Sri Lanka. Jayamanne, a veteran in Human Resource Management, talked about digital education for all and ensuring financial stability for women – a key component of Sri Lanka’s apparel sector. Niranjani Shanmugaraja, an award-winning actress, talked about measures to create an empowered nation. “Reconciliation cannot be achieved by mere words or pledges. It can only be achieved through action. Action speaks louder than words. I would like to ask this audience if they truly want to elect a person like me – a Tamil woman hailing from a normal family – as the President of Sri Lanka,” she queried. Wolfgang Heinze, the Country Head of Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom in Sri Lanka, said the main objective of the event was to demonstrate the manner in which women will lead if given access to decision-making platforms and adequate opportunities in governance. Delivering the closing remarks, NextGenSL core team member Lihini Fernando said the event would convince the key decision-makers as to why there should be measures to meaningfully address the underrepresentation of women in politics. A number of young political figures from the main political parties are presently working with NextGenSL in various capacities and its main objective is to drive positive youth engagement in politics and work towards addressing challenges that prevent young people — both men and women — from actively engaging in politics. It also seeks to facilitate a healthy political culture and an inclusive platform where diverse political views could be discussed in an amicable manner."

Addressing the media at the Colombo Archbishop’s House, Spokesman for the Colombo Archdiocese, Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando, quoting Colombo Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, said with rumours of the incumbent IGP C.D. Wickramarathne’s retirement due in April, suspicions have been raised that three Police Officers, whose names are mentioned, in the PCoI report, for disciplinary inquiries to be conducted against, have been nominated for the post of IGP. “It has been four years to 21 April 2023 since Easter Sunday bombings. But until now, we believe that the truth behind the brutal murders have not been fully revealed,” he lamented. Fr. Fernando said, several recommendations had been made, in the final report of the PCoI, appointed to probe the incident. There were a total three reports that had probed the bombings of churches and hotels killing 271 and injuring hundreds, throwing the lives of the victims into misery. “With the information that had been received during the weeks prior to the bombings there had been multiple occasions in which this tragedy could have been averted. Several high ranking State Officials and several Police Officers were mentioned in the PCoI report for alleged dereliction of duty and disciplinary action against them had been recommended ,” he said. Pledging that the Catholic Church would do everything possible to give justice to Easter Sunday Victims, Fr. Fernando said, “His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, in June 2022, filed a case in the Court of Appeal, on behalf of the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka, seeking an order for the IGP to implement the recommendations of the PCoI against those Police Officers. It was a shameful waste of public funds to have spent a colossal Rs 91 million on the operations of the PCoI, as the authorities are not doing anything despite the recommendations of that commission.” By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Referring to media reports that HRCSL has summoned Public Security Minister Tiran Alles to record a statement, on the conduct of the Police during undergraduate protests on 7 and 8 March Dr. Mahanamahewa pointed out that Clause 11 of the HRSCL Act, No. 21 of 1996 states: “For the purpose of discharging its functions the Commission may exercise any or all of the following powers:- investigate, any infringement or imminent infringement of fundamental rights, in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this Act  (b) appoint such number of sub-committees at Provincial level, as it considers necessary to exercise such powers of the Commission as may be delegated to them, by the Commission, under this Act The HRCSL is not an institution which can punish any individual and it only mandates to give recommendations when necessary to safeguard human rights.” Dr. Mahanamahewa pointed out that if the HRCSL felt the need to investigate the incidents of human rights violations on both occasions by the Police or Security Forces, it could have called for a report from the respective ministry secretaries and the IGP. “This is also connected to national security. The Commission cannot force anyone to divulge sensitive details pertaining to national security. If the Commission summons one Minister, they will also have to summon the President, who is the Defence Minister and also the members of National Security Council at this rate – which is not possible,” he pointed out. He also pointed out that the Language Commission has more powers than the HRCSL, where in the Language Commission Act it is clearly mentioned what course of legal actions it could take in the event the Commission feels their recommendations were not followed. “If we take the recent incident of the electricity tariff hike, where both CEB and PUCSL officials were summoned by the HRCSL, the mandate is quite evident. There, the CEB officials disregarded the recommendations by the HRCSL and when the Commission went to Superior Courts challenging CEB officials’ act, the Supreme Court didn’t even find grounds to proceed,” he pointed out. Human Rights Lawyer Dr. Pratibha Mahanamaheva said in an incident involving a human rights violation, the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission should first call and study a report through the officials of the relevant government agency and it is not in their mandate to summon the Minister-in-Charge of the subject."

Addressing the media at the Colombo Archbishop’s House, Spokesman for the Colombo Archdiocese, Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando, quoting Colombo Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, said with rumours of the incumbent IGP C.D. Wickramarathne’s retirement due in April, suspicions have been raised that three Police Officers, whose names are mentioned, in the PCoI report, for disciplinary inquiries to be conducted against, have been nominated for the post of IGP. “It has been four years to 21 April 2023 since Easter Sunday bombings. But until now, we believe that the truth behind the brutal murders have not been fully revealed,” he lamented. Fr. Fernando said, several recommendations had been made, in the final report of the PCoI, appointed to probe the incident. There were a total three reports that had probed the bombings of churches and hotels killing 271 and injuring hundreds, throwing the lives of the victims into misery. “With the information that had been received during the weeks prior to the bombings there had been multiple occasions in which this tragedy could have been averted. Several high ranking State Officials and several Police Officers were mentioned in the PCoI report for alleged dereliction of duty and disciplinary action against them had been recommended ,” he said. Pledging that the Catholic Church would do everything possible to give justice to Easter Sunday Victims, Fr. Fernando said, “His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, in June 2022, filed a case in the Court of Appeal, on behalf of the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka, seeking an order for the IGP to implement the recommendations of the PCoI against those Police Officers. It was a shameful waste of public funds to have spent a colossal Rs 91 million on the operations of the PCoI, as the authorities are not doing anything despite the recommendations of that commission.” By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Chief Guest was the illustrious Professor Emeritus Jennifer Perera, famed Microbiologist and former Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, who addressed the gathering on ‘The importance of Women’s Health in Economic Development’. Professor Emeritus Takshala Serasinghe, the keynote Speaker, spoke on ‘DigitAll: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality’. In her welcome address, giving an overview of its history, Dr. Krishnaratne said the SLFUW was set up as a non-political, non-governmental charitable body in 1941, even before the University was established. She paid tribute to the dedicated ladies who contributed to its development. Foremost among them was its Founder President Clara Motwani, a young American with a Master’s Degree in Education and her group of friends, which included Hilda Kularatne, Doreen Wikramasinghe, and Susan George Pulimood. Their foresight and commitment led to the expansion of educational opportunities for the ‘girl child’, a primary need of the time. SLFUW Meetings were held in their homes initially, but in 1996, Professor Lorna Devaraja and Manel Abeysekara were able to obtain a block of land in Kitulwatte Road, Colombo, from the UDA. Finally, overcoming many difficulties the SLFUW was able to move into its own premises in 2006. The programme included the felicitation of two Past Presidents who were present, Professor Nayani Melagoda and Seela Ebert, for their leadership and service.  Five scholarships were presented to University students from underprivileged areas. The President also thanked Indra Puvimanasingham, a former SLFUW President, for a donation of educational equipment from a well-wisher in America. It was handed over to Ananda Samarakoon Vidyalaya in Wewala, attended primarily by underprivileged children.   A noteworthy feature of the event was the participation of members of the Visually Impaired Women’s Federation, with its President Violet Yakandawala, who had obtained her University Degree at a time when even Braille facilities were not available. She revealed the startling fact that the first persons to discriminate against the visually impaired were the family members themselves. Visually impaired children were considered an embarrassment to the family, and kept in hiding, out of sight of society. The celebration was well-attended and well-organised, with dance items by the Sri Lanka Army Dance Troupe, and a song movingly rendered by a second-year law student at the University of Colombo. The General Secretary, Anjali Gamage offered her thanks to all those who helped the SLFUW  in many ways including the Sponsors of the event, and the Council Members who did all the behind-the-scenes-preparatory work for the celebrations. The Sri Lanka Federation of University Women is the foremost organisation of educated women in Sri Lanka engaged in community service work. During the past 82 years, it has made an immense contribution to the welfare of women and children in particular and to the community at large. “The people of Sri Lanka are facing extremely difficult times at present, and we wish that, under its aegis, the women of Sri Lanka will be able to help our motherland forge ahead in socio-economic and cultural development.”"

He added that the bidding process will last for one month and the announcement will be made in the public domain. The current biometric passport has been upgraded, but the need has arisen for an e-passport, which will be slightly more expensive than the current passport. Once a passport expires, individuals will have to apply for an e-passport. The chip in the e-passport is designed to provide enhanced security and protect against identity fraud by using biometric technology. A polycarbonate chip, which provides a secure and durable storage medium for the passport holder’s personal information, is commonly used in e-passports.

He said President Ranil Wickremesinghe proudly announced in Parliament that the IMF facility would be approved this month, and that the President also invited anyone to show him alternatives if his approach was incorrect. “We are prepared to demonstrate why his approach is incorrect and what the genuine alternative is. Once we are out of bankruptcy, his plan is to obtain loan after loan. USD 2.9 billion from the IMF, USD 1.5 billion from the World Bank, USD 1 billion from the Asian Development Bank, and an additional USD 2 billion from the issuance of government bonds. It means that the Government intends to borrow at least USD 7.4 billion over the next three years,” he explained. He told the media yesterday that it should not be forgotten that they will have to start repaying loans in 2025. He claims that in five years, Sri Lanka will be back in the debt trap, leading to an economic crisis worse than the current one. “If we ended in this crisis because of excessive borrowings, how can further borrowings be the solution? The cause and solution of a problem cannot be the same thing. President Gotabaya faced this crisis as a result of the current President’s excessive borrowings from 2015 to 2019. If he makes the same mistake again, the next President will be in big trouble,” he said. In addition, Gammanpila said in a typical year, earnings total USD 23 billion from exports, USD 7 billion from worker remittances, and USD 4 billion from tourism. “We have to spend USD 22 billion for imports.  It means our inward remittance is sufficient to meet the import bills.  Our problem is we need further USD 5 billion to pay back loans.  If we increase our borrowings, our repayment of loans will also be increased, and our dollar outflow will be further burdened,” he said.

Wickremesinghe warned if the ongoing programme implemented by the Government is disrupted, the country could be pushed to an even more perilous state than it experienced in February and March of 2022. The President also said an election can be held once normalcy is restored. However, he did not mention about holding the Local Government Election 2023 which has been postponed. The President only spoke about the Presidential and General Elections in his speech. The Government had to revert to the same tax policy implemented in 2019. After the emergency tax cuts implemented at the end of 2019, Government revenues fell by as much as 8 per cent of GDP. “To restore it, we had to go for new tax policies,” he said. “Similarly, interest rates had to be raised under the Central Bank’s monetary policies. Raising interest rates was a positive step we had to take to control the rising inflation. By September last year, average inflation had risen to around 70 per cent. Food inflation crossed the 90 per cent mark.” However, at present the rate of inflation has decreased to approximately 50 per cent, and food inflation has also dropped to 54 per cent. In addition, due to a shortage of foreign exchange, exchange regulations were tightened, and imports were limited. “Starting in 2021, the IMF has been issuing constant warnings about Sri Lanka’s economic crisis, specifically regarding the foreign exchange crisis. Since mid-2022, discussions between the IMF and Sri Lanka have been ongoing, with regular delegations visiting the country for extensive talks concerning the balance of payments, fiscal crisis, and foreign exchange crisis. Further, the IMF has emphasised the need to implement long-overdue structural reforms, stating that there is no room for delay.” “We had a staff-level agreement with the IMF by 1 September 2022, but the IMF stated that the agreement couldn’t be presented to the Executive Board until our country achieves debt sustainability. To achieve debt sustainability, the Government continued discussions with creditors and sought the help of international agencies such as Lazard and Clifford Chance. The discussions were lengthy and complex. Accordingly, discussions were held with both Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors, including India and China, who have provided loans to Sri Lanka, to secure financing assurances. India provided their assurance on 16 January while China extended their assurance on 18 January. The Paris Club agreed to provide financing assurances to Sri Lanka at their meeting held on 25 January. In addition, we had lengthy discussions with India and China as well. Subsequently, I discussed with the Managing Director of the IMF Kristalina Georgieva about an Extended Fund Facility Arrangement on 2 March. On Monday (6) evening, I discussed with the United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen as well. The Government had to fulfil the requirements set by the IMF, which included revisions to electricity tariffs and fossil fuel prices, ensuring the independence of the CBSL, and increasing interest rates to control inflation, reforming public enterprises, strengthening the social safety net, working to increase public revenue and controlling public expenditure. Expanding competition in the petroleum and electricity sectors had to be done in advance. Those tasks that Sri Lanka should have done proactively have been completed by now.” The President, who apologised to the public for all the sufferings they have to undergo, said this time, there is no room for failure in completing every task agreed on with the IMF, unlike the previous 16 occasions. “If the existing agreement with the IMF is breached, foreign economic activities will be largely hindered, and we would have to pay loans taken from foreign countries and private banks,” he pointed out. “We accept the people’s right to freedom of speech. But that should be done peacefully. Holding meetings and holding protests is not a problem. But I would like to say that if this programme is disrupted through this agitation, this government will act strongly on it,” the President said. “We can decide on holding an election, be it a Presidential Election or General Election when the country is stabilised. A decision about it will be taken by the country. What I’m asking is whether y’all are ready or not for this (journey of reviving the economy). You can accept or reject my invitation. It is totally up to you,” the President asserted. By Methmalie Dissanayake and Aloka Kasturiarachchi"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts.

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

WPC proposes to develop a more effective and efficient complaint and investigative mechanism to regulate gender-based violence on digital platforms to safeguard the well-being and dignity of women and girls.  WPC also says that it is necessary to increase awareness on digital gender-based violence and safer means of using digital platforms among the public. The statement was issued by Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Chairperson of the Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus to mark International Women’s Day, which falls today (8). “On 8 March 2023, we commemorate International Women’s Day which is observed with an overall objective of promoting the understanding of issues faced by women striving for greater gender equality and women’s empowerment, while celebrating the progress made so far towards achieving such goals. Whereas an international day dedicated towards women might appear inconsequential, the observance of this day is crucial in creating public awareness on women’s rights and issues faced by women, and above all it is a powerful advocacy tool to mobilise political will and resources to realise gender equality and women’s empowerment.” It was emphasised that in order to cater to the changing world and the problems that come hand in hand with it, the theme for this year’s International Women’s Day is ‘DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality.’ “With the advancement of technology and globalisation, the challenges that women face have changed. However, prejudices and stereotypical beliefs still stand in the way of women realising their full potential, even in the 21st century. In light of the pandemic and the resultant movement restrictions imposed, life on earth drastically changed with many activities, ranging from professional work, education and social activities, being transformed and transferred to the online digital world. Online education and working from home have now become the norm in many post-pandemic societies, including Sri Lanka. Therefore, the use of digital spaces and devices increased drastically, particularly among children, as parents permitted children to access the Internet and use smartphones in order to facilitate online education.” WPC emphasised that while the overall usage of online and digital spaces and devices have increased, a considerable part of the country is prevented from accessing the Internet altogether due to problems ranging from connectivity issues to the inability to purchase digital devices due to economic constraints.  “This is particularly detrimental to children whereas online education has become the new norm. It also appears that in instances where a family could afford just one device, the male child is given preference over the female child to use the device due to prejudicial beliefs. It is reported worldwide that the digital literacy is lower for women than for men due to the limitations faced by women in their access to devices, networks and data.” However, WPC noted that if it is also not used correctly, the Internet could very easily become a medium to propagate violence and harassment. “Complaints made to the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT) and National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) by distressed individuals and parents reached a record-high by a pandemic-hit society. The victims of most such instances were women and girls. Therefore, increasing awareness on digital gender-based violence and safer means of using digital platforms among the public is an imperative,” WPC said. In view of the above, the WPC also said it has strengthened its efforts to initiate discussions to mobilise resources for improved accessibility to the Internet and to improve regulations to prevent digital gender-based violence. While acknowledging there is still a long way to go, the WPC said it is committed to its undertaking to empower women, and create an enabling environment that promotes, protects and supports the digital rights, well-being and dignity of women and girls.    "

The Court of Appeal two-Judge-Bench comprising Justices Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and M.A.R. Marikkar made this order after considering a motion, filed on behalf of Rev. Father Cyril Gamini, seeking a fuller Appellate Court Bench to hear the Petition filed by Sirisena. While a motion requesting for the appointment of a fuller Bench should only be filed before a Bench comprising the President of the Court of Appeal, the motion was thereby filed before Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne (President) and the relevant decision will be issued on 14 March. A Private Plaint was filed by Rev. Father Gamini and a victim of the Easter Sunday attack, Jesudasan Nadesan, before the Fort Magistrate on 16 September 2022, alleging that Sirisena had failed to order the arrest of Zahran Hashim and his followers, to oversee their arrest, to prevent the murder of those who do not profess the Islamic faith, thus resulting in omissions in terms of the Penal Code. Oral submissions were made on behalf of the complainants and the Fort Magistrate made an order issuing summons on Sirisena requiring him to be present before the Fort Magistrate’s Court on 14 October 2022. Sirisena, through the Writ Application, observed that the Magistrate has failed to exercise his discretion properly in deciding to issue summons and has erred in law in acting upon hearsay. It was noted that the Magistrate has acted on inadmissible material and that the complainants have wilfully misrepresented facts and as such, the Fort Magistrate has misdirected himself on the material facts and that complainants have wilfully suppressed material facts, mainly that there was a State Minster of Defence overlooking the Department of the Police and the Armed Forces and Intelligence agencies during the relevant period.

Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera noted that if the disease spreads, it will primarily affect the production of milk.  Additional Secretary of the ministry Dr. L. W. N. Samaranayake said the condition was first reported in Sri Lanka in 2019, adding that there is however a low mortality rate amongst cattle infected with this virus and that they often heal with treatment.   He added that cattle once infected with the disease have no possibility of contracting the disease again. ’’This disease does not spread by wind like foot and mouth disease. The only way the virus spreads is through direct contact with other animals. Therefore, the sick animals should be kept away from the cowsheds and isolated, ‘’he said. Amaraweera instructed the Livestock Development Division to promptly investigate the situation and take necessary action in consultation with veterinarians. He noted that the Ministry of Agriculture has already taken a number of measures to prevent diseases in districts such as Nuwara Eliya, where animal husbandry is practiced on a large scale.  While stating that there is no need to be afraid of LSD, as the death of infected cows is at a minimum level, he added however that if the disease spreads, it will primarily affect the production of milk, due to which those involved in cattle management should be vigilant.

The Opposition questioned UNP MP Wajira Abeywardena’s being appointed as the Acting Chairperson of the committee. The Speaker announced that after Dissanayake’s resignation, the Parliament Committee of Selection will meet on 4 April to appoint a new Chairperson.  At this juncture, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella questioned why Abeywardena was appointed as the Acting Chairperson of COPF. Kiriella claimed that Abeywardena has been temporarily given the chairmanship of COPF and that it is against the Standing Orders. He emphasised that according to the Standing Orders, an Opposition member should be made the chairperson to maintain stability. Even if it’s temporary the chairperson should be from the Opposition, he stressed.

Addressing the media, on leasing ‘mafia’, President of the association Asanka Ruwan Pothupitiya said the Inspector General of Police (IGP) has issued an order prohibiting the forcible seizure of vehicles and that several individuals involved in forcibly seizing vehicles have been arrested and are in remand. “We understand that paying off debt is a responsibility. However, there is a mafia in action on vehicle leasing. This is a daylight robbery because some leasing companies are like leeches and they increase the instalments, as they wish, without giving any thought about the customer. We can’t pay money like that. It is unfair by the customers. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) should be held accountable for the daylight robberies carried out by these non-banking financial institutions. The customers have been cheated in many ways by these companies. First they charge instalments that the customer can’t bear. Then they came up with moratoriums and trapped customers. Now, those who leased the vehicles can’t pay instalments,” he elaborated. When the customer is in the debt trap created by the companies, the vehicles are forcibly seized using thugs and organised gangs, he said, adding  “We have now filed over 50 lawsuits against those who forcibly seized the vehicles. They have pleaded guilty for that in Court. We will file more lawsuits against individuals and institutions involved in forcible vehicle seizure. We will fight for the people,” he said.

Speaking to Ceylon Today, Wijeratne said when there is a protest, a they lose around Rs 10 million daily.  “Due to protests, we had to reduce the daily bus trips and a large volume of fuel was wasted on the road waiting in traffic. Including this fuel wastage, the total loss is closer to Rs 10 million per day in the Western province due to protests,” Wijeratne said. He added when compared to other provinces, the private bus sector in the Western Province suffered a heavy loss “State sector employees conduct protests while receiving salaries at the end of each month. But we have to make an income daily for our living. These protests do not affect the SLTB employees because they too receive a monthly salary,” he said. Therefore, Wijerathne said they had informed the Police earlier to ease the traffic congestion during protests or direct the protesters to areas where they would not be a hindrance to the traffic flow.

Addressing the media after a programme in Bulathkohupitiya, he said the country is gradually recovering from the economic crisis and paying taxes in the correct manner is essential for the economic growth. “One of the main reasons for the current crisis was that we cut taxes a few years ago. The PAYE tax was there and after 2019, we closed about 1.5 million files following the tax cuts. Now we are introducing an income tax scheme again and the amounts in taxes have been slightly increased. According to the new tax scheme, a person who earns Rs 150,000 pays Rs 3,000 as monthly tax.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The publication titled ‘Progress Report 2022-January to September’, further said that the number of such pending cases, which totalled 1,064,882 (1.1million), saw  that the highest number of such cases in Magistrate’s Courts (764,536), followed by District Courts (269,378),  High Courts criminal (30,030), Commercial High Courts (8,018),  Civil Appellate High Courts (7,030), Labour Tribunals (5,543),  Supreme Court (5,236), Appeal Court (3,506), Children’s Magistrate’s Courts (1,632) and Special High Courts (three).

The backlog of cases in Courts in Sri Lanka, as at 30.06.2022 is 1,094,912. The number of Judges for hearing those huge number of cases is 15 per one million of the population, but with the recent recruitment of judges, this ratio has increased 18 per one million of Sri Lanka’s population. However, this is very low in comparison to the international standard and may have caused to drag down Sri Lanka in international grading.” The report further said that to rectify these shortcomings, “It is expected to review the situation and prepare and implement a revised plan for implementation as soon as the economic situation is of the country is back to normal.

Co-Convener of the All Ceylon Medical Officers’ Association (ACMOA) Dr. Jayantha Bandara, who spoke about the current medicinal drug shortage in the country, alleged there is a matter regarding the commissions that politicians and officials received during importation as well. Dr. Bandara said that the Government’s corrupt method of procuring pharmaceuticals has been the main cause of the prevailing crisis. Dr. Bandara when contacted yesterday (06), alleged that at least 70 to 75 per cent of the funds spent on purchasing pharmaceuticals has been pilfered by pharmaceutical companies which acted as intermediaries for the State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC).  Leave aside the Government’s excuse of the prevailing economic crisis, it is unable to even utilise the available funds to purchase the necessary medicinal drugs, reagents and consumables to battle the prevailing shortage as a result, he alleged. “The SPC is affiliated to the Health Ministry and is tasked with importing medicinal pharmaceuticals – especially medicinal drugs, consumables and reagents to distribute them to State hospitals and to import raw materials to manufacture medicinal drugs locally.  The SPC has failed in its duty due to the machinations of the vested government interests,” he alleged.   Instead of utilising the SPC to its fullest capacity, the Health Ministry, through the SPC, imports a major portion of the medicinal drugs and reagent, paying a lion’s share to intermediaries, spending four or five times more than the actual cost. Citing an example, Dr. Bandara alleged that when there should only be a maximum difference of about 200% from procurement to retail, there was a 500 to 1000% difference incurred by the SPC when purchasing medicines through Pharmaceutical companies. Dr. Bandara lamented that there was also the issue with regard to the fast depleting human resource of the Health Ministry. Unconfirmed numbers have it that at least 2,000 medical practitioners had left the country for greener pastures. There is large number of medical practitioners currently engaged in study courses in a bid to leave the country, he noted. With the increasing cost of living, the government and Health Ministry have found a way to reduce the wages of all health sector employees. As a result, these doctors do not have much choice but to leave the country, he noted. Dr. Bandara accused the government of not having a proper plan to at least control the current situation. Dr. Bandara warned that his outfit would stage a token strike tomorrow (8) taking into consideration the above grievances. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"
