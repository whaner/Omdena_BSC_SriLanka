Hatton Ruwanpura Colony electricity consumers lamented that the electricity bill has increased excessively due to an increase in the number of electricity units and the bill has been calculated concurrently with the increased electricity tariff, which was supposed to go into effect on 15 February 2023. Those electricity customers said they cannot afford this electricity bill because agriculture is their way of life, and that they must pay a higher price than the electricity bill they received for their homes in the previous months through the new bill. When inquired about the issue of the electricity bill after 40 days from the Ruwanpura Colony metre reader, he did not say anything, and the metre reader told them that he would issue the electricity bill once every 30 days beginning with the March bill.

Addressing the media, at the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) yesterday (2), on ‘Changing Perspectives: Let’s talk about obesity’ for World Obesity Prevention Day, Dr. Gunawardana said that 22.5 per cent of men had been obese or overweight according to a survey carried out in 2015. It had risen to 30 per cent by 2021. The survey carried out by the NCD Unit every five years, to assess the NCD risk factors, had revealed that 34 per cent of women, were obese or over weight in 2015. It had increased to 48 per cent, by 2021, she said. Considering the figures, overweight and obesity among men and women had increased when compared to 2015. There was an increase of 6.3 per cent amongst men and a 15 per cent among women. The Consultant Community Physician explained that ‘overweight’ and ‘obesity’ were decided based on the Body Mass Index (BMI). According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the BMI of a healthy person should be between 18.5 and 24.9. Those below 18.5 were malnourished. A BMI between 25 and 29.9 was considered as ‘overweight’, she noted. “It affects weight gain. This increases the risk of developing non-communicable diseases later on,” Dr. Gunawardana added. A BMI of 30 or more was considered obese, Dr, Gunawardana said. “As Asians we should try to maintain a BMI of 23 making sure that it did not exceed it,” she added. “If the amount consumed is higher than the amount exhausted, that excess amount deposits in the body as oil,” Dr. Gunawardana said adding that the food pattern led to obesity and overweight increasing the risk of heart diseases, diabetes, lung diseases and certain types of cancers.

The travel advisory further said that Sri Lanka is experiencing a severe economic crisis, which has led to shortages of basic necessities, including medicines, cooking gas, fuel and food. The major shortage of fuel (diesel and petrol) is affecting transport, businesses, and emergency services. Hospitals and other medical services such as ambulances may be affected by shortages. There are daily power cuts due to electricity rationing.  Protests about the economic situation have led to violence against peaceful protesters in recent months, resulting in injuries and loss of life. Tear gas and water cannon have been used to disperse protesters. Protests, demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest could occur at short notice. Curfews and emergency regulations may also be imposed. You should be vigilant, avoid large gatherings and keep up to date with developments via this travel advice and local media. What remains still current on 2 March 2023 in the UK travel advisory is that terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sri Lanka. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Also, they continue to warn that Dengue fever occurs throughout the country. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Addressing the media, at the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) yesterday (2), on ‘Changing Perspectives: Let’s talk about obesity’ for World Obesity Prevention Day, Dr. Gunawardana said that 22.5 per cent of men had been obese or overweight according to a survey carried out in 2015. It had risen to 30 per cent by 2021. The survey carried out by the NCD Unit every five years, to assess the NCD risk factors, had revealed that 34 per cent of women, were obese or over weight in 2015. It had increased to 48 per cent, by 2021, she said. Considering the figures, overweight and obesity among men and women had increased when compared to 2015. There was an increase of 6.3 per cent amongst men and a 15 per cent among women. The Consultant Community Physician explained that ‘overweight’ and ‘obesity’ were decided based on the Body Mass Index (BMI). According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the BMI of a healthy person should be between 18.5 and 24.9. Those below 18.5 were malnourished. A BMI between 25 and 29.9 was considered as ‘overweight’, she noted. “It affects weight gain. This increases the risk of developing non-communicable diseases later on,” Dr. Gunawardana added. A BMI of 30 or more was considered obese, Dr, Gunawardana said. “As Asians we should try to maintain a BMI of 23 making sure that it did not exceed it,” she added. “If the amount consumed is higher than the amount exhausted, that excess amount deposits in the body as oil,” Dr. Gunawardana said adding that the food pattern led to obesity and overweight increasing the risk of heart diseases, diabetes, lung diseases and certain types of cancers.

Higher scores indicate greater equality vis-à-vis employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for women versus men and lower scores, the obverse. ‘Gender equality is essential to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity,’ the report quoting WB’s Chief Economist and Senior Vice President Carmen M. Reinhart, said. The WB defined ‘Women, Business and the Law ‘as an index that measures laws and regulations that affect women’s economic opportunity in 190 economies.  ‘In this regard, this project presents eight indicators structured around women’s interactions with the law as they progress through their lives and careers: Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, Parenthood, Entrepreneurship Assets, and Pension,’ it said. The indicators build evidence of the critical relationship between ‘legal gender equality’ and ‘women’s employment and entrepreneurship,’ the report added. Meanwhile, 12 countries had the perfect score of 100 out of 100 in this latest index, meaning that both men and women have equal opportunities as employees and businesspersons. They were, in alphabetical order, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Ratnapriya accused the JVP of being behind the spate of strikes that had been organised in several sectors. “One of the main slogans was the demand for elections. But a majority of the 22 million people in this country do not believe that an election should be held at this juncture. Only 500 to 2,000 persons attended a protest organised by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the Frontline Socialist Party (FSP). But now, the JVP has created an artificial situation and has been demanding an election,” he alleged. “That is why trade unions which claimed that they did not have political affiliations have been calling for an election and promoting the JVP slogan. Thereby, they too were associated with the political party to win their slogans. The demand for taxes to be reduced isn’t feasible,” he added. He said the President held discussions with the trade unions on 25 February. “The President queried if they wanted the IMF bailout or not and said he (the President) would arrange for them to meet the IMF representatives. The President also pledged to discuss the alternate proposals that had been submitted by the trade unions which are striking this week,” he further said. The DGTU lamented that the striking trade unions had left the discussion table on a positive note, but were now going back on their word. “But strikes will only show political instability in the country. It will only show that there is turmoil in the island. The message that is going out is that the IMF should not give assistance to a country which is politically unstable and in turmoil,” he said. Meanwhile, the trade union action was only partially successful, as only 44,540 public servants out of 148,451 in six provinces participated in it, according to a Government survey. The survey had been conducted in North Western, North Central, Southern, Central, Eastern and Uva provinces. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

These parties have dragged the country into a state of bankruptcy. So, how can one expect an overnight recovery,” he queried, noting it had been the GMOA which had pushed former President Rajapaksa to lock down the country during the first Covid-19 wave when several parties including the GMOF had said otherwise. The fertiliser issue was also orchestrated by the then GMOA Chief, he alleged.  “The GMOA under its former President was known to interfere in political decisions including its move to prevent the Government from entering into several agreements,” he alleged. “Therefore, if the doctors are unable to accept the Inland Revenue Tax, they can rename it as ‘Padeniya Tax.’ It has not only affected them, but several other professional categories in the country,” he lashed out. He urged all parties to accept President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s plea to bear patience till 2024 for an anticipated economic growth rather than strike. “Agitate if you want, but striking is not the solution,” he said.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The SLAF has come a long way since its first flight in a humble Chipmunk and de Havilland DC 1, passing through Mig 27s, Kfir C7s, and F-7s today. Many other aircraft have seen the largely ceremonial Air Force of the ‘70s emerge as a successful and battle-hardened Air Force of the 21st century, a spokesman said. The Royal Ceylon Air Force was formed on 2 March 1951, heralding the dawn of Sri Lanka’s military air power. On 2 March 1972, the Royal Ceylon Air Force was re-designated as the Sri Lanka Air Force with Ceylon becoming a Republic. Following the slogan Surakimu Lakambara, the SLAF has accomplished its duty to the country for the past 72 years, the spokesman added. The SLAF has consistently secured the airfields on the island and actively assisted the people in their time of need. Its role during the COVID-19 crisis and numerous other natural disasters has taken it close to the hearts of the people of Sri Lanka, who remember it for bringing them much needed relief in times of trouble by developing infrastructure in the health sector and assisting with the public vaccination drive, he further said and added, moving beyond Sri Lanka, the country is the proud owner of an extremely large Exclusive Economic Zone. Therefore, the SLAF successfully deployed the air asset to protect this vast area from illegal intrusion and fishing activities, extinguishing the fire in maritime vessels, and conducting Search and Rescue Operations, Maritime Pollution Monitoring and Control within the Sri Lanka Search and Rescue Region."

Higher scores indicate greater equality vis-à-vis employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for women versus men and lower scores, the obverse. ‘Gender equality is essential to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity,’ the report quoting WB’s Chief Economist and Senior Vice President Carmen M. Reinhart, said. The WB defined ‘Women, Business and the Law ‘as an index that measures laws and regulations that affect women’s economic opportunity in 190 economies.  ‘In this regard, this project presents eight indicators structured around women’s interactions with the law as they progress through their lives and careers: Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, Parenthood, Entrepreneurship Assets, and Pension,’ it said. The indicators build evidence of the critical relationship between ‘legal gender equality’ and ‘women’s employment and entrepreneurship,’ the report added. Meanwhile, 12 countries had the perfect score of 100 out of 100 in this latest index, meaning that both men and women have equal opportunities as employees and businesspersons. They were, in alphabetical order, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. In related developments in the SAARC region, three countries had higher ratings/points than Sri Lanka. They were Nepal (80.6 points), India (74.4) and Maldives (73.8). Nepal was 93rd and 94th equal out of 190 countries together with Kenya, India (124th) and Maldives (126th).

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/03/01/rti-prevails-over-declaration-of-assets-and-liabilities-law/,RTI prevails over Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law,Author not found,0,2023-02-28T21:00:00+00:00," In a landmark judgment, the Court of Appeal yesterday (28), held that the provisions of the Right to Information (RTI) Act shall prevail over the provisions of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law. This was when the appeal filed by the Designated Officer, Chief of Staff and Deputy Secretary-General of Parliament, K.A. Rohanadeera and the Secretary-General of Parliament Dhammika Dassanayake against Journalist Chamara Sampath and the Right to Information Commission was taken up before Court of Appeal Judges Sampath B. Abayakoon and P. Kumararatnam. Sampath had requested from the Information Officer of Parliament the list of names of MPs who have handed over their respective declarations of assets and liabilities in 2018 and the list of names of MPs who have handed over their declarations from 2010 up to the date of his request. The Information Officer, however, refused the request on the basis that he has to make an application in terms of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act, No. 1 of 1975 to the Speaker of Parliament, which is a separate Act that governs the declarations of the Members of Parliament. The Designated Officer too had held the same view. Sampath being aggrieved by the decision of the Designated Officer, appealed to the Commission in terms of Section 32 of the RTI Act, challenging the decision. After hearing the parties, the Commission, by the order appealed against, had reversed the decision of the Designated Officer and had ordered that the information requested by Sampath shall be released to him. The Commission had determined that the public authority in terms of the RTI Act being the Parliament of Sri Lanka and only one Information Officer and a Designated Officer have been appointed in relation to the said public authority, it is the duty of the Secretary-General of Parliament to provide the information requested by the respondent. They also stated that although the Speaker of Parliament is a separate institution within the Parliament of Sri Lanka, as the Chief Executive Officer of the Parliament, it is the duty of the Secretary-General to provide the information requested, which would not amount to any breach of the privileges of the Members of Parliament. The Commission had also noted that secrecy and the confidentiality of the declaration of assets and liabilities by the Members of Parliament would not be violated in terms of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law as what the respondent requested is not the details of the declarations tendered, but only a list of the Members of Parliament who filed their declarations of assets and liabilities in accordance with the law. Rohanadeera and Dassanayake then filed the instant appeal in the Court of Appeal on 15 grounds including that the said Order is wrong and contrary to law, the Commission erred in law by concluding that the Parliament of Sri Lanka is the relevant Public Authority in the case of the information requested by the respondent. They also stated the Commission erred in law and fact by failing to acknowledge that even the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition have separate Information Officers and Designated Officers, by failing to acknowledge that it is the Speaker of Parliament who has ‘possession, custody, or control’ of the information requested by the respondent and that the Commission erred in law when it held that the Parliament has institutional possession, custody and control of the information requested. Further, they noted the Commission erred in law by concluding that there is no impediment for the Secretary-General of Parliament to release the requested information, the Commission failed to appreciate that the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law is a special law which regulates all aspects relating to Declarations of Assets and Liabilities in Sri Lanka and that the Commission failed to acknowledge that the Declarations of Assets and Liabilities will prevail over the provisions of the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016, which is a general law. It had been their stand that the information requested by the respondent is in the possession, custody or control of the Speaker of Parliament and the Secretary-General of Parliament is in no position to interfere with the functions of the Speaker. It has also been urged that disclosure of any information on the assets and liabilities of the parliamentarians under the Right to Information Act would constitute a breach of the powers and privileges of the Parliament. Justice Sampath B. Abayakoon, delivering the judgement, said: “Members of Parliament are persons who are elected by the people and maintained by the people. They are expected to abide by the laws of the country at all times and provide examples for others to follow. Under the provisions of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law, any person who comes under the provisions of the Law, fails to provide the relevant declaration of assets and liabilities as required, would be committing an offence punishable with a fine or imprisonment of either description or both such fine and imprisonment. It is therefore important for the public to know whether the relevant authorities have acted as required by law or not. The only way to obtain that information would be by seeking the list of the name of the Members of Parliament who have provided their declarations under the RTI Act. I am of the view that even if the declaration of assets and liabilities by the Members of Parliament who are required to provide that information should be with the Speaker of Parliament, there cannot be any impediment to the Secretary-General of Parliament as the Chief Executive Officer of the institution to inquire into and provide a list of the names as requested by the respondent in terms of RTI Act, which in any way would not amount to encroaching on the powers of the Speaker of Parliament in my view. I find no basis for the submission that the Secretary-General is not expected to go on a voyage of discovery to provide the information required either, as the respondent has requested information available well within the Parliament of Sri Lanka. I am of the view that providing the list of names of the Members of Parliament who have tendered their declaration of assets and liabilities as required by law is not disclosing the information they have provided in the declarations. I find that the argument advanced on that basis had also been an attempt to frustrate the purposes of the RTI Act. I am of the view that it is not open to any Information Officer or a Designated Officer of a public authority to deny information to frustrate the very intention of the Legislature when the RTI Act was enacted in order to expand the scope of combating corruption, promoting accountability and good governance.” Thereby, Court held that the provisions of the RTI shall prevail over the provisions of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law when it comes to providing information as required by the RTI, subjected to the limitation imposed in terms of Section 5 of the RTI Act.

Addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday (28), Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said the Cabinet approved the combined proposal, presented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Power and Energy, to proceed in becoming a party to those conventions. “In accordance with that decision, a steering committee and nine action committees have been appointed to study matters related to electricity generation using nuclear energy. The International Atomic Energy Agency has given its recommendations regarding the self-assessment report prepared by the working groups and it is possible to proceed with the nuclear power generation project in line with the recommendations,” he said. Speaking further he said the Cabinet also approved to expand market opportunities for Jet A-1 Aviation Fuel. “The Jet A-1 Aviation Fuel is currently supplied by the Sri Lanka Petroleum Corporation. Due to the foreign exchange crisis that the country is currently facing, the operations of Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery, where Jet A-1 fuel is produced, has been disrupted and the import of Jet A-1 fuel has also become a challenge for Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). Due to this, the supply of Jet A-1 fuel required for the cargo and passenger flights has been disrupted and as a result the focus has to be on alternative measures to supply the required Jet A-1 fuel for those aircraft,” he said. Gunawardena also noted that it has been accepted that giving the opportunity to supply Jet-A fuel to Sri Lanka, under the maximum supply limits, to the parties who supply Jet A-1 aviation fuel to the other countries, is more appropriate. It will not to hinder the supply of fuel produced at Sapugaskanda Refinery. Therefore, the Cabinet approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Power and Energy to give that opportunity to other parties who are capable of supplying jet A-1 fuel to the country. Meanwhile, the Cabinet also approved the pilot project to operate Battery powered electric buses. Gunawardena said it is appropriate to introduce buses operating on solar energy to reduce the cost of importing fossil fuels and to face the international energy crisis. “The Minister of Transport and Highways presented the implementation of a public-private partnership project for the operation of battery powered electric buses, by the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), covering the Western Province. This project will be centred on the commercial cities of the Colombo and Gampaha District. The Cabinet approved the implementation of a pilot project based on a formal feasibility study,” he said.

Despite Adani Group of India, which purchased a 51 per cent stake in the West Container Terminal (WCT), coming under fire by a research group for allegedly using opaque accounting methods and inflating its financial metrics to hide its debt levels and generate higher profits, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority said the WCT development project is moving forward as planned and that the allegations have had no impact on the project. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone signed a BOT agreement with its local partner John Keells Holdings PLC and the SLPA for the USD 700 million worth project in September 2021. SLPA Managing Director, Susantha Abeysiriwardana told Ceylon Today that the project is expected to be partially operational by 2025 and fully operational by 2027. Adani Group and its partners will develop and operate the terminal for a period of 35 years. He added that the development project is exempted from VAT, and no tax regulations would impact it. Adani Port’s investment for WCT is USD 700 million, of which 70 per cent is a loan obtained by the joint venture as agreed.   Adani Group is facing severe criticism over allegations by Hindenburg Research.   Hindenburg Research is a short-selling research firm that investigates companies and publicly trades. In their research findings, they claimed Adani Group‘s founder and Chairman, Gautam Adani, who is one of the wealthiest people in India, had built a complicated web of front companies and subsidiaries to siphon money and inflate revenue. The Adani Group has denied the allegations made against it and has initiated legal action against the company that made the allegations, claiming that the report was aimed at damaging the company’s reputation and causing a drop in its stock price. Hindenburg Research had previously released a report in 2020 on Nikola Corporation, which alleged that the company had misled investors and that its founder, Trevor Milton, had made false statements about the company’s technology.

Speaking at the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday (28), Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardana said Cabinet approval was granted to implement a programme to distribute Nadu rice that has been purchased by the Government for Rs 100 per kg to ensure a fair price for the paddy farmer, among low-income earners free of charge. He said in addition to the amount paid to the farmer per kilo of paddy, the paddy producers pointed out that an amount of approximately Rs 6 or 7 has to be spent on 1 kg of rice as Social Security Levy. This is apart from the additional cost that has to be borne for water, electricity, storage and transport until the final product is handed over to the customer. “They also pointed out that the farmers could be provided with a higher price and a certain concession can be granted to minimise the production cost. Considering these facts, Cabinet approved the proposal tabled by the President to revise the Social Security Contribution Levy Act No. 25 of 2022 to release the purchase of paddy, rice production, and marketing. This will ensure a price higher than Rs 100 for 1 kg of Nadu rice,” he said.  By Thameenah Razeek"

He warned that protests were to be carried out in 12 districts where GMOA members would actively participate.

Addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday (28), Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said the Cabinet approved the combined proposal, presented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Power and Energy, to proceed in becoming a party to those conventions. “In accordance with that decision, a steering committee and nine action committees have been appointed to study matters related to electricity generation using nuclear energy. The International Atomic Energy Agency has given its recommendations regarding the self-assessment report prepared by the working groups and it is possible to proceed with the nuclear power generation project in line with the recommendations,” he said. Speaking further he said the Cabinet also approved to expand market opportunities for Jet A-1 Aviation Fuel. “The Jet A-1 Aviation Fuel is currently supplied by the Sri Lanka Petroleum Corporation. Due to the foreign exchange crisis that the country is currently facing, the operations of Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery, where Jet A-1 fuel is produced, has been disrupted and the import of Jet A-1 fuel has also become a challenge for Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). Due to this, the supply of Jet A-1 fuel required for the cargo and passenger flights has been disrupted and as a result the focus has to be on alternative measures to supply the required Jet A-1 fuel for those aircraft,” he said. Gunawardena also noted that it has been accepted that giving the opportunity to supply Jet-A fuel to Sri Lanka, under the maximum supply limits, to the parties who supply Jet A-1 aviation fuel to the other countries, is more appropriate. It will not to hinder the supply of fuel produced at Sapugaskanda Refinery. Therefore, the Cabinet approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Power and Energy to give that opportunity to other parties who are capable of supplying jet A-1 fuel to the country. Meanwhile, the Cabinet also approved the pilot project to operate Battery powered electric buses. Gunawardena said it is appropriate to introduce buses operating on solar energy to reduce the cost of importing fossil fuels and to face the international energy crisis. “The Minister of Transport and Highways presented the implementation of a public-private partnership project for the operation of battery powered electric buses, by the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), covering the Western Province. This project will be centred on the commercial cities of the Colombo and Gampaha District. The Cabinet approved the implementation of a pilot project based on a formal feasibility study,” he said.

Despite Adani Group of India, which purchased a 51 per cent stake in the West Container Terminal (WCT), coming under fire by a research group for allegedly using opaque accounting methods and inflating its financial metrics to hide its debt levels and generate higher profits, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority said the WCT development project is moving forward as planned and that the allegations have had no impact on the project. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone signed a BOT agreement with its local partner John Keells Holdings PLC and the SLPA for the USD 700 million worth project in September 2021. SLPA Managing Director, Susantha Abeysiriwardana told Ceylon Today that the project is expected to be partially operational by 2025 and fully operational by 2027. Adani Group and its partners will develop and operate the terminal for a period of 35 years. He added that the development project is exempted from VAT, and no tax regulations would impact it. Adani Port’s investment for WCT is USD 700 million, of which 70 per cent is a loan obtained by the joint venture as agreed.   Adani Group is facing severe criticism over allegations by Hindenburg Research.   Hindenburg Research is a short-selling research firm that investigates companies and publicly trades. In their research findings, they claimed Adani Group‘s founder and Chairman, Gautam Adani, who is one of the wealthiest people in India, had built a complicated web of front companies and subsidiaries to siphon money and inflate revenue. The Adani Group has denied the allegations made against it and has initiated legal action against the company that made the allegations, claiming that the report was aimed at damaging the company’s reputation and causing a drop in its stock price. Hindenburg Research had previously released a report in 2020 on Nikola Corporation, which alleged that the company had misled investors and that its founder, Trevor Milton, had made false statements about the company’s technology.

Prior to that period, Sri Lanka suffered at least a year-long drought, impacting Yala 2016, Maha 2016/2017 and Yala 2017, respectively, not least cheap hydroelectricity generation.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

There was a suggestion to dispose of these, but I was informed that among these are standard cosmetics too,” he said.

In light of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) sessions, beginning in Geneva next month, the HRCSL, led by its Chairperson retired Supreme Court Judge Rohini Marasinghe, visited the Northern Province from 16 to 18 February and concluded their mission by presenting a report with number of rights-related recommendations to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The main concern of the Commission was to address the disparity between the North and the South on the security issue. On the Truth Commission, the HRCSL said that the Act of Parliament, establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, constituted under the powers of Parliament, should be equipped with sufficient powers to function independently and transparently and to address issues placed before them without any political interference. The Truth Commission, the HRCSL said, must be able to build the trust and confidence of the victims and/or the families of the victims from its inception, or the Government should take steps to do so as a precondition to the establishment of the Commission. To build the trust and confidence of the victims and their families, it is fundamental that issues pertaining to land, enforced disappearances and missing persons and long-term detainees are meaningfully addressed and resolved by the government as a threshold concern, the report said. The Commission observed that there were conflicting views from the participants about the central purpose of a truth commission. The Commission also expressed concern about persons detained under Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), some of whom have been held for more than 14 years, which was a gross violation of their fundamental human rights under the Constitution and a violation of their rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The HRCSL also recommended that the Parole Board take cognizance of the nature of the offence committed and the behaviour of the convicted prisoners mentioned and advise the authority to refer for a pardon or for a nolle prosequi for those awaiting the conclusion of the trial whenever it deems appropriate. The Commission recommended these matters to the Ministry in charge of the prisoners for an appropriate solution. As such, it has now become relevant and urgent concerning the issue of reconciliation. The HRCSL also recommended to the government the strengthening of border control, by the Navy, along the coast, island-wide. It also recommended to have a consistent security policy applicable to all provinces in the country dependent on the intelligence data collected by the Security Council and the policy of the government on the national security of the people in Jaffna. The HRCSL said there was severe harassment, by the Military, caused to the people crossing the checkpoints, through body searches on women or directing passengers to alight from the buses and / unload goods from the lorries. Also the HRCSL observed that an identification pass system for fishermen in Mannar to fish is a violation of a fundamental right. The Commission observed that the livelihood of farmers concerning cultivation and livestock rearing is disrupted, as their lands are primarily in the possession of the military, Wildlife and Forest Department, and Archaeological Department.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

This was when the Petition was taken before Supreme Court Justices Yasantha Kodagoda, S.Thurairaja and Priyantha Fernando. While Additional Solicitor General Nerin Pulle requested Court to fix the case for 11 May, President’s Counsel Upul Jayasuriya, appearing on behalf of the Petitioner, requested for it to be fixed on an earlier date before 9 March, which was when the Local Government Election was initially due to be held, considering it a matter of urgency. Thereby Court fixed the Petition to be taken up on 3 March. Meanwhile, President’s Counsel Upul Jayasuriya also requested for a Judge-Bench devoid of Justice S. Thurairaja on the basis that he had already formed an opinion on a similar matter before the same Court in regard to the Local Government Election. Justice Thurairaja however opposed such statement on the basis that he had not formed any opinion and that he had not favoured any case. While stating that such statement is unfair, Justice S. Thurairaja said that each case has been decided based on the facts and submissions made before Court. It was noted in the Petition that the failure to provide funds for the Local Government Election, notwithstanding the fact that an estimated sum of Rs 10 billion has been allocated to the Election Commission for conducting elections, other than parliamentary elections, under the Activity Budget Estimates for the fiscal year of 2023 and/or Budget for the year 2023 is a violation of Fundamental Rights. It was also stated that the Minister of Finance has no mandate by the people of Sri Lanka to act in such a dictatorial manner disregarding democratic values that are enshrined in the Constitution. He thereby sought an interim order, restraining the respondents and relevant authorities from withholding any funds allocated by the Activity Budget Estimates for the purpose of conducting the Local Government Polls 2023. He also sought an order to be issued to tender the circular prohibiting the financing of the Local Government Polls 2023. Nine, including the Secretary to the Treasury of the Ministry of Finance, Commissioner General of Elections, Chairman of the Election Commission, members and the Attorney General were named as respondents to the Petition.

Jaffna Teaching Hospital Director Dr.T. Sathyamoorthy yesterday (27), when contacted, said the hospital was trying to get a separate incinerator installed, while the operation of the incinerator, at Thellipalai, had been temporarily stopped for repairs.  He said the issue with regard to the incinerator had been discussed with the Jaffna City Council, while an area had been identified in Gombeyan Mayanan, where clinical waste from Hospital would have to be discarded, without causing harm to the people of that particular area.  Dr. Sathyamoorthy said that he had received a letter from the Governor’s Office a week earlier, saying the place identified in Gombeyan Mayanan was unsuitable for setting up the incinerator and that an alternate place should be selected. “Since the matter is still under discussion with the Governor of the Northern Province and remains to be resolved, steps have been taken to incinerate the hospital’s medical waste through private companies. The Hospital generates about 400 tonnes of clinical waste daily. While natural waste is processed, plastics are handed over to the Municipal Council. He said that cardboard and bottles that get collected were sold outside the hospital.  Dr. Sathyamoorthy noted that setting up of an incinerator and operating it required a certain amount of funds. Similarly, medical waste is not allowed to accumulate in the hospitals, so that it does not harm the people. “The public need not be afraid, as measures have been taken to incinerate clinical waste by giving it to private sector companies.” The TH Director reassured. Authorities at Thellipalai BH, when contacted said there had been a few issues with the incinerator, so much so that, some of the waste items remained as the combustion process did not occur as it should. They said that there was an issue with the standard of the mechanism so that the Jaffna TH had called for its repair. Meanwhile, informed sources yesterday (27) said that till recently the Tellipalai Base Hospital incinerator had also disposed waste of the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, and Jaffna District.  Being faced with the recurring problem of the incinerator, there had been attempts to send the waste from Jaffna for disposal in Vavuniya, much to the annoyance of the politicians of that District. Earlier, waste from Jaffna TH had even been disposed of at a no- man’s land in Ariyalai, in the suburbs of Jaffna District. However there had been severe opposition from the people in the area – specially when they had sourced the garbage to the Jaffna TH.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

He said a stock of cosmetics and beauty tools, stored in four containers at the port, will be sold in a public auction. These containers are stuck at the Port as the importers have not followed certain regulations. Siyambalapitiya revealed this to the media after a programme in Dehiowita. “With the ban on imports, the Government had to stop the release of 1,500 containers. Some containers were released later and there are still 650 containers still stuck. Also, cosmetics that were previously banned were later granted approval by the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and the Sri Lanka Tourism Board,” he said. Speaking further, the State Minister said when the approval was obtained from those two institutions, the middlemen who make their living from cosmetics faced several difficulties. “As a result, a circular is being prepared to solve these types of issues. Customs in Sri Lanka Ports have halted the release of four containers of cosmetics and beauty tools, because they were imported from the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Dubai and China without proper approval. There was a suggestion to dispose of these, but I was informed that among these are standard cosmetics too,” he said. Siyabalapitiyam said after informing the President, steps were taken to check the quality of the cosmetics."

They demand that the President and the government refrain from acting in a way that undermines the Election Commission’s legally mandated and constitutionally valid local government elections. “It is now clear that this pressure comes from within the government, specifically the executive branch and we condemn attempts, by certain powerful members of the political and bureaucratic elite, to undermine the people’s franchise, sovereignty, and representative democracy giving the economic crisis as an excuse,” they said in an official statement released recently. The signatories include, A.M. Faaiz, Aruna Shantha Nonis, Austin Fernando, Bernard Edirisinghe, Bhavani Fonseka, Dr. Brito Fernando, Dr. Maduranga Kalugampitiya, Dr. Rajan Rajasingham, Dr. Mario Gomez, Dr. Ramesh Ramaswamy, Nimal Chandrasena, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Dr. Vinya Ariyaratne, Fr. Jeewantha Peiris, Gamini Viyangoda, Jehan Perera, Joe William Jude Fernando, Lionel Bopage, President’s Counsel M.A. Sumanthiran, Prof. Jayadeva Uyangoda, Nuwan Bopage, Prof Neil DeVotta, Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy, Ruki Fernando and Rajan Hoole. They further noted, “with the socio-economic challenges posed by the economic upheaval, we must rally together to counter initiatives to undermine the democratic processes, people’s franchise, and popular sovereignty. We note that mismanagement of the political front by undermining the democratic process can only deepen political instability. It will in turn impact adversely the recovery from the present economic crisis,” they said in the statement. They reminded the President, the government, and public servants of their constitutional obligation to extend the fullest support and cooperation to the Election Commission to fulfil its constitutional duty of conducting free and fair elections and concluding the local government election as scheduled. “We therefore earnestly urge the President and the government, public service officials and others to refrain from any action or inaction that would subvert the democratic process.” They emphasised to the country’s political leadership that playing with the people’s franchise and democratic rights for partisan gains has in the past caused huge political and social costs. “The United Front Government in 1975 manipulated the Constitution and the judiciary to stay in power for two more years only to suffer an unprecedented electoral disaster in 1977. A few years later, the United National Party Government of 1977 manipulated the Constitution in 1982 to extend the life of the Parliament for another full term through a referendum, instead of holding the constitutionally due parliamentary election. This blatant constitutional and institutional manipulation to legalise an unconstitutional and illegitimate political ambition, soon plunged the entire country into a protracted violent conflict, causing unprecedented political instability and suffering to the people. Sri Lankan citizens are still struggling to recover from the social, economic and political aftershocks of that most arbitrary act of political manipulation carried out by a government leadership for narrow, selfish and partisan gains.” The civil society demanded that all members of the public service fulfil their constitutional obligation of facilitating the local government election as scheduled, without allowing themselves to commit illegal acts under undue and unethical pressure. Also, they urged the international community to encourage the government to guarantee that the Sri Lankan citizens exercise their right to franchise without any hindrance. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Report of the Board of Inquiry(BOI) prepared by a three-member committee headed by Admiral of the Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda to ascertain lapses by the Armed Forces and State Intelligence Services during the recent incident of violence was filed before the Court of Appeal by Attorney, Uditha Igalahewa. The Report of the Board of Inquiry to Ascertain Lapses if any, by the Armed Forces and State Intelligence Service during May 2022 cited these observations. It showed that furthermore, no clear instructions had been issued regarding action to be taken to quell mob violence, which amounts to wilful neglect of duty. The report said, as a result, the troops on the ground could not prevent the damage to public property and harm to persons. It said, the Army Commander had taken the initiative away from the ground Commandeers to take appropriate action to quell mob violence as and when the ground situation demanded. A grey area exists in the conduct of Silva on 31 March 2022 and particularly on 9 May 2022 which is questionable to the board. One of the reasons cited is that Silva tried to justify his actions through the media by giving an interview to a Sinhala newspaper on 29 May 2022 knowing well that there is a BOI already appointed to look into the incidents, thereby undermining the purpose of the BOI. For what purpose over 4,500 troops of Air Mobile Brigade, Special Forces and Commandos were brought by Silva to Colombo and were not deployed on time to save the Prime Minister, his family and others who were trapped inside Temple Trees. Meanwhile, the report also showed that violence took place on 9 May 2022 afternoon along Galle Road and Galle Face could have been mitigated if not prevented, if the Secretary of Defence acted upon the INT report hand delivered to his residence on a Sunday by the SIS at 5 pm on 8 May 2022 followed up with a WhatsApp message on the following morning. However, the IGP had acted on the same INT report, which had been copied to him and delivered at 4.30 pm on which report he has deployed the Police. However, due to miscommunication and poor assessment of the evolving ground situation, the number of policemen deployed was not sufficient to deal with the situation effectively. The three Services (and the Police) had displayed a lack of training Aid to Civil Power. Furthermore, most of the Riot Control units were not properly equipped to deal with violent mobs. The Armed Forces and the Police had shown a reluctance to apply minimum force to quell activity of the rioters due to fear of prosecution. The Board concludes that the lack of legal protection afforded to Operational Troops for lawful actions has resulted in reluctance to act decisively at a time of necessity."

Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thera, at the Sri Dalada Maligawa claimed that various organisations and institutions, at local and international level are conspiring to destroy Buddhism, and in order to overcome these challenges, all Buddhists around the world must unite and work towards a common goal, rather than being divided into Theravada, Mahayana, and Tantrayana. He said Sri Lanka, where the Theravada Buddhist philosophy has been protected, will be affected by this impact and that at this time, despite sectarian differences, the Maha Sangha, as a whole, will be able to overcome these challenges by working together. The Mahanayaka Thera was speaking during a visit by Dhanawardena Guruge, who was appointed as the Samagi Jana Balavegaya’s head of Buddhist Affairs. He said the Buddhist philosophy provides the foundation for Buddhists to coexist in this country and that conspiracies against the Buddhist philosophy should be defeated by maintaining that unity and harmony. Guruge also received the blessings of the Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwathu Chapter. He also paid homage to the Sri Dalada Maligawa. Guruge said he will use his position to expand Buddhist religious work he has done in various parts of Sri Lanka, such as Bodh Gaya in India. He pointed out that he held such responsibilities during Ranasinghe Premadasa’s presidency and that he was a vital cog to the development of religious harmony among all sections of the population.

He also said the Government had dispatched military personnel to Nepal and they were dispatched during natural disasters. “But I am looking at the possibility of using our military medical personnel to send abroad when people are faced with health disasters. These occur more frequently than natural disasters, and I will discuss this with the military to set up a unit in this regard. “That’s a new chapter in military medicine,” he said. Wickremesinghe also said, under the Indian credit line,  the Government is to get more medicine to address the shortage of medicine during this crisis situation. He added the Government was working on making more foreign exchange available to the medical sector. He further said discussions were in progress with the Ministry of Health to upgrade the Medical Research Institute (MRI) as one of the best medical research laboratories in the region. He said it is discussed to introduce a health insurance scheme where the Government can assist those in the low income category, when they need to get the services of the growing private hospitals in the country.. The President said, the Government was seeking the possibility of introducing paying wards in Government hospitals and to introduce non-paying wards in private hospitals where the Government will take the tab for treatment in non-paying wards in private hospitals. The Army, Navy and Air Force medical Corps comprise experienced officers in military medicine and could rise to the occasion like during the separatist war in the North and East. While facing the war they also rendered a service during the tsunami catastrophe in 2004, during floods and during Covid-19. Hence, they are experienced in both the military and civilian fields. He said, he appreciates the commendable service that has been rendered in Military Medicine in the country. He added that the SLCOMM which commenced in 2016 has blossomed into a fully-fledged medical organisation. The President commended the contribution of past presidents and the present president of SLCOMM made towards military medicine in the country.  "

Speaking about holding a Presidential Election, he said somebody has reportedly misled the President that he can hold the Presidential Election after 18 November 2023.  “He does not want to hold any other election before the Presidential Election because the Government will face a humiliating defeat in any other election and it would have a negative impact on the Presidential Election.

He said, this decision should be taken by Cabinet, and that they will go to Court with the election candidates who applied for leave as State employees. He was speaking at a media briefing held at the PHU Headquarters on Wednesday (22). “State employees who contest the LG Polls have obtained no pay leave under the provisions of law. However, when they obtained the no pay leave, they expected the Government to hold the election within seven weeks from the conclusion of nominations as per the Local Authorities Elections Act. According to the Doctrine of Legitimate Expectation, when the people have taken a decision relying on the government’s decisions, they will be entitled for compensation if the Government changes its decision. Hence, unless the Government decides to pay salaries of the contesting State employees immediately, we will file legal action against the Government,” he said. Speaking about holding a Presidential Election, he said somebody has reportedly misled the President that he can hold the Presidential Election after 18 November 2023.  “He does not want to hold any other election before the Presidential Election because the Government will face a humiliating defeat in any other election and it would have a negative impact on the Presidential Election. That is why the President wants to postpone the LG Election by one year. According to Article 31(3A) (a), the President can declare his intention to seek a second term after completion of four years of his first term. The presidential term completes four years on 18 November 2023. However, sub-section (e) of the same article says that a President who was not elected by the people is not entitled to exercise this right. Therefore, the President cannot hold the Presidential Election this year as expected,” he said. By Thameenah Razeek"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Professionals from over 40 trade unions demonstrated holding placards and shouting slogans outside the Fort Railway Station yesterday (22), obstructing vehicular traffic. Protesters then took to a stage which had been erected for those gathered and members of the public who were present in Fort, accusing the President and the Government of turning a deaf ear while pretending that no action could be taken to amend the Act. Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe said changes beneficial to the 225 Parliamentarians had been introduced subsequently when all along the President and the Government had been stressing that no changes could be made to the Inland Revenue Act. “What did the IMF have to say to that,” he queried? Rushed amendments were introduced to safeguard the vehicles, fuel and chauffeurs of the Parliamentarians, he alleged. “Therefore, if the President and State authorities are unwilling to be flexible and amend the Act ,so that it would be fair, all professional trade unions will take the strike to the next level by next week,” he warned. Trade unionists from the University, Information Technology, Banking, Inland Revenue, Ports and Shipping, Dockyard, Ports Authority, Electricity and Water Boards addressed the rally. Meanwhile, GMOA Media Committee Member, Dr. Thanigaivasan Ratnasingam, when contacted, said the meeting they had been expecting to have with the President had not materialised. “Even if the Government had reached agreement with the IMF to impose taxes, the money which gets collected from it does not amount to much,” he said.

The President said this during an event held in his honour yesterday (22) at Royal College, Colombo. President Wickremesinghe is an alumnus of the school. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, who is also a Royalist and the President’s classmate, attended the event. “This is what I learnt at Royal College, do what is right and do what is good for your country. Remember that. Every decision I have taken, I have thought twice or thrice on what is the burden it will impose on us. How unpopular should I become? Should I even take this decision? And when I felt that it was in the country’s interest, I took it because my first task is to revive the economy. We can’t be a bankrupt country. We can’t be a beggar nation, so we have to learn that there are hard decisions to be taken in life. And I assure you, we will by this year, see a very good improvement in our economic condition and then we will set the stage for the economic recovery of this country, not to go back to an old system which brought us down, but to a new system,” he said. President Wickremesinghe also urged all citizens, including politicians, professionals, teachers, those engaged in agriculture, the business community, and members of the Security Forces, Police and civil servants, to work together to overcome the present economic crisis and promote reconciliation efforts. The President called on the present generation of Royalists to dedicate themselves to serving the country and transforming it into a place where they would like to reside. He urged young Royalists to take up the challenge and shape the future of the nation. President Wickremesinghe also highlighted that Royalists are trained to live in harmony with all races and religions, emphasising that the country cannot be divided on the basis of race or religion. He invited all politicians who are also Royalists to collaborate with the Government in its efforts to revive the country’s collapsed economy, emphasising that it was not a political invitation, but rather a call for a collective effort to address the economic crisis. “Royal College today has in its records, four Prime Ministers and two Presidents. This is an outstanding record for any school. We also have a Sultan of Maldives who was also a Prime Minister, Muhammad Fareed Didi and the man who modernised the Maldives, President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom spent a year or more at Royal College. I think the disease of modernisation; he must have gotten from Royal College. Now, we are here as the Royalists from the same class. So this is what education at Royal has brought us and I hope you will do even better than us. That is my hope. Records are meant to be broken. Are any of you willing to break that record?” When we gained independence, we were second to Japan and the London Times said we will be another Switzerland. That is who we were. Today, we are a country which has only Afghanistan below us. We don’t know what the future is. So, when we build this future, it’s an economy that must last for 25 years. It must be a new Constitution that must last for 100 years. It must be a society not for us. None of us here are going to live for 25 years. It is a country for you all, he said.

Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena participated in the event. Other dignitaries present were State Minister of Higher Education Dr. Suren Raghavan, State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya and Heads of Diplomatic Missions and UN and international organisations. People from all walks of life including academia, intellectuals, political and cultural personalities, top government officials as well as hundreds of students and scouts from schools islandwide also joined the observance. On this occasion, the Independence Square turned into a grand assembly of different language speakers. The Prime Minister and other dignitaries scribbled in respective mother tongues their feelings about the Day on canvas with brush and paint. The programme began with the choral rendition of the immortal Ekushey song by the children of the High Commission officials and their family members. The entire hall stood in solemn silence for one minute as a mark of respect to the Language Martyrs. To mark the day, under the patronage of the High Commission and with the assistance of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Education, an islandwide creative writing and painting competition for children was launched two months back on the theme ‘Mother Language: Unity in Diversity.’ In yesterday’s event, the winners of the competition were awarded. The day’s attraction was an absorbing multilingual cultural performance by students and performers of the Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre, Russian House in Colombo, Maldivian Educational and Cultural Centre, Iranian Cultural Centre, SAARC Cultural Centre, Bangladesh High Commission and singers from Sri Lanka. In song, recitation and dance forms in as many as eight languages, they showcased their respective cultural traditions and love for their mother tongue and mother land. The finale was a K-pop performance. All the items drew huge appreciation from the crowd. In his welcome remarks, High Commissioner of Bangladesh Tareq Md Ariful Islam reflected on the significance of the day, shared its historical perspective and emphasised the role of mother tongues in promoting an inclusive society and a peaceful world. State Minister of Higher Education Dr. Raghavan spoke in three languages–English, Sinhala and Tamil, about the importance of preservation of mother languages and linguistic diversity. UN Resident Coordinator Sarat Das spoke about the significance of multilingualism.  The event was organised in partnership with the Ministry of Education of Sri Lanka, United Nations in Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka Scout Association. A blood donation camp was also arranged by the High Commission in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Scout Association at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University Hospital. The day’s in-house observance began at the Chancery early morning with ceremonial hoisting of the National Flag at half-mast followed by a one-minute silence, special prayers and reading out messages of high dignitaries of Bangladesh. "

It is Parliament that is responsible for addressing and improving the state of the economy and the upcoming LG Poll in not the means to change the current Government, the President added. During a meeting with businessmen and lawyers in the Kandy District, the President warned that if the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not provide financial assistance to the country, the people will have to endure a lot of difficulties like 12-hour power cuts, due to the non-availability of fuel and a shortage of fertiliser for the Yala season. The President revealed the progress of discussions with the IMF so far during the speech. Although Sri Lanka expected to deliver 15 tasks set up by the IMF by 15 February, for obtaining financial assistance, the country could not make it because ‘one person’ obstructed revising the electricity tariffs, which was one of the IMF tasks. As a result, getting IMF assistance was delayed by another six weeks, the President stressed. When a country goes bankrupt, it has to go to the International Monetary Fund. Apart from that, there is no other organisation in the world that provides aid when a country goes bankrupt. Each nation that experienced an economic catastrophe recovered after engaging in negotiations with the IMF. It took Greece 13 years to recover from the collapsed economy. I have no hope of being President for 13 years, he said. “The IMF indicates that our tax revenue should be 15 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product as it was in 2019. So far it has gone down to 9 per cent. They have asked us how we expect to get assistance from money collected from the people of other countries as taxes, while we are giving tax relief to our people. “The government started negotiations with the IMF last August. Accordingly, it was possible to agree on the staff level agreement in September. They assigned us 15 tasks to complete. The IMF gave us until 31 December 2022 to implement these tasks. But we couldn’t fulfil it. Then we made plans to get time until 31 January 2023. Even at that time, we failed complete those 15 tasks. Finally, the deadline was pushed back to 15 February. By 6.00 p.m. on 15 February, we completed all and sent the progress report to Washington. Only one of these fifteen issues was being delayed. It was related to the increase in electricity tariffs. The Electricity Board incurs Rs 230 billion each year in losses. According to the IMF, government taxes should not be used to support institutions. It was informed that if this occurs, the IMF will not provide assistance. However, one person in this country opposed the decision to increase the electricity tariff.“There is only one way to rebuild this collapsed economy. That is the International Monetary Fund,” the President said and added, however, different political parties are presenting different stories and he suggested that they inform him if there is another way to resurrect the collapsed economy. “Therefore, we are prepared to allow those who oppose our policies to meet the International Monetary Fund and submit proposals. It remains to be seen whether the International Monetary Fund will accept those proposals,” he added. “The IMF also suggested that all the countries should get on one platform and discuss the matter. However, as China is a world power, their procedure is different. Tomorrow (23) the Finance Ministers of the G20 countries are scheduled to hold a discussion in Bangalore, India. During the meeting it is expected to look into how to restructure the debt of countries whose economies have collapsed. There, I hope to discuss the debt restructuring method of Sri Lanka with the Chinese Finance Minister. As per their stand, we have two or three options to implement. “I took over this country when nobody else was willing to step up.  Despite the inevitable criticisms, I am committed to taking all necessary action to rebuild our economy. Our goal is to provide some relief to the people by the end of this year and begin our economic development plan at the start of next year. With a focused and sustained effort, we can build a strong and prosperous economy that benefits all citizens of our country,” he elaborated."

While claiming that street food stalls could be seen everywhere in the world, MP de Silva inquired why the food stalls are going to be removed. He advised that arbitrary decisions not be taken and requested to discuss the matters with the street food vendors and provide fair solutions. Responding to MP de Silva, Minister of Transport and Highways Bandula Gunawardena said attention was paid to the matter due to the risks posed to pedestrians and vehicles using the road. “We have considered the dangers posed to pedestrians and vehicles on the road. We have also identified 3,000 spots that are easily accessible to the public and are safer. Therefore, measures are being taken to remove any stall across Sri Lanka that is considered to pose a risk of accident to pedestrians as well as vehicles,” he said. Minister of Urban Development Prasanna Ranatunga said that initially business operations were conducted from Friday to Sunday, only. However, now the street food stalls are operational everyday and the stores on the other side of the road have filed complaints stating that they are unable to run their businesses as a result, he stressed. “Therefore, the UDA is looking at introducing a system for the street food stalls to follow when conducting business,” the Minister stated.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

Fielding questions Rohana said that majority of them had been established in places which did not have proper water supply and sanitation facilities. The lack of permanent staff, mainly due to poor wages, was another grievous problem faced by these hotels and eateries. This made it difficult for PHIs to ensure health condition of the food handlers serving in those eating houses and hotels. The situation was very prominent when comparing them with those food handling establishments which had permanent staff. During the survey, 27 per cent of establishments were detected as average in their food preparation. What the PHIUSL wants to accomplish is to upgrade the ‘C’ grade to ‘B’ grade by providing them with the guidelines, regulating those institutions and “we would also have to take legal action against those who fail to comply,” Rohana warned. He noted that inspections carried out during the survey had also shown that 55 per cent of eateries and hotels in the country were of good quality.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

It is also the widely used illegal drug by young people. “Despite the claims of medical benefits, there are many health harms from cannabis, including mental disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, cannabis use disorders and serious lung ailments,” they pointed out noting that it also affected the brain development of adolescents and was associated with self-harm, suicide and road traffic accidents, one of the major killers in Sri Lanka.

The SLMA President and the Expert Committee Chairman noted the danger of promoting use of cannabis by giving it the level of publicity it receives now. “As you may be aware, there is a concerted effort to promote cannabis through social media. The current publicity relating to decriminalisation and legalising will ensure a synergistic effect, resulting in normalising cannabis use,” they warned. Evidence shows that such publicity related to one substance could lead to increase in use of other substances as well, the duo added.  "

This follows Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp’s and Taisei Corp’s decision to withdraw from Colombo due to incompatible business and economic climates. Mitsubishi is expected close its operation at the end of March and to operate from one of its offices in the South Asian regions. State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe tweeted that he met the JICA Director General yesterday (20) and reiterated that the reforms that should have been carried out over many years, are now being carried out progressively. Further, he noted he was happy to note that JICA will extend their fullest support to Sri Lanka’s recovery process and towards growth.  JICA which is a governmental agency of Japan, that provides development assistance to developing countries, also signed the construction of BIA’s Terminal-2 expansion deal, where Japanese’ Taisei Corporation Sri Lanka was involved, but suspended the project calling for an environment conducive for business and the government to restructure its debt as the government is not in a position to repay the loan.  JICA expressed it would withdraw from funding, but it would want the government to transfer the project to another Japanese company. There have been reports about a Chinese company expressing interest in the project. But the JICA loan is conditioned on the participation of only Japanese companies.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

Addressing a press conference, held at the Opposition Leader’s office in Colombo, Wickramaratne alleged that UNP leader and President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s actions recently implied two things: That he would not hold Local Government elections and that he would protect the Rajapaksas during the rest of his term, in whatever way he could.  He also said that this is the first time that an election has been obstructed by deviating from the Constitution and the law. “In the last Budget, Rs 10 billion was allocated for the election to be held in 2023. The talk that there is no money now is a blatant lie,” said Wickramaratne. Wickramaratne also said that from a historical perspective, the printing costs of the May 2010 Parliamentary Election were paid to the Government Press on 12 August 2010, i.e. four months later. Similarly, money was paid to the Government Press for the expenses of the Parliamentary Poll held on 17 August 2015 only on 21 October 2015. Likewise the printing costs for the 2019 Presidential Election were made to the Government Press only after eight months, he said. “In spite of these precedents, to declare that ballot papers cannot be printed without paying money in advance, despite having all the necessary resources for printing only for this election, is a premeditated lie to postpone the Local Government Election, he said. ‘The concerned officials should pay attention to the fact that the Sri Lanka Bar Association has warned them, including the Treasury Secretary and the Government Printer, not to engage in activities that sabotage the holding of the L.G. Election,” said Wickramaratne. He also warned that if the Executive President and Parliament decide to hold elections in the way they want, that is not only a violation of the law, but also the usurpation of the people’s right to sovereignty. As prescribed by Article 104 of the Constitution, “Every authority must support the Election Commissioner to hold an election when it is called and obstructing it is a criminal offence and punishable with imprisonment of public officials, especially heads of institutions, who have sworn to uphold the Constitution-must be mindful of its consequence,” said Wickramaratne. Therefore, he advised public officials to act honestly and thoughtfully, as there are many examples in the recent past where even if the politicians called them to their offices and warned, or even issued illegal orders, those officials ended up being punished for engaging in acts that are against the Constitution. “All members of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) were previously in the United National Party (UNP),’ said Wickramaratne. But Wickremesinghe has changed the UNP Constitution in such a way that he has made himself UNP leader for life, the SJB MP said. Therefore, to protect democracy, about 90 per cent of the MPs and members from the UNP, formed the SJB. (PA)"

During the visit, Wilcock met with poor rural communities to understand their food and nutrition needs, and how WFP’s US-funded programmes will help them overcome challenges brought on by the economic crisis.   As part of the visit, Wilcock travelled to Ratnapura, where she spoke with food-insecure families faced with high food prices and unemployment. The community will soon receive US-funded cash assistance through WFP worth LKR 20,000 (approximately US$ 55) for four consecutive months which will empower them with the choice to meet their essential needs in local markets, while also helping to boost the economy. “Sri Lanka continues to experience significantly high levels of food insecurity, affecting over 30 per cent of the population, most notably among the poor” said Gerard Rebello, Acting Country Director for WFP Sri Lanka. “We are extremely grateful for the invaluable support from the Government and people of the United States, which has been critical in enabling WFP to expand its emergency assistance. The funding from USAID will help WFP address humanitarian needs and prevent food insecurity from deteriorating further.” The United States has funded nearly one-third of Sri Lanka’s emergency operation requirement, with a contribution of US$ 20 million (LKR 7.3 billion) in 2022. The funds allow WFP to provide cash, food assistance and value vouchers to food-insecure families, and to support national food and nutrition programmes, including school meals and Thriposha, a fortified blended food product for pregnant and nursing mothers and young children.  USAID’s long-time support for the Government of Sri Lanka through WFP has helped improve the country’s capacity in disaster risk management, particularly against natural hazards. During the trip, Wilcock also visited an emergency operations centre in Ratnapura to observe how US funding has enabled district-level emergency coordination systems development. Wilcock was given an overview of how the centre provides timely information to safeguard communities from natural hazards such as floods and landslides. WFP, with funding from donors like the US, has reached two million people since June 2022 through its emergency operation, with plans to reach 3.4 million people with food and nutrition assistance in the coming months."

The poll was conducted as a part of the syndicated survey instrument by Verité Research also provides other organisations the opportunity to survey the sentiments of Sri Lanka. The poll results are Government approval rating:  To the question, “Do you approve or disapprove of the way the current government is working?” only 10 per cent said they approve (with an error margin of ± 2.04 per cent). This is the same extreme low level as it was in October 2022. In June 2022 the approval rating was at an all-time low of 3 per cent. Sri Lanka satisfaction: To the question, “In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in Sri Lanka?” only 4 per cent said they were satisfied (with an error margin of ± 1.50 per cent). This rating was at 7 per cent in October 2022 and 2 per cent in June 2022. Economic confidence: Multiple choice questions on the condition and trajectory of the economy are used to generate an economic confidence score. The score can range from negative (-) 100 to positive (+) 100. A score above zero means more people see the economic conditions positively rather than negatively. If everyone thinks that the economy is in a poor condition (instead of good or excellent), and everyone also thinks it is getting worse (rather than better), then the score will be a (-) 100. In February 2023, 0.3 per cent rated the economic conditions as excellent, 6.0 per cent rate it as good; and 6.3 per cent rate it as getting better. The resulting score was a (-) 78.4 (rounded off as negative 78). This rating was (-) 78 in October, and (-) 96 in June.

Ceylon Workers’ Congress Leader, Minister Jeevan Thondaman, SLPP MP Premnath C. Dolawatte, SJB MP Mayantha Dissanayake and Freedom People’s Congress MP Prof. Charitha Herath shared their views during the discussion jointly hosted by NextGenSL and the Canadian High Commission to Sri Lanka. Attorney-at-Law Aritha Wickramasinghe, Equality Director of iProbono moderated the panel discussion. Premnath Dolawatte, who recently presented a Private Member’s Bill to Parliament seeking to decriminalise LGBTQ Sri Lankans, said he was hopeful that the majority of MPs in the House would support his Bill and join the effort to protect the rights of the LGBTQ community. “I know the ultimate fight should be for non-discrimination and decriminalisation of the LGBTQ community is only one aspect of it. But, we must start somewhere,” Dolawatte said, sharing his views at the event. Describing himself as an “untamed elephant,” the SLPP MP said he did not speak to the LGBTQ community before presenting his Private Member’s Motion to the House. “Consider this an act of an untamed elephant. I haven’t spoken to the LGBTQ community nor have I spoken to any foreign mission in Sri Lanka. I only did my part, as a lawmaker, to ensure the rights of citizens of my country,” he added. “Minister Ali Sabry has assured that the Government will support the motion. Minister Prasanna Ranatunga has also communicated to me that the ruling party will back the Bill. So, I am hopeful that the motion will secure a majority in Parliament. However, it is now with the Attorney General’s Department and those who are aware of the system know that getting a document out of the AG’s Department is no easy task. Also, getting a Private Member’s Bill passed in Parliament is also a time-consuming process. But, with your support, I am confident that we will be able to get this done,” Dolawatte said. MP Mayantha Dissanayake from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya said he was in favour of the Private Member’s Bill presented by Dolawatte. “We are a progressive party and we understand the need for change. I briefly spoke to our Party Leader, Sajith Premadasa, and shared my views on this matter with him. We haven’t made a formal policy statement on this yet, but we are in favour of this because we want to do the right thing by the country.” “When this is presented to Parliament, there will be stiff resistance from many quarters. That’s something we must expect. But I, as a Parliamentarian and a person who values human rights, will champion this cause within my party and within our parliamentary group. There are many countries in the world that have made progressive steps in this regard and we must follow those examples,” Dissanayake added. “Addressing the concerns of religious circles will be a critically important step and I am confident that we will be able to convince them by directly engaging with the right information. For instance, this is perfectly in line with the fundamental teachings of Buddhism such as compassion and that should be the basis of our engagement with Buddhist monks,” the MP said. “We inherited a country that needed change. We must now deliver,” Dissanayake said, adding that his traditional upbringing in Kandy would not deter him from supporting this cause. Joining the discussion, Freedom People’s Congress MP Prof. Charitha Herath said they will support decriminalisation of same-sex relations, if and when the Bill is presented to Parliament. “We must engage with two domains to achieve the desired results. One is the political domain and the other is the cultural domain. We can change old-fashioned political and cultural establishments through constant engagement,” Herath explained. “The technical approach alone will not usher in meaningful change. That is why I highlight the importance of cultural discussions as well to overcome the existing barriers. Sometimes, I feel that these cultural platforms are forgotten by the younger generation.” “If you look at this region, India has made significant progress in the recent past while we are lagging behind. We must explore the reasons for this and address them adequately,” the MP added. Minister Jeevan Thondaman, the youngest Cabinet Minister to hold office in Sri Lanka, countered the argument that culture was a barrier in achieving non-discrimination for the LGBTQ community in Sri Lanka. “There is more than enough evidence from ancient history that same-sex relations existed and they were very much embraced many, many centuries ago. There are ancient statues, literary works and many other things to prove this point. So, where did we go wrong?” Thondaman, the Leader of the Ceylon Workers’ Congress (CWC), queried. “The answer is quite clear. It is the colonisation and westernisation of our ancient civilisations. Their beliefs and values became a dominant factor and we lost many of ours.” “Culture has never been a barrier to us. It is the colonial mindset that has become a barrier. It is time we understand the reality,” he added. “I am a member of a minority community and a representative of a marginalised group of people, I request you to take these little victories. It will eventually lead you to the promised land. Ten years ago, a dialogue of this nature would not have been possible. Today, we are trying to sit with you and understand the gravity of this issue,” Thondaman said, pledging support to legislative reforms decriminalising same-sex relations. David Sood, Counsellor, Political and Trade from the Canadian High Commission to Sri Lanka delivered the opening remarks while Bhoomi Harendran and Kaushalya Sendanayaka Arachchi, a representative from Equal Ground shared observations from the civil society perspective."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/02/20/attention-must-be-paid-to-mental-health-of-schoolchildren-president/,Attention must be paid to mental health of schoolchildren – President,Author not found,0,2023-02-19T20:50:00+00:00,"President Ranil Wickremesinghe acknowledged that attention paid to mental health in schools was insufficient and that much more needs to be done for those with mental health issues and those who were differently-abled. He said one of the major issues confronting the country was a lack of trained personnel in this field. Wickremesinghe was speaking during a meeting with a youth group to discuss the Government’s Policy Statement and future plans and was responding to a query if Government would provide mental health education, particularly in schools. Shortcomings in the education sector were one of the major topics that were discussed, with the youth group emphasising the need for proper mental health education at school level as well as a proper education mechanism for the inclusion of the differently-abled. The President met a group of young people on 16 February to discuss his Policy Statement and the Government’s plans for the country’s future. During the conversation, they expressed their expectations of the Government and discussed a variety of issues. The youth group also brought up the issue of taxes, adding that while taxes were not a novel concept in many other countries, it was not so in Sri Lanka. The President explained that the Budget could be scrutinised and debated by Parliament to ensure the Government was adhering to it. He said there were many committees to study the Budget, such as the Committee on Public Enterprises, Committee on Public Accounts, and Public Finance Committee. He added the Parliamentary Budget Office Bill to strengthen the process further. They said, “Transparency is a big question with the new taxes. People are feeling it because suddenly they are forced to pay a huge portion of their salary.”  “Transparency is there because in a big Budget we have line items. If you read it, you can never say what it is. It’s in any budget, it’s Parliament that ensures the money is spent wisely, and it takes two to three years. So, Parliament must exercise its powers now. The last time, I think the Opposition didn’t fill their quota of the Chairman posts in oversight committees. So, all that passed by. Even this time around, during selection time, they did not come to Parliament. I think the rest who were present just got some opposition names into it. So, that is where the transparency comes in and nowhere else. You can ask them as to why the money is being spent and other relevant questions,” the President explained. The President also discussed the country’s economic situation and the challenges the Government faces, noting that Sri Lanka was facing an abnormal economic situation and had to restructure debt to get out of it. He added that the Government had to cut down on some expenditure and find money in other areas, such as raising electricity tariffs. The President acknowledged that it is not an easy job, but someone has to do it. “Sri Lanka was in an abnormal economic situation, and we had to get out of it. But to get out of it, we have to restructure debt. To restructure debt we had to cut down expenditure or find money for it. In some areas we have cut down, but in other areas, we have to find the money. Like yesterday we had to raise electricity tariffs because there is a Rs 230 billion loss. So, if you don’t raise it, you won’t have power. We are all paying for past sins. This is how we get out of it fast and this is what we have to do. I don’t think there’s any other way out. It’s not a job, that anyone would like to do, but someone has to do it,” he said. The youth group also raised the issue of individual accountability and suggested that parliamentarians should have some degree of education. The President agreed but noted that it will take some time for this to happen. He explained that many young people either have a Degree or business experience and it is up to the voters to choose the member they want. “Where individual accountability is concerned, MPs have a system where you can give a preference. If you don’t want any of them, you vote for the party and you can choose whom you want. However, it’s a very expensive procedure. So, I want to appoint Committee to look into how we can have a better system of Elections without spending the money we spend on Elections. In a parliamentary election, the bulk of the money is spent by individual candidates, not by the parties.” The youth also asked the President “Why does everyone shout in Parliament? Do you think they shout to avoid responding to questions posed to them?” In response, the President said that it is done to get media attention and was not appropriate. He said he has seen similar behaviour in other countries and that it was not unique to Sri Lanka. “That is bad. Now it’s done to get media attention. There are people when they argue, may shout at each other.  But, not like this, they just keep shouting. It’s setting a bad example to the country. There is a price. When we look at the UK, it is not so. There are times when people cheer but this is just being done. I think we have to bring some control over it,” he added. Overall, the meeting was an opportunity for the President to hear the views of the youth and discuss the Government’s future plans. The youth group expressed their concerns and ideas with the President who responded to questions and comments."

Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva and several top officials of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation and Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) participated in the event. The SLPA expects the daily operational capacity at the Trincomalee Port to increase with the commencement of Night Navigation Operations. At present, the Trincomalee Port is being developed to facilitate cement, mineral sand, and fuel imports. The adjoining lands will be utilised for port-related industries. The port, which was incurring losses until recently, has started generating record profits during the past six months. Under the latest development plans, ample opportunities are available in Trincomalee for a wide array of port-related investments, such as tank farms and LNG storage facilities. The SLPA points out the lands in the port’s vicinity could be well-utilised for these purposes. Trincomalee Harbour, a natural deep-water harbour, is considered the fifth largest natural harbour in the world. According to records, the Trincomalee Port was known as ‘Gokanna’ in ancient times. On 2 March 1815, Sri Lanka surrendered to the British, and with the recognition of the Trincomalee Port’s strategic positioning, the British set up a Royal Naval and Air Force base there. After independence in 1948, the Trincomalee Port was nationalised in 1967 and later vested in the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) in 1979. Despite its world-class recognition among industrial and tourist ports, the development and operations of the Trincomalee Port were hampered due to the rapid development of the Colombo Port and the lack of potential to perform night operations. Vessels calling at the port at night had to enter the following day, after anchoring in the outer harbour, which caused interruptions to port operations and its efficiency. The Sri Lankan Government and the Japanese Government entered into an agreement to implement grant aid under the Japanese Non-Project Grant Aid Programme 2017, also known as the Economic and Social Development Programme. As a result, this grant aid of 1 billion Japanese Yen was provided for the Night Navigation Operations Project at the Trincomalee Port, which included a state-of-the-art Vessel Traffic Management System, Radar Equipment, Lighthouse Equipment, 16 Navigation Buoys, two Mooring Buoys, two 400KV Generators, 14 Fire Pumps with machinery, and a Pilot Vessel provided by the Japan International Cooperation System (JICS) with the invaluable assistance of the Government and the People of Japan. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has implemented many programmes to attract more local and foreign investors to the port."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The electricity tariff increase was announced after the PUCSL informed the CEB on 15 February evening that they approved the hike, without its Chairman Janaka Ratnayake. Addressing the special media briefing yesterday (16), Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara said the entire country will receive uninterrupted power starting 16 February as the massive tariff hike made it possible now. He noted that with the approval of the electricity tariff revision, an additional loan of Rs 22 billion from the Bank of Ceylon (BoC) has granted to purchase coal. He also said the People’s Bank has informed that a loan of Rs 50 billion is possible. “It would have been easier for us if the proposal we made in January 2023, had been implemented in January itself. We can ensure a continuous supply of electricity from today (16). Also, we will receive the necessary funds through banks to import coal, fuel, and naphtha,” he said. Denying reports that the tariff increase was done to cover the CEB’s earlier losses, Minister said that was not the purpose of current tariff revision. “This is a difficult decision to make. The tariff increase was not intended to cover the CEB’s long-standing losses, but rather to manage ongoing costs. This tariff increase is cost-reflective. We had one condition in order to obtain that facility from the IMF. From 1 January, money from the Treasury or the Central Bank will no longer be given to State-run institutions like the CEB, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), and SriLankan Airlines,” he said. In addition, he highlighted that in previous years, CEB did not have enough money to run, but the Treasury assisted it by providing funds. “I do not believe that there will be another increase in the electricity tariff in the near future. By implementing this system, our Government hopes that the electricity supply will be maintained and that the burden will be reduced and the people’s electricity bill will be reduced through the next electricity tariff revision. The President advised us not only to ensure continuous electricity supply, but also to develop a suitable programme for these low-income families,” he said. In terms of assisting low-income families, he pointed out that the Ministries of Finance and Power and Energy will collaborate on a project for low-income people who use less electricity in the future. “It cannot be completed quickly. We will need some time. In addition, the President advised the implementation of a USD 100 Million credit line aimed at government-run educational institutions and all religious shrines. We will implement it within the next three months,” he said. The monthly electricity tariff of Rs 214 has been increased to Rs 753 for customers who consume up to 30 units of electricity per month. The monthly fixed charge for the lowest electricity tariff tier for up to 30 electricity units comprising nearly 1.45 million consumers has been increased to Rs 400 as part of that increase. The electricity tariff of Rs 677, which was between 31 and 60 units, has been increased to Rs 2,178, and the fixed charge is Rs 550. The electricity tariff of Rs 1,625, which was for between 61 and 90 units, has been increased to Rs 3,970, and the fixed tariff is Rs 650.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

India has provided USD 4 billion in assistance to its southern neighbour since the crisis hit early last year, but Sri Lanka is now seeking to enhance trade and investments as it moves to close a USD 2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, Sri Lankan High Commissioner in New Delhi, Milinda Moragoda has told Reuters. “We have to have growth, otherwise basically the economy will shrink,” Moragoda has said. “As far as growth is concerned, India offers that prospect. So we will have to move on that. Tourism from India, investment from India, integration with India. That’s what we have to do.” A key part of Sri Lanka’s economic recovery plan rests on developing its renewable energy resources in the island’s north, from where power can be transported into southern India through a cross-border transmission cable. The two countries resumed talks on linking their electricity grids last year, and Moragoda said a memorandum of understanding on the project would be signed within two months, which will be followed by a feasibility study. First proposed more than a decade ago, the project has made little progress so far. But Moragoda said Sri Lanka hoped to get the transmission line in place within two to three years so that renewable power produced on the island can be sold to India. “We need to have more sources of foreign exchange and electricity will be ideal,” he said. The neighbours will also start negotiations within weeks on enhancing an existing free trade agreement, Moragoda said, as part of a push by Sri Lanka to seal deals with key trading partners, including China and Thailand. “On our side, we are just about to nominate the (negotiations) team,” he said, adding that the focus would be on enhancing trade in sectors including textiles and garments, a major foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka. India is Sri Lanka’s biggest trading partner accounting for about $5 billion each in bilateral trade in 2021.  (Reuters)"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/02/16/air-india-unveils-historic-orders-for-470-jets/,Air India unveils ‘historic’ orders for 470 jets,Author not found,0,2023-02-15T20:50:00+00:00,"Air India has announced orders for a total of 470 Boeing and Airbus passenger jets as it races to tap surging demand for affordable air travel from the nation’s growing ranks of middle-class consumers. India’s largest international airline and second-largest domestic carrier is buying 220 Boeing aircraft valued at USD 34 billion and 250 passenger jets from European plane manufacturer Airbus. The Boeing purchase is the United States plane maker’s third-largest sale of all time, in dollar value, and its second of all time in quantity. US President Joe Biden called the agreement “historic” and discussed it by telephone with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The call was part of a flurry of high-level reactions as the scale of India’s needs provided a rare bonanza for the competing plane giants in an industry where the winner usually takes all. Air India is seeking to reinvent itself by expanding its operations and modernising its fleet. The new jets will help the airline’s owner, Tata Sons, compete against upstart discount rivals including India’s dominant carrier, IndiGo. “India is going to be the world’s third-largest market in the aviation sector,” Modi said in a videoconference with Tata Sons Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran and French President Emmanuel Macron. Over the next 15 years, it is estimated India will need more than 2,000 aircraft and “today’s historic announcement will help in meeting this growing demand,” he said. The Boeing order includes 190 737 Max aircraft, 20 of its 787s and 10 of its 777Xs. The purchase includes customer options for an additional 50 737 MAXs and 20 of its 787s, which would make it 290 aeroplanes for a total of USD 45.9 billion at list price. Toulouse, France-based Airbus will provide Air India with 40 wide-body A350 Airbus aircraft and another 210 narrow-body A320neo planes, Chandrasekaran said in the call. Airbus did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, which could be worth tens of billions of dollars. “Today is a historic moment for India, for Air India and for Airbus,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury, who was also on the call, said. The size of the order “demonstrates the appetite for growth in the Indian aviation industry. It’s the fastest growing in the world.” Chandrasekaran said the A350s will be used to “fly all ultra-long distance across the globe.” Single-aisle A320s are typically used on short-haul routes. He said the airline has “significant options” to increase its order. “It is important for the industry because given the recent turbulence in the China market, the alternative growth market is India,” said independent aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski. “India is also sending a strong political signal that it wants to remain attached to the West at a time when it has appeared ambiguous on Russian sanctions,” said Grabowski, a former banker with extensive experience in international deals. Demand for air travel in India and elsewhere in Asia has boomed over the past decade, fuelled by fast-growing economies that have raised incomes and made travel more affordable for millions of people. “There’s a lot of catch-up to do” for Air India, said Brendan Sobie, a Singapore-based independent aviation analyst. It is competing with newer budget airlines that moved faster to tap demand on domestic services as well as foreign carriers that are formidable competitors on international routes, he added. Tata Sons, India’s oldest and largest conglomerate, regained ownership of the debt-laden national carrier last year. The Tata Group pioneered commercial aviation in India when it launched the airline in 1932. It was taken over by the Government in 1953. Modi and Macron applauded the Airbus deal, with both saying it is a sign of the strengthening “strategic partnership” between their countries. Macron called the deal a “new success” and an opportunity to “develop new areas of cooperation with India.” Tata is integrating Air India with Vistara, which it jointly runs with Singapore Airlines, and with Air Asia India, which it runs with Malaysian discount operator Air Asia.

The objects may be “tied to commercial or research entities and therefore benign”, spokesman John Kirby said. US and Canadian officials have not yet located or recovered any wreckage from the three downed aircraft. Beijing earlier accused the US of “a trigger-happy overreaction”. China has denied one of its balloons, which was destroyed by a US fighter jet earlier this month off South Carolina, was being used for espionage, saying it was merely a weather-monitoring airship that had blown off course. At Tuesday’s daily news conference, Kirby said it will be difficult to determine the purpose or origin of the three other objects that were destroyed over Alaska, Canada and Michigan until the debris is found and analysed. “We haven’t seen any indication or anything that points specifically to the idea that these three objects were part of the PRC’s [People’s Republic of China] spying programme,” the White House National Security Council told reporters, “or that they were definitively involved in external intelligence collection efforts”.

United Airlines flight 1722 had left Maui on 18 December and was climbing when it suddenly plummeted 1,400ft (425m), reports say. It stabilised at just 775ft in altitude and went on to land safely in San Francisco 27 minutes early. It adds to a number of near misses involving planes this year. The flight was going normally until 71 seconds after take-off from Kahului Airport when it suddenly dropped in elevation, according to Flightradar24, an aviation website. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigates US plane crashes, will produce a report about the incident within three weeks. Passenger Rod Williams told CNN: “There were a number of screams on the plane. Everybody knew that something was out of the ordinary, or at least that this was not normal.” He said it was “sobering” to think they were probably about five seconds away from hitting the water. The flight’s pilots filed an internal safety report after landing, a United Airlines representative told BBC News. They have a combined 25,000 hours of flying experience. An investigation by the airline resulted in additional training for the pilots, which United said was ongoing. (BBC)"

The report in this connection also said that the main reason for the public to move away from using public transport is mainly due to unpleasant travelling experience. ‘Overcrowding needs to be eliminated by introducing sufficient numbers of buses along with appropriate time tabling and improving the human relations skills of the bus conductor, introducing an online payment system or an appropriate prepaid card system at least in urban areas to reduce congestion,  it said.  Commuters should also be able to use maps such as ‘Google transit maps’ to plan and connect their travel with major public transport modes, the report further recommended.

Speaking at a media briefing, the MP said with the Supreme Court’s decision last week, they hoped that the election process would run smoothly. He said they could see the ruling party and the party that the President represents interfering in the election process raising fears among the public in addition to the Government’s fear of facing the oncoming Election. “The people are supporting other parties and this ‘elephant-pohottu’ faction seriously opposes the oncoming Election because it is clear that they do not have the people’s mandate anymore. Anyone can label this Election as not that important as it is only for local government authorities. However, this Election is very important as it is being held at a critical juncture,” he said. Herath said this is a country that sacked a President based on popular opinion two-and-a-half years ago. It was like a referendum and people bear the same opinion to this date, he added. “Politically, there is a distortion related to public opinion in the country at the time. During the Covid-19 threat, we prioritised the lives of people over Elections. But that was a Government that had a public mandate. However, postponing an Election when there is a ‘successor president’ who does not have a mandate is scary,” he said."

In response to the question raised by several Government and Opposition MPs recently with regard to funds received by the JJB for the Election, Handunnetti said politicians of the likes of Johnston Fernando who raise concerns on JJB finances should look into his own finances in the first place. Speaking to the media, he added that the JJB as a responsible party will submit all campaign finance-related documents soon to the public. Handunnetti also said that within a JJB Government, they will be making laws to abolish privileges not only for Presidents, but also to former ministers and formers MPs. He said they will pass a Bill in that regard and added that in a JJB government, as a first step, as soon as it is passed they will implement that new Act and remove  privileges and create public governance accountable to the public. “We believe that people representatives should not get any privileges that are not available to the public. It should be abolished by law. We have already entrusted the responsibility of making the laws to our legal committee”, he said. Speaking further Handunnetti requested the Election Commission to make inquiries from the government printer as to what had actually taken place,  because there must be a hidden hand behind the halting of printing ballot papers in the middle of an Election.  “We ask her not to succumb to pressure of some hidden forces and work for the common people. We request the Election Commission to call her and question her on this. We have checked that none of the other printing works of the printing press have been stopped. Halting printing ballot papers is suspicious,” he said. BY Aloka Kasturiarachchi"

AHP President, Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (14) lamented that even the full blood count (FBC) tests were in jeopardy as a result of the prevailing situation in State hospital labs. Bills of over 12 months are pending while the Health Ministry has been paying them like pouring drops of water onto a heated pan. The five suppliers have been providing the necessary reagents as and when these minute payments are made. He said, of them, four were for European brands. However, the policies of the Health Ministry and some of the specialists would have to be amended if this situation is to change and patients are to at least have their laboratory tests conducted without being inconvenienced. This dependence on using machine specific reagents and purchasing reagents from those who can quote the lowest price must end. “Just because the reagent cost is low it does not mean that the quality is poor as all reagents available in the market have National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) approval,” he pointed out, adding that only after a validation could assumptions be made of the quality. Kumudesh said at present the lab services were forced to experiment and come up with in-house preparations sans the assistance from the Health Ministry. The AHP President said in 2019 the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) expenditure on pharmaceutical purchases had been Rs 36 billion. This was with cancer patients being afforded medicinal drugs to last their lifetime and lenses being given free of cost to cataract patients. In 2022, even without the expenses for the months of November and December the SPC Expenditure shot up to Rs 44 billion.   Kumudesh, lashing out, said the Health Ministry and the Government did not seem to have any plan to resolve the present issue like several other issues which it has allowed to fester.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

AHP President, Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (14) lamented that even the full blood count (FBC) tests were in jeopardy as a result of the prevailing situation in State hospital labs. Bills of over 12 months are pending while the Health Ministry has been paying them like pouring drops of water onto a heated pan. The five suppliers have been providing the necessary reagents as and when these minute payments are made. He said, of them, four were for European brands. However, the policies of the Health Ministry and some of the specialists would have to be amended if this situation is to change and patients are to at least have their laboratory tests conducted without being inconvenienced. This dependence on using machine specific reagents and purchasing reagents from those who can quote the lowest price must end. “Just because the reagent cost is low it does not mean that the quality is poor as all reagents available in the market have National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) approval,” he pointed out, adding that only after a validation could assumptions be made of the quality. Kumudesh said at present the lab services were forced to experiment and come up with in-house preparations sans the assistance from the Health Ministry. The AHP President said in 2019 the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) expenditure on pharmaceutical purchases had been Rs 36 billion. This was with cancer patients being afforded medicinal drugs to last their lifetime and lenses being given free of cost to cataract patients. In 2022, even without the expenses for the months of November and December the SPC Expenditure shot up to Rs 44 billion.   Kumudesh, lashing out, said the Health Ministry and the Government did not seem to have any plan to resolve the present issue like several other issues which it has allowed to fester.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The AHP insisted that the NMRA should put a stop to obstacles in registering pharmaceuticals and suppliers and opt for a more practical method, in a short time, in order to minimise the impact of the current medicinal drug shortage in Sri Lanka. AHP President, Ravi Kumudesh noted that unregistered medicines are entering the market due to a faulty registration system, which does not facilitate the registering of the medicines. He also alleged that this arbitrary conduct of the MRA had paved the way for the Health Minister and various parties to import unregistered drugs at non-competitive prices. “Therefore, the Authority should take responsibility for violating the very purpose for which it was set up,” Kumudesh lashed out.  This situation has placed the State health system under the influence of the medicinal drug mafia. “The State health service is in a state of emergency,” Kumudesh pointed out accusing the NMRA of being unable to recognise it. Instead it has paved the way for a monopoly in the provision of medicines and health supplies. Indian credit support or new suppliers, who are willing to provide pharmaceuticals during the current economic crisis, are discouraged from entering the market by agents of certain pharmaceutical companies, which are hiding behind the NMRA. Instead of motivating new medicinal drug suppliers to readily step in, the NMRA’s main concern is on the pharmaceutical companies in its fancy list,” Kumudesh alleged. He claimed that this had led to the country being unable to import the required pharmaceutical utilising the Indian Credit Line. The AHP President alleged that avoiding, delaying, and seriously hampering the validation process of pharmaceutical supplies arriving from India, was a major cause of the current health crisis. Therefore, the medicinal drug crisis cannot be merely attributed to the economic crisis the island is facing, he added. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

He said former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa opposed the solutions and proposals he forwarded to avoid a fuel shortage by managing the demand and supply of fuel, but in the end, the incumbent Government was compelled to implement the solutions he proposed. Addressing the media yesterday (13) he said fuel queues were eliminated by a solution that he presented. “MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said in Parliament that I was unable to eliminate fuel queues and that Minister Kanchana Wijesekera could. To avoid fuel queues, I proposed the same method the Romans used to eliminate wheat flour queues in the past. Despite the passage of time, there are only two solutions to this problem. That is, managing demand by raising prices or managing supply by rationing, as the Romans did in the past,” he said. Further, Gammanpila said he wrote to the Cabinet on 5 February 2021, stating that a cost-represented price system is required, and that a rationing system should be put in placed on 21 June 2021. He pointed out that raising prices manages demand, while rationing manages supply. “However, Basil, as Finance Minister at the time, opposed both those proposals. Finally, Minister Kanchana will solve this problem by implementing my suggestion. Demand management is achieved by raising the diesel price from Rs 121 to Rs 450. A 20-litre-per-car, 5-litre-per-three-wheelre, and 4-litre-per-motorcycle ration was implemented. Many people refer to it as the QR method. QR is simply a code that allows you to access the database where the ration is stored. Many businesses use QR codes to access their website. The Election Commission made the list of candidates running for office available via QR code. A rationing system was actually implemented. This QR code is required to gain access to the data bank in that ratio,” he said. BY Thameenah Razeek"

Minister of Trade Nalin Fernando met representatives of the ACTCOMA, at the Ministry of Trade, to discuss the quality of coconut oil supplied to the local market. During the meeting, Fernando inquired about the market issues that local coconut oil producers are currently facing. “It is difficult for the traditional small and medium scale local coconut oil producers to compete with those coconut oil products due to low quality imported coconut oil being sold in the market at a low price,” ACTCOMA members claimed. As a precaution to ensure the quality of the coconut oil sold without packaging, Fernando directed Consumer Affairs Authority to take the necessary steps to identify the company that sold the coconut oil. At the moment, the market demand for coconut oil is 18,000 metric tonnes and despite the fact that local coconut oil producers have a capacity of 25,000, they only supply 8,000 metric tonnes to the market due to raw material scarcity. Members of the ACTCOMA said the tax breaks given to coconut oil importers are causing severe difficulties for local coconut oil producers. The Minister said he would take the next step in this regard after consulting with the Ministry of Finance. Furthermore, Ministry officials were directed to take the necessary steps to consult with the Sri Lanka Standards Institute in order to check the quality of coconut oil. The goal of this discussion is to protect consumers while also encouraging local coconut oil producers to provide high-quality products. BY Thameenah Razeek"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He said this culture has roots in Sri Lankan soil and has connections to Tamil Nadu and Kerala cultures as well. He expressed these views at the vesting ceremony of the Jaffna Cultural Centre (JCC) in the people of Sri Lanka and called on everyone to join hands in brotherhood to rebuild this fallen nation. The JCC was completed with funds amounting to Rs 13,500 million provided by the Indian Government and the event was attended by the Union Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Dr. L. Murugan. In his speech, the President emphasised the Government’s policy of reconciliation, development, and culture, and called for all citizens to come together in brotherhood to rebuild the country. “We have decided to celebrate our 75th Independence ceremony not only in Colombo, but also in Jaffna. We will commence the programme here at the JCC, which is a gift from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We are also discussing economic development projects in the Northern Province, a massive development project in the Trincomalee Port, and the energy sector. Furthermore, we appreciate the support extended by the Indian Government to Sri Lanka to overcome the debt trap during this economic crisis,” he said. Minister of Fisheries, Douglas Devananda, said the incumbent President Wickremesinghe has visited Jaffna twice in less than two months and has a good understanding of the problems faced by the people in the North. He has also outlined steps to be taken to solve these problems and has announced the implementation of the 13th Amendment. The President is seen as a solution to the economic crisis of 2022, and therefore, everyone should support him. The people of the North prefer to live as Sri Lankan Tamils. Indian State Minister L. Murugan expressed delight in being present at the inauguration of the cultural centre in Jaffna. The foundation stone for this centre was laid during the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March 2015, and its construction has now been completed. This cultural centre will play a significant role in promoting cultural and artistic activities in Jaffna. “During my recent visits to several provinces of Sri Lanka, I witnessed the support that India has given for the development of housing as well as infrastructure, education, health, and agriculture sectors. Among them are the Duraiappa Stadium and Thirukedeeswaram Kovil. In addition, when Sri Lanka faced a severe economic crisis in 2022, India provided USD 4 million in assistance. In addition, India provided the necessary financial guarantee for the restructuring of Sri Lanka’s debt to receive financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund. It should be noted here that Prime Minister Modi has an idaea to introduce a scholarship for 100 children from low-income families in the Northern Province, extending India’s assistance to Sri Lanka. India will be celebrating 100 years of Independence in 2047. India has already planned and implemented measures in this regard. I believe Sri Lanka has done the same.

However, the final conditional approval has been issued by the Department of Forest Conservation and the approval highlights the fact that the said location is adjacent to a Reserve Forest. The CEJ emphasised that 150- 200 elephants cross this elephant corridor daily, yet the the Department of Wildlife Conservation has given a letter stating the land does not come under its purview, while, the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Conservation is unaware about the said event. “Considering the fact that the area  is an active elephant habitat, the Forest Department has requested the organisers to maintain low noise levels. The Department has also warned about elephant movements on the bund of the Karandagaswewa reservoir and advised against staying on the bund of the tank specially during the night-time,” they said. They further observed that the Police circular No. 2031/2007, issued by the Inspector General of Police, fully prohibits the use of sound producing equipment from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.  “As we know, the animal kingdom responds to noise very differently. Hearing ranges from very high frequency ultrasound (>20,000 Hz) echolocation in bats to very low frequency infrasound (<20 Hz) in elephants. In addition to that the forest is considered as a silent zone as any noise can disturb the wild animals,” they observed. The CEJ went onto to state, “we believe the proposed activities during the music festival such as electronic music and busy human gathering will exceed the noise level way above the permissible levels and the agencies which granted permission are not in a position to neutralise the discomfort on wild animals including elephants. Bright lighting will be harmful to wild animals including elephants. This area is known for elephant train accidents. There is a possibility of disturbed elephants being hit by trains or entering into the residential areas and damaging the properties of the local people.” They thereby demanded the relevant authorities to immediately cancel the approvals given and for the organisers to shift the event to another location. “We also demand the Inspector General of Police, Conservator General of Forest and Director General of Wildlife to adhere to the Police circular 2031/2007 and to the provisions of the Environment impact assessment, when conducting any project in the buffer zone of any Forest reserve and of any National reserve . Any failure to monitor and maintain the law of this country will be strictly dealt and legal action will be taken against those who are responsible for such violations and failures,” they said. "

The first shipments are due to go out today on EK 121 and EK 117, consisting of high thermal blankets and family tents from UNHCR, followed by World Health Organisation (WHO) and World Food Programme (WFP) relief cargo of medical kits and shelter items, co-ordinated by the IHC in Dubai.  In the coming days, more consignments of blankets, tents, shelter kits, flash lights, water distribution ramps and trauma and emergency health kits will be transported on Emirates. Emirates SkyCargo plans to dedicate cargo space for around 100 tonnes of humanitarian relief goods over the course of the next two weeks across its daily flight operations to Istanbul. The critical emergency supplies carried on Emirates will then be delivered by local organisations to affected areas in southern Turkey and northern Syria, supporting on-ground responders and providing much needed aid to the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the earthquakes.  HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Emirates’ Chairman and Chief Executive, said: “We stand with the Turkish and Syrian people and are working with experts like the International Humanitarian City to help provide urgent relief to those affected and displaced by the earthquakes, as well as support the complex recovery efforts on the ground. Emirates has extensive experience in supporting humanitarian relief efforts, and through its three daily flights to Istanbul will offer regular and consistent widebody capacity for relief items and medical supplies. Emirates also supports the UAE’s ongoing humanitarian efforts to support Turkey and Syria, and Dubai’s unique position as the world’s largest international aid logistics hub means that we can efficiently reach disaster stricken areas and the most vulnerable people as quickly as possible.” His Excellency Mohammed Ibrahim Al Shaibani, Chairman of the Supreme Committee for the Supervision of IHC: “The IHC remains committed to providing the people affected by the earthquakes with the humanitarian support and resources they need. We are taking urgent action by facilitating airlifts of vital medical supplies, shelter items and other relief goods from the UNHCR, World Health Organization (WHO) and World Food Programme (WFP) to address the pressing demand for aid in the affected regions.” The freight division of Emirates has a long-standing partnership with the IHC, enabling the airline to nimbly and quickly lead on numerous relief missions, deploying humanitarian supplies to communities around the world impacted by natural disasters, medical emergencies, global outbreaks and other crises. In 2020, the airline facilitated relief efforts to Lebanon in the aftermath of the Port of Beirut blasts. In 2021, Emirates set up a humanitarian airbridge between Dubai and India to transport urgent medical and relief items to support the country in containing the Covid-19 outbreak. Last year, the airline offered cargo capacity to organisations working with the IHC to transport critical equipment and supplies directly to five cities in Pakistan devastated by flooding.   Over the years, Emirates has also supported humanitarian flights in partnership with the Airbus Foundation, and since 2013, Emirates A380 ferry flights have transported over 120 tonnes of food and vital emergency equipment to those in need."

The funding is being used to provide much-needed cash and other assistance to improve food security among rural farming communities affected by the country’s economic crisis. Through this funding, over 1,000 smallholder farmers across five drought-prone districts are being provided with LKR 50,000 each (approximately US$140) to access essential items, including food. The funding will also support recovery among communities grappling with the twin challenges of the economic and climate crises. Through a suite of assistance, which includes diversified sources of income and enhanced access to markets, WFP aims to improve the livelihoods of those most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. “Switzerland is supporting Sri Lanka in many ways during this difficult time. Farmers, their families and many people associated with the agricultural sector are currently facing enormous difficulties. I am grateful that we have developed a partnership with WFP to strengthen the resilience of Sri Lankan farmers. This will ultimately benefit the entire population,” said Ambassador of Switzerland to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Dr. Dominik Furgler. “Smallholder farmers form the backbone of our food systems but are among those hardest hit by the economic crisis,” said Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, Representative and Country Director of WFP Sri Lanka. “Their capacity to cope has been stretched to the limit, severely undermining their ability to withstand any future disasters such as floods and drought. This funding from Switzerland is timely and critical to assist these communities in meeting their immediate food needs while helping to restore food security in the long term.” Sri Lanka was ranked second among countries most affected by extreme weather events in the last 20 years, as per the Global Climate Risk Index 2019. As part of its efforts to strengthen food security, WFP works towards making food systems more robust and resilient to the effects of the climate crisis.

He was speaking at the awarding of prizes and certificates at the ICT competition, which was held for the second time in Colombo. “Also, since the future of the youth rests with the improvement of technology, opportunities for students to enter university should be systematically increased. Science and technology courses should be expanded in higher education and schools in rural areas should be provided with enough science and mathematics teachers to provide opportunities for this. The concept of school clusters will be based on  good resource management,” he said. Further, he said peer countries are now about ten years ahead of us in technology, and we cannot return to the twentieth century from the third decade of the twenty-first century, so we must move towards a mandatory education transformation process in the next five years.

However, Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera said despite the letter, no action has been taken by Finance Ministry officials and that he will notify the President about this at today’s (13) Cabinet meeting. He said the Ministry of Agriculture has begun a programme to discourage importing potatoes during the local potato harvest to protect local potato farmers and local potato cultivation. “Every time the local potato harvest was in operation, farmers were forced to abandon local potato cultivation due to potato imports by every Government. It is the Government’s responsibility to protect farmers who grow potatoes in this country by investing large sums of money, and thus, despite sending this letter, officials from the Finance Ministry have taken no action,” he said. He was attending an event organised by the Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project, which began the harvesting of seed potatoes in the Boralanda area of Welimada on 11 February. He also said this step was taken to increase the production of seed potatoes needed to increase potato cultivation in Sri Lanka. “Under the Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project, the production of seed potatoes in Sri Lanka has been increased to nine million. Now about one hundred acres of seed potatoes were being cultivated in the Boralanda area. He advised that more land should come under potato cultivation,” he said.

Speaking to the media  from the Opposition Leader’s office in Colombo, he further said for the past 40 years the masses had been looking up to individuals to solve theirs and the country’s problems, but history has shown that these expectations have been brought to nought. He also said though many countries have managed the current economic crisis which is global in nature, the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) however has not been able to manage it because it does not have a proper management or action plan other than siphoning off public resources. “GoSL for over five months have been harping on a USD 2.9 billion IMF loan to tide over this crisis, but this loan is yet to see fruition. The country will never move forward without having proper international relations. He therefore urged the people to hand over power of the country or village to a party that has a team with experience that can deal with the international community,” Wickramaratne said. Speaking further, he said, Elections must be held from time to time and this time around it cannot be said that the people did not demand it, since it is stated in the Constitution or other laws to hold such periodic polls, it is anti-democratic to prevent Elections by giving lame excuses. The SJB MP also said the democratic framework of a country should be strengthened. He warned that if it is attacked, the people will take the law into their own hands. “It was reported that a Jaffna MP who held protests when the President visited Jaffna on 11 February was bailed out yesterday. These are unnecessary harassments against the people caused by the Police deprive the people of their democratic rights,” Wickramaratne said. The SJB MP said, “Left parties in the country have been disrupting education opportunities for decades. If you try to start a private university, it will be jeopardised at any cost by them.  GoSL does not have enough resources to grant higher education for all. So getting the assistance of the private sector to provide higher education was inevitable.” Wickramaratne added, a country’s problems are complex in nature. Therefore a team with experience and expertise is needed to solve such problems. Not only in the country’s governance or politics, but also in business, different experts are needed for different sectors. Can an uneducated person become a school teacher? Educated experts were needed in all fields to solve the country’s complex problems. Such experts are found only in the SJB, he said. (PA)"

The President also inquired about the problems related to paddy cultivation from farmers of the Paranthan area and assured that immediate solutions will be provided to those problems. The President said the Government promptly provided required fertiliser to farmers. Therefore, we believe that there will be a surplus of paddy in the Maha Season. Accordingly, arrangements are being made for the Government to purchase a kilo of paddy at a guaranteed price of Rs 100. “Many people are currently experiencing financial difficulties. Even if yields increase, there is a segment of the population that lacks the financial means to purchase rice. Therefore, we are implementing a programme to provide 10 kilos of rice free of charge to 2 million families during March and April. Then by the Sinhala New Year season, they would have received 20 kilogramme of rice. Currently, approximately three metric tonnes of paddy is received per hectare. We require a minimum of 6 metric tons of rice per hectare. If possible, we hope to increase it to seven metric tonne,” he said. Speaking further he said the Government is working to provide the necessary facilities to achieve that target. More methods of purchasing and storing paddy will be developed in the future. We intend to build small and medium-sized rice mills. “We will be able to succeed in those activities in the next two years. We have planned to provide the necessary water facilities for this area. We are working to restore the Pooneryn tank. Meanwhile, the Iranamadu tank was now ready. We are working to transform the Jaffna district and the Northern Province into a province that is capable of producing enough food to feed the country once more.

Addressing an election rally in Kegalle, Fernando said that some seemed to have been impressed by the massive numbers of participants at JVP rallies. He said, the JVP has 70,000 members who are taken from one rally to another so that they could show the numbers to impress others. “It is not a new phenomenon. They had been doing so for years. But when it comes to the final count of votes only their trick is exposed. Even if they win or lose they have a mechanism to bring people to their rallies. The JVP has created a Facebook wave to show that they are going to win the forthcoming local polls. Even in the last elections the JVP could only poll 42,000 votes. Suppose they would get their maximum this time, even then they would get only 120,000 to 130,000 votes from all over the country. With that they would not be able to get power,” he said. Speaking further Fernando noted that even if they win the election they cannot govern a country because they do not know how to do that and they do not have the capacity to do that. He said, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake would not be able to work with the international community to get the necessary assistance to steer the country out of the present crisis. “He would not be able to secure the support of the international community to bring fuel. He does not have international connections. Basil Rajapaksa got 4.5 billion US dollars from India. Using that money we imported fuel. Anura cannot do that. He cannot even speak to Indian fishermen to get at least a litre of petrol from them. We challenge the JVP to name who would be the ministers of finance and foreign affairs under a government of theirs. They do not have persons with capacity to hold such positions. The JVP has always been duping the people. During the time of Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1971 they got around 12,000 youth killed and in the 1987-88 period another 60,000 youth. Those who were born after 2000 do not know the real conduct of the JVP,” he said."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/02/13/international-day-of-women-and-girls-in-science/,International Day of Women and Girls in Science,Author not found,0,2023-02-12T20:30:00+00:00,"Science Needs Women So Let Her STEM Did you know that globally women amount to only about a quarter of the workforce in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), and that men vastly outnumber women majoring in most STEM fields in universities? The gender gaps are particularly high in some of the fastest-growing and highest-paid jobs such as IT and engineering. How serious is the underrepresentation of women in STEM in Sri Lanka? According to the University Grants Commission (UGC), in 2017, women accounted for nearly half – 49 percent – of undergraduate enrolments in STEM subjects in local universities. And yet, when examining the workforce, there are far fewer women working and leading in STEM. There is also a significant gendered divide within different STEM sectors, with much lower representation of women in fields like math, engineering and technology which are seen as ‘masculine’ or ‘male oriented’ fields, while more women in STEM pursue care-oriented fields such as health and biological sciences. Why are there fewer women in STEM fields? The underrepresentation of women in STEM is shaped by harmful gender stereotypes, norms and roles. These range from the idea that investment in women’s education is less important since women are primarily caregivers while men are breadwinners, to the belief that certain STEM fields are naturally more suited to the ‘male/ masculine’ mind and that women cannot equally understand or thrive in them. These biases and norms affect men and women in these sectors. Women often choose their fields of education and work based on how they perceive their abilities and roles in society. Men – particularly male family members, educators, and employers – allow these norms to guide their support, teaching, and recruitment.  These are major challenges to women’s equal entry into and engagement in STEM careers. In Sri Lanka, the multilayered crisis threatens to widen the gender gap in STEM fields. Building off of harmful gender norms and biases, economic hardship has affected girls’ access to education, with families choosing to educate their sons instead of daughters to cope with rising costs and poverty. Why do we need more women in STEM? As Sri Lanka navigates this economic crisis, addressing the gender gap in STEM fields is more crucial than ever. With an increasing number of jobs being digitalized, it is essential that women are not left behind in this transition and contribute to the development of a more equal and sustainable future economy. Women in Sri Lanka’s workforce predominantly belong to the low-skilled and informal workforce, and continue to be a minority in sectors like the tech industry, for example, which is one of the fastest-growing and highest-paying sectors worldwide. Closing the gender gap in STEM will ensure that women have access to more high-skilled employment and are meaningfully included in the economic growth that is driven by technology and innovation. At the same time, as these fields evolve and expand, it is increasingly imperative that the capabilities and perspectives of women are brought in to bring about innovative, inclusive and effective solutions to the complex societal challenges of today and to strengthen our collective performance on economic and development indicators. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, it was largely women in medical research who led the development of vaccines while also studying gendered impacts of COVID-19 on women’s bodies – a nuance which is too often excluded from scientific study. In a time of growing online violence, women in tech are leading the advocacy and work on developing safeguards and accountability systems to protect female users. As work on artificial intelligence (AI) expands, the technical contribution and oversight of women is vital to combat gender biases in AI algorithms. We cannot have products and innovation which include and reach out to all communities, genders, and consumer groups, unless they are equally driven by women. What are the necessary steps to close the gender gap in STEM in Sri Lanka? Closing the gender gap in STEM in Sri Lanka will require targeted and continued efforts in society, institutions, and the operational frameworks of STEM fields. As global societies, we must deconstruct harmful gender stereotypes and biases on the roles of women in society and their capacity to thrive in and expand STEM fields. But what does that mean? It means holistic efforts to recognize our own individual assumptions and biases about each gender,  and to address them in our daily life. It means reforming our educational structures and approaches. Our schools and universities must allow and encourage students to explore their interests regardless of their gender, and expand from current approaches to  – for example – encourage boys to explore domestic skills and the arts, and girls to explore mechanics and high-intensity sport. Our educational structures must celebrate those who have crossed gender lines, and pave the path for innovators, scientists, and artistes alike. Curricula across all levels of education must build an understanding of social issues along with critical thinking skills to recognize and deconstruct biases and discrimination. Academics must increasingly examine issues of science, technology, engineering and math through the lens of gender, in line with growing research that makes vital discoveries when adopting sex and gender disaggregated analysis. It means reforming the approach of media and the arts to present a broader view of individual capabilities, character, and potential, and counter discriminatory and misogynistic views, rather than reinforcing restrictive and biased gender norms.  It means breaking the barriers that keep and push women out of the STEM workforce and making tangible reforms towards more inclusive workplaces that allow women to thrive and lead in STEM. If the gender gap in STEM fields is to be sustainably redressed, our efforts must go beyond performative policies and translate into structural and equitable change including equal pay for equal work, equal paid family leave, childcare facilities and flexible work arrangements. These shifts in companies’ operating ethos have a tangible impact on closing gender gaps and retaining talent and skilled labour – a fact which has been established by multiple global and regional studies. The necessity of attracting and retaining women in STEM is increasingly recognized by leading actors in these fields. Giants in the technology sector including Google and Microsoft have programmes targeting the recruitment and upskilling of women in tech.  In some instances, international corporates, tech hubs, and governments have created collectives for more diverse and inclusive landscapes in technology. The future of STEM must belong to all of us. By closing the gender gap in STEM fields, we not only empower women and girls, but we also unleash a wealth of creativity and innovation as well as necessary inclusion and progress for society as a whole. It’s time to take action and break down the barriers that limit women’s contributions in STEM fields. On this year’s International Day of Women and Girls in Science let’s work together, challenge biases, and pave the way for a brighter and more equal future in the fields of science and innovation – for all."

He added that two companies that have installed these types of faulty air bags have already recalled their vehicles and begun the air bag replacement process. When queried how many vehicles with faulty air bags have been identified, Weerasingha responded that they will compile figures this week. “With the fatal car accident, it was revealed that a piece of iron in the air bag hit his neck. In this connection, we found the categories of vehicles equipped with such air bags,” he said. A scientist from the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) was killed in a road accident in Kumbuka, Gonapola on 3 February. Police said the 37-year-old scientist, who was returning home in a luxury car, died after his vehicle collided with a concrete post of an unsecured roadblock. His car had toppled and he was killed when a metal shard of the air bag that activated on impact caused grievous injuries. Following this tragedy, local dealers of vehicles similar to that of the late scientist have recalled certain vehicle models for an air bag system upgrade. By Thameenah Razeek"

Accordingly, the Additional Magistrate stated that as per information conveyed to her by investigating officers that their probe into the death of the deceased has not been concluded as yet, she would be deferring her verdict on the Magisterial Inquest. As such, she mentioned that her decision on it will be delivered once the investigators submit all their reports to Court. Counsel Premaratne stated that as per the initial post-mortem report, it had been stipulated that the victim had died after being strangled. He said, however, the second report had said the deceased had died after being strangulated, as well as due to ingestion of cyanide in his system. He opined that the JMO report, which had been submitted to Court by the CID, had been sought from an individual, who had been suspended from practice for a period of eight months, by the Medical Council and hence it was contradictory. The PC told the Court that the initial post-mortem, conducted into the death of Dinesh Schaffter, had shown that there had been a few scratches on his face, while there had also been reddish marks on his neck, while similar marks had also been spotted on his fingers. Anuja Premaratne explained that thepost-mortem report, compiled on 16 December, had mentioned that the victim had died after being bound with zip ties and a wire around his neck. But, he pointed out that the subsequent post mortem report, conducted into the death of the deceased, had maintained that the latter, had died due to strangulation and ingestion of cyanide. He informed the Court, that though the post mortem report had mentioned that 150 ml of cyanide had been in the victim’s body, if such an amount had been ingested in a human, then that person’s body would invariably become pale, as per accepted medical science methods. Therefore, counsel argued that though the JMO had stated that the upper part of the victim’s body had blackened upon his death, the report compiled by the GA had observed that the amount of cyanide contained in the blood of the deceased, had been less than what had been mentioned in the JMO report and hence it is contradictory. Afterwards, Premaratne urged the Court, to defer its decision on the Magisterial Inquest into the death of Dinesh Schaffter, due primarily to the contradictory nature of the post-mortem reports that has been compiled and submitted to Court. The CID told Additional Magistrate Jayasuriya, that already 14 investigative teams had been deployed, to probe the death of the Janashakthi Insurance PLC Director and that they had already recorded statements from 20 individuals in this regard. They added that they had also inquired into 26 CCTV camera footages that had been installed, on the route that had been used by the deceased, for his final journey to the Cemetery. The CID stressed that from investigations carried out thus far, it had come to light that the deceased businessman, had been engaged in financial transactions with four other individuals, namely Brian Thomas, Elian Gunawardena, S. Uganathan and Deepthi Perera. They noted that investigations conducted had revealed that during such transactions, the victim had suffered massive financial losses and that most such losses had been incurred at the hands of Brian Thomas. The CID testifying further insisted that on the day of the death of the businessman, which was 15 December last year, perusal of telecommunication towers and analysis of mobile phone data, had revealed that Schaffter, had not been in conversation with any of the four aforementioned individuals or with any other person. They explained that data gathered from such smart phone systems, such as WhatsApp, IMO and VIBER had also been thoroughly analysed by them. Following the CID concluding testifying, the Additional Magistrate informed Court, that her final decision on the Magisterial Inquest into Schaffter’s death will be deferred to a later date, as the prosecution has still not concluded its probe into the case. She then instructed the CID, to expedite its probe into the case and submit all investigative reports to Court promptly. She fixed further hearing of testifying into the case to 8 March.    By Hansi Nanayakkara"

Speaking in Parliament, Wijesekara noted that the electricity tariff charged from apartment complexes are 50 per cent lesser than the tariffs charged from normal domestic housing units. He raised concerns as to why the PUCSL has allowed such special relief for apartment complexes. Speaking further, the Minister said he hopes that PUCSL would, as promised, give its approval for the proposed electricity tariff revision on 15 February. “The PUCSL promised the Cabinet and the National Council that it will amend the tariff proposals and give its approval on 15 February.

As mentioned in the MoU, India will continue to provide maintenance support to the (JCC) for duration of five years, the Indian Government said. The Fisheries Ministry has also planned to host a National Independence Day celebration on 11 February at the JCC.  In March 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the groundwork for the Jaffna Cultural Centre. During his visit, Murugan will visit several locations that demonstrate the scope and breadth of the Indian Government’s people-centred development partnership in Sri Lanka. He will also meet leaders and stakeholders, according to a news statement from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The JCC will be the symbol of improved relations between India and Sri Lanka, said the Indian Government. The JCC houses a museum, an auditorium with 11 floors and a modern theatre with a seating capacity for up to 600 people. A progress meeting regarding the President’s visit to Jaffna was held yesterday (9), at the Jaffna District Secretariat under the leadership of the Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda.

The JCC was not formally unveiled for over two years because there was a “conflict” on whether the Jaffna Municipal Council or the Central Government would run it. According to the Jaffna Municipal Council, the MoU said that the JCC should be operated by them and they have adequate funds to do so, however, the Sri Lankan Government stated that the Jaffna MC has no money and that the government will operate it.

Later the CID submitted a progress report on the case to the Chief Magistrate. Last month, the CID was ordered to obtain a report from the British High Commission in Colombo, on Gamage’s citizenship, and to conduct further investigations in this connection.  The relevant report was submitted to Court yesterday. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner Oshala Herath, President’s Counsel Rienzie Arsecularatne stressed that in the event an average person of a non-political background committed such an offence, prompt legal action would have been instituted against the said individual. However, no such haste is being seen in this case, owing to the fact that it concerns a State Minister. Accordingly, the next hearing of the case was fixed for 2 March, by the Court. The CID had informed the Court that they had noticed that Provisions contained in Section 175 of the Penal Code as well as the Section 45 (1) of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act No.20 of 1948 had been violated.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/02/09/ndcu-mulls-reinforcing-mosquito-control-act/,NDCU mulls reinforcing Mosquito Control Act,Author not found,0,2023-02-08T20:50:00+00:00," With Dengue cases shooting up to nearly 11,000 by the fifth week of this year, the National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) said it is looking at the possibility of amending the mosquito control laws to strengthen them further. Consultant Community Physician of NDCU,Dr. Anoja Dheerasinghe, when contacted, said the Unit was looking at amending the Mosquito Control Act No. 11 of 2007. “At present, legal action can be instituted against those who fail to follow the instructions given by Dengue control teams that visit premises for inspection. This is in regard to ridding their premises of mosquito breeding grounds. The Court can impose a fine on them.” She said there have been suggestions with regard to fines and amounts etc. but all this takes time and needs to go through the Legal Draftsman and receive Cabinet approval. Fielding questions, she said monsoonal rains impacted the Dengue caseload. From 1 January to 8 February there were 10,958 Dengue cases. Last month, there were 8,963 cases recorded while from 1 February till date there have been 1,995 Dengue cases diagnosed in the country. She said, however, that the Act cannot be used to impose spot fines on the public. But it was best for every individual to rid their surroundings of mosquito breeding places. She stressed on the need for anyone who develops a fever which lasts for over 24 hours to seek medical attention while pregnant women should seek immediate medical attention in case they develop a fever. Dr. Dheerasinghe advised the public to take only paracetamol to get the fever down. Ceylon Today learns that under the Western Province Declaration, the Ministry of Health had also instructed its Public Health Officers on imposing spot fines on individuals who fail to rid their premises of mosquito breeding sites. The declaration also allows legal action to be taken against such persons. Section 262 of the Penal Code also permitted spot fines to be imposed on such persons. Meanwhile, National Convener, Health Entomology Officers’ Association (HEOA), Disnaka Dissanayake said, however, that increasing fines will only burden the public further during the economic crisis. “Instead, policy should be formulated by a committee comprising all stakeholders engaged in Dengue control. The Medical Officer to the Public Health Inspector and the Health Entomology Officer should be included in that committee so as to form a proper long-term policy against Dengue. Further, the public should be made aware – they should be educated on the disease itself and the vector and its habits. There are people who still think that the Aedes aegypti mosquito breeds in water that flows in drains and unclean pools. On the contrary, they should be made aware that Dengue mosquitoes breed in clean water,” he said. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

In a statement, the PMD said, false reports are being circulated about the cost of Independence Day celebrations this year and it is clearly another extension of the narrow political agenda that forced people to boycott the official State celebration of Independence due to the economic crisis. These forces even attempted to convince the people that even providing mobile toilet facilities during the Independence Day celebration was a mistake, the PMD said. “However, it should be emphasised that high-ranking foreign diplomats were invited to this celebration including Japanese State Minister for Foreign Affairs Takei Shunsuke, Bhutan’s Minister for Education and Skills Development Jai Bir Rai, Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Dr. A.K. Abdul Momen, Pakistan’s Minister of State for External Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar, Indian Minister of State for External Affairs V.

Further, around 3,200 dignitaries including ambassadors, high commissioners of foreign countries, as well as 6,670 armed forces personnel and the Police attended the ceremony. Also, these mobile toilet facilities were provided for the personnel engaged in rehearsals for the Independence celebration. In such a background, as a measure to provide proper health and safety measures for an event where thousands of people gather, it cannot be determined as an unnecessary expense for the provision of adequate mobile toilet facilities. It should also be noted that not paying adequate attention to such an essential aspect at an official state event where a large number of people gather, is a disgrace to the country.” The PMD further said the Education Ministry did not spend funds for the Independence Day celebrations."

However, essential medical services, such as Emergency Departments, Renal Hospitals and Units, and Children’s Hospitals and Units will continue uninterrupted. This action is taken to support the massive rally organised by over 40 trade unions against new tax scheme on the same day. Professional health services trade unions including Ayurvedic doctors and the Medical Faculty Teachers’ Union, will join engineers of the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Water Board, banking sector grade officers, Inland Revenue, Ports Authority, Government Joint Executives, and Airport Executives to stage a public rally. Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Thanigaivasan Ratnasingam, said over 40 professionals’ trade unions including the above mentioned will gather at Hyde Park at 2:00 p.m. today (8) for a  rally against the new Inland Revenue Tax Act.   Dr. Ratnasingam said doctors in his outfit would carry out a token strike in State hospitals and the private sector against the Government’s oppressive tax policy. Only emergencies will be attended to during the strike while routine services will not be carried out for the day, he said. However, the union will exempt children’s hospitals and wards, women’s hospitals, Cancer Hospital and Unit, Tri-Forces hospitals, Renal Hospitals and Units. Dr. Ratnasingam said his outfit had met Central Committee Members and discussed at length the shortage of pharmaceuticals and the escalation of their prices, the Government’s rigidity and insensitivity towards proposals made by professional groups for the implementation of  a fair and transparent tax system, the damage caused to the country by the increasing brain drain as a result of the unfair tax system, the Government’s double standards in demanding sacrifices from the professionals and the public affected by the economic crisis while spending abundantly on the destructive and harmful matters such as the former President, Cabinet and Parliament as well as on the Independence Day ceremony. Expressing the dissatisfaction of union members, the GMOA Media Committee Member accused the Government of failing to prepare a recovery plan for the billions the country had lost through the large-scale fraud and corruption committed by government cronies. “It has failed to prepare a transparent programme to assess how that money was being utilised towards public betterment,” he said. Meanwhile the Government Dental Surgeons’ Association (GDSA) said it had been attempting to warn the Government of the detrimental and counterproductive impact the present new direct tax policy had on the country. “Even though we recognise the importance of taxes as a major source of income for the Government of Sri Lanka, as well as our need to pay reasonable and acceptable taxes in the form of direct and indirect taxes, the recent sudden dramatic increase in direct personal tax during the worst economic recession in Sri Lanka’s history is tangible on our members and all professionals,” GDSA General Secretary, Manjula Herath lamented.  “With the Government not responding favourably towards the GDSA’s demand, all grade dental surgeons will enter into a one-day token strike today (8) countrywide to force the Government to find an acceptable solution to this issue. All government dental surgeons will refrain from engaging in regular services and private channelling during this period,” he warned.  Dr. Herath said all emergency services will be maintained throughout the strike, while dental surgeons working in all maternity hospitals, children’s hospitals, and cancer hospitals will not participate in the strike.

The latest programme to attract new shipping lines to the POC has been planned and implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Ports and Shipping, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT), South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT), Ceylon Association of Shipping Agents (CASA) and Sri Lanka Association of Vessel Owners (SLAVO) to effectively address strategic business promotions as a fruitful means to overcome the prevailing economic crisis. Attracting more new lines to the POC, increasing operational efficiency, expediting naval services, efficiency in logistics and warehouse management and container and cargo transportation are among the objectives. MSC America will be operated as a weekly caller to Colombo. On the first call, the vessel carried 2,300 TEUs to Colombo and is expected to carry 2,500 TEUs on a weekly basis. The vessel with a length of 334 m and a 7.5 m draft sails under the flag of Panama. The port rotation includes Singapore and South Africa. MSC is the largest global shipping line with a fleet of more than 775 TEU vessels for container transportation around the world. The shipping line that maintains long-term operations with the POC has a collaborative business relationship of more than 10 years with SLPA. Since 2015, it is the prime shipping line of the POC with an annual operational capacity of 2 million TEUs. It performs about 900 calls per annum at the POC. The deep draft vessels owned by MSC call at the CICT of the POC, whilst also calling at the SLPA-controlled JCT and ECT with more than 1 million TEUs per annum, becoming the main customer of the SLPA. According to MSC Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, the local agents for MSC shipping lines, another three new shipping lines under INGWE West Bound service, East Africa Express service and East Med Service will call at the POC this month. To mark MSC America’s first call at the POC, a special plaque exchange was held at the ECT of the SLPA between Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva and the Master of the vessel, Capt. Matlin Alexander. SLPA Chairman, Keith D. Bernard and several representatives of MSC Lanka (Pvt) Ltd also attended the occasion. Speaking at the occasion, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said, “With the deep draft of the East Container Terminal, there is ample potential for mega vessels to call at the port. The remaining development process of the terminal is expedited with an investment of Rs 5.9 billion. Today, a mega vessel of the MSC has contributed for container operations via the Port of Colombo. Similarly, four new services will be added to increase the capacity of the POC. That will increase our revenue. This has further strengthened the trust placed by the international shipping community in the Port of Colombo.”"

According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

In a statement, the PMD said, false reports are being circulated about the cost of Independence Day celebrations this year and it is clearly another extension of the narrow political agenda that forced people to boycott the official State celebration of Independence due to the economic crisis. These forces even attempted to convince the people that even providing mobile toilet facilities during the Independence Day celebration was a mistake, the PMD said. “However, it should be emphasised that high-ranking foreign diplomats were invited to this celebration including Japanese State Minister for Foreign Affairs Takei Shunsuke, Bhutan’s Minister for Education and Skills Development Jai Bir Rai, Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Dr. A.K. Abdul Momen, Pakistan’s Minister of State for External Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar, Indian Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, Nepali Foreign Minister Dr. Bimala Rai Paudyal and Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland. Further, around 3,200 dignitaries including ambassadors, high commissioners of foreign countries, as well as 6,670 armed forces personnel and the Police attended the ceremony. Also, these mobile toilet facilities were provided for the personnel engaged in rehearsals for the Independence celebration. In such a background, as a measure to provide proper health and safety measures for an event where thousands of people gather, it cannot be determined as an unnecessary expense for the provision of adequate mobile toilet facilities. It should also be noted that not paying adequate attention to such an essential aspect at an official state event where a large number of people gather, is a disgrace to the country.” The PMD further said the Education Ministry did not spend funds for the Independence Day celebrations."

However, essential medical services, such as Emergency Departments, Renal Hospitals and Units, and Children’s Hospitals and Units will continue uninterrupted. This action is taken to support the massive rally organised by over 40 trade unions against new tax scheme on the same day. Professional health services trade unions including Ayurvedic doctors and the Medical Faculty Teachers’ Union, will join engineers of the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Water Board, banking sector grade officers, Inland Revenue, Ports Authority, Government Joint Executives, and Airport Executives to stage a public rally. Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Thanigaivasan Ratnasingam, said over 40 professionals’ trade unions including the above mentioned will gather at Hyde Park at 2:00 p.m. today (8) for a  rally against the new Inland Revenue Tax Act.   Dr. Ratnasingam said doctors in his outfit would carry out a token strike in State hospitals and the private sector against the Government’s oppressive tax policy. Only emergencies will be attended to during the strike while routine services will not be carried out for the day, he said. However, the union will exempt children’s hospitals and wards, women’s hospitals, Cancer Hospital and Unit, Tri-Forces hospitals, Renal Hospitals and Units. Dr. Ratnasingam said his outfit had met Central Committee Members and discussed at length the shortage of pharmaceuticals and the escalation of their prices, the Government’s rigidity and insensitivity towards proposals made by professional groups for the implementation of  a fair and transparent tax system, the damage caused to the country by the increasing brain drain as a result of the unfair tax system, the Government’s double standards in demanding sacrifices from the professionals and the public affected by the economic crisis while spending abundantly on the destructive and harmful matters such as the former President, Cabinet and Parliament as well as on the Independence Day ceremony. Expressing the dissatisfaction of union members, the GMOA Media Committee Member accused the Government of failing to prepare a recovery plan for the billions the country had lost through the large-scale fraud and corruption committed by government cronies. “It has failed to prepare a transparent programme to assess how that money was being utilised towards public betterment,” he said. Meanwhile the Government Dental Surgeons’ Association (GDSA) said it had been attempting to warn the Government of the detrimental and counterproductive impact the present new direct tax policy had on the country. “Even though we recognise the importance of taxes as a major source of income for the Government of Sri Lanka, as well as our need to pay reasonable and acceptable taxes in the form of direct and indirect taxes, the recent sudden dramatic increase in direct personal tax during the worst economic recession in Sri Lanka’s history is tangible on our members and all professionals,” GDSA General Secretary, Manjula Herath lamented.  “With the Government not responding favourably towards the GDSA’s demand, all grade dental surgeons will enter into a one-day token strike today (8) countrywide to force the Government to find an acceptable solution to this issue. All government dental surgeons will refrain from engaging in regular services and private channelling during this period,” he warned.  Dr. Herath said all emergency services will be maintained throughout the strike, while dental surgeons working in all maternity hospitals, children’s hospitals, and cancer hospitals will not participate in the strike.

The latest programme to attract new shipping lines to the POC has been planned and implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Ports and Shipping, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT), South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT), Ceylon Association of Shipping Agents (CASA) and Sri Lanka Association of Vessel Owners (SLAVO) to effectively address strategic business promotions as a fruitful means to overcome the prevailing economic crisis. Attracting more new lines to the POC, increasing operational efficiency, expediting naval services, efficiency in logistics and warehouse management and container and cargo transportation are among the objectives. MSC America will be operated as a weekly caller to Colombo. On the first call, the vessel carried 2,300 TEUs to Colombo and is expected to carry 2,500 TEUs on a weekly basis. The vessel with a length of 334 m and a 7.5 m draft sails under the flag of Panama. The port rotation includes Singapore and South Africa. MSC is the largest global shipping line with a fleet of more than 775 TEU vessels for container transportation around the world. The shipping line that maintains long-term operations with the POC has a collaborative business relationship of more than 10 years with SLPA. Since 2015, it is the prime shipping line of the POC with an annual operational capacity of 2 million TEUs. It performs about 900 calls per annum at the POC. The deep draft vessels owned by MSC call at the CICT of the POC, whilst also calling at the SLPA-controlled JCT and ECT with more than 1 million TEUs per annum, becoming the main customer of the SLPA. According to MSC Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, the local agents for MSC shipping lines, another three new shipping lines under INGWE West Bound service, East Africa Express service and East Med Service will call at the POC this month. To mark MSC America’s first call at the POC, a special plaque exchange was held at the ECT of the SLPA between Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva and the Master of the vessel, Capt. Matlin Alexander. SLPA Chairman, Keith D. Bernard and several representatives of MSC Lanka (Pvt) Ltd also attended the occasion. Speaking at the occasion, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said, “With the deep draft of the East Container Terminal, there is ample potential for mega vessels to call at the port. The remaining development process of the terminal is expedited with an investment of Rs 5.9 billion. Today, a mega vessel of the MSC has contributed for container operations via the Port of Colombo. Similarly, four new services will be added to increase the capacity of the POC. That will increase our revenue. This has further strengthened the trust placed by the international shipping community in the Port of Colombo.”"

According to the President’s Media Division (PMD), the Paris Club members expressed their commitment to negotiate debt restructuring with Sri Lanka in accordance with the comparability of treatment principle with the goal of restoring debt sustainability. Saudi Arabia and India also expressed their support and commitment to provide financial assurances. The Paris Club members urged other official bilateral creditors, including China to do the same in line with IMF programme parameters, the PMD said. In a seven-point statement, the Paris Club said its members held a meeting on 25 January 2023, in the presence of representatives from Hungary, Saudi Arabia, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development and India, as well as from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to provide financing assurances to support the approval by the IMF Executive Board of the envisaged IMF programme for Sri Lanka, which would allow to restore the country’s macroeconomic stability. According to the statement, they examined the macroeconomic and financial situation of Sri Lanka, including its long-term debt sustainability, and the need for debt treatment by all bilateral creditors to both fill the financing gap and to ensure Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability in line with the proposed Extended Fund Facility. “We acknowledge that Sri Lankan authorities had the opportunity to present their economic and financial situation to its creditors, which underscored its need for debt treatment from all creditors. They also presented their reform programme that will be supported by an IMF arrangement requiring debt treatment to restore debt sustainability, as well as the prior actions already implemented. Paris Club members as well as Hungary, Saudi Arabia and India continue to look forward to working together along with all bilateral creditors and to engage with other key stakeholders to proceed with a comparable debt restructuring as soon as possible.” Shortly after the conclusion of a staff-level agreement between the Sri Lankan authorities and IMF staff on 1 September 2022, on a 48-month Extended Fund Facility arrangement, the Paris Club publicly stated its readiness to provide the necessary financing assurances in a timely manner and in coordination with other bilateral official creditors. To this end, the Paris Club has been engaging proactively with Sri Lankan authorities, the IMF, and Sri Lanka’s other official bilateral creditors, including by sharing its technical analysis to enhance the bilateral official creditors’ collective understanding of the need for debt treatment, the statement said.  “To support the implementation of the envisaged IMF supported programme and the Sri Lankan authorities’ efforts with other official bilateral creditors, Paris Club members, jointly with Hungary, expressed their full commitment to negotiate with Sri Lanka terms of a restructuring of their eligible claims, in accordance with the comparability of treatment principle among all bilateral creditors, and with the goal of restoring debt sustainability with due regard to targets and overall macroeconomic goals under the Extended Fund Facility. Saudi Arabia expressed its support for the process and acknowledged the importance to offer financing assurances in the near future. Members further expressed appreciation for the specific and credible financing assurances issued by India on 16 January 2023 and its coordination with the Paris Club. The Paris Club members as well as Hungary and Saudi Arabia urged other official bilateral creditors, including China, to do the same in line with IMF programme parameters as soon as possible. Paris Club members further noted the Sri Lankan authorities’ commitment to seek from all its commercial creditors and other official bilateral creditors a debt treatment on terms at least as favourable, and to hold all creditors in arrears until a comparable debt treatment is provided.” The Paris Club was formed in 1956. It is an informal group of official creditors whose role is to find coordinated and sustainable solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by borrower countries. A staff-level agreement was concluded between Sri Lankan authorities and the International Monetary Fund staff for a 48-month arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on 2 September. Sri Lanka’s bilateral official creditors which are Paris Club members are Japan, France, Korea, Germany, the United States of America, Spain, the Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, Austria, Canada, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Belgium, and Australia. Non-Paris Club members include China, India, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Hungary, Iran, Pakistan, and Bangladesh."

They should speak in order to free them. They should be guided towards freeing themselves from being prisoners of cruel selfishness and power hunger, he said. “We should recollect what freedom we won despite celebrating 75 years of Independence,” he said observing that a change should be created within society by religious leaders.

Dissanayake noted that Government is responsible for the education of every child and it is not fair to differentiate education of students based on their economic levels. Speaking during a meeting with teachers in Matara recently, he stated that education must be made a right through the Constitution. The True Foundation of Singapore lies in its education and in Singapore 58 per cent of the children who enter to the grade one class leave as graduates, Dissanayake said. He added 20 per cent of the students are professional diploma holders in Singapore. However, only 38,000 children who enter the first grade enter universities in Sri Lanka and it is only 11 per cent. Therefore, improving the current education system is the main task of the JJB, Dissanayake said. He promised that a JJB Government would not allow a child who enters the first grade to drop out of school without educational competence or professional competence. Speaking further Dissanayake expressed his concern that in 2016/2017, 30,000 out of 330,000 students dropped out of schools before sitting the GCE Ordinary Level examination. He said that 84 per cent of the people who were remanded in 2019 were school drop outs.  “The burden of education placed on the people should be gradually reduced. The child, the teacher and the parents should together decide what line of study the child will take after grade eight. Every parent attempts to make their children an engineer or a doctor now. We need to change the social acceptance of our professions. Every profession should be given value and respect,” he added. BY Aloka Kasturiarachchi"

Despite efforts by the government to secure loans and implement austerity measures, the country remains mired in a debt crisis and continues to seek assistance from international organisations such as the IMF. A potential solution to boost GDP, from a human resource management perspective, is to invest in the development of the country’s workforce by re-skilling and upgrading the skills of current employees and ensuring that new workers possess the necessary qualifications for high-income jobs. One way to achieve this is by shifting the focus of education from traditional secondary education to tertiary-level education for students interested in pursuing it, and providing them with the knowledge and skills required to excel in high-income jobs. Furthermore, reducing the time spent on non-essential education such as GCE OL and AL and providing education that is more relevant to the workforce can also help to increase GDP. To combat corruption, it is crucial to implement measures such as increasing transparency and accountability in government, and enforcing anti-corruption laws and regulations. Instead of solely trying to eliminate corruption, investing in education and training programmes for the youth can equip them with the skills needed to succeed in the workforce and drive economic growth. The high failure rate at GCE O/L and low enrollment in higher education can lead to limited opportunities for young people, which can contribute to social unrest. To address this, the National Wage Policy should be reviewed, and the skill sets required for jobs in Sri Lanka should be identified and improved. Upskilling the workforce to meet the skill sets required for jobs in developed countries can help to increase productivity and innovation, and can also help to increase wages and improve living standards. Furthermore, renaming jobs to match similar names in the developed world can help to increase the recognition and value of those jobs. It is worth noting that many developed countries have abolished GCE O/L and GCE A/L and have only one exam for entering tertiary education, as it is more focused on the skills and knowledge required for specific jobs. This is a model worth considering for Sri Lanka.

He said about 89 containers imported into Sri Lanka and detained by Customs were stored in the Port’s terminals and warehouses for many years and hence it has not been possible to collect a levy for the containers. This was revealed at a discussion held at the Ministry of Ports recently under the patronage of Minister de Silva. “The Ports Authority has to face a huge financial loss and huge administrative issues due to space issues in warehouses and terminals, Port Authority officials pointed out. Among them were 12 containers of areca-nuts detained in 2015, 39 containers of basmati rice detained in 2019, 15 containers of tiles detained in 2020, five containers of auto spare parts detained in 2013, four textiles and stationery containers detained in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and four alcohol and ethanol containers,” he said. Officials pointed out that the Port Authority should charge a minimum of Rs 2,445 million as ground charges from these containers. In addition, it was revealed that around 40 cars and lorries, including two Benz and Range Rover cars detained since 2015 were languishing in the terminals. Meanwhile, Customs officials pointed out that there were delays in the Customs Ordinance. De Silva said Port and Customs officials should work together to amend the outdated Customs Ordinance to carry out an efficient clearance process according to the needs of the time. As the law does not permit the Ports Authority to recover moneys from Customs warehousing fees, the Minister instructed officials to remove the 89 containers including perishable goods within a week."

She revealed these facts at a convention in Higurakgoda titled ‘Gewanna Ba; Kshudra Mulya Naya Ahosi Karanu’ (Can’t Pay; Do Away with microfinance loans). She also said the statement that microfinance loans would be cancelled was included in the Saubhagyaye Dekma policy because they requested it, and that it was limited to a single sentence. She said as far as they were concerned they had no obligation to the Government and will not settle the loans. She challenged the Government, stating that they will not settle the loans because they cannot and have no way to do so. “Our economic standing has deteriorated. We challenge the Government to do everything possible. We are proposing an outdated Law. A useless constitutional amendment has been proposed and we have been threatened with complaints against us. There are 3 million people against whom cases in this regard could be taken up. We are struggling to feed the children and serving prison sentences, this is no big deal for us,” she said.

The President said borrowings were increased to fulfil election pledges and agreed that slogans shouted at the protests were correct. He said money was borrowed more for consumption rather than for investment. He added that according to Buddhist philosophy loans should be taken for investment and not consumption.  While perpetuating Buddhism, actions he said were not in keeping with the Buddha’s teachings. Addressing the nation on the 75th Anniversary of Independence, he said the country has reached the point of destruction and there are those who want to keep perpetuating this wound forever, although he said it was not his wish. The President said, “After Independence we divided in terms of race, religion and region. The people were divided to the point of suspicion and animosity against each other. Various groups exploited this division to gain power and created further rifts among the people and instead of rejecting such groups, we gave power to these very same groups”. “In politics, lies were spread instead of the truth. Politicians who spoke the truth were rejected by the people. Those who pointed out the real situation of the country and sought related remedies were hardly given a place. Yet, those who satisfied people with their lies gained greater acceptance. We got trapped in a consensual political culture. Our characteristic was to depend on borrowed resources and we borrowed even more. We adopted the notion that, ‘The government is a spring of resources’. Many were of the view that the duty of the rulers was to distribute the various resources obtained from that spring, among the people. Accordingly, job opportunities were provided and various goods and equipment were also distributed.  Cash was also made available. In most instances, we did not vote on behalf of the country. Instead we voted for a candidate in order to get a job, to gain admission to a school for our children and to have a tender passed etc. We worked for political candidates expecting personal favours in return,” he said. He said “Most contested in the Election not for the sake of the country, but for personal power, for more perks and to earn a little more”. The President also said they were trapped in promises and endured slogans which finally resulted in the gradual collapse of the economy. “We borrowed increasingly to fulfil election pledges and he proved that the slogans shouted at the protests were correct. We borrowed more for consumption rather than for investment. However, according to the Buddhist philosophy one should take loans for investment purposes and not consumption.  While we are talking of Buddhism, our action is not in keeping with the Buddha’s teachings.” The President said there was only one way to overcome the crisis and achieve real economic and social freedom. “Youth who should work hard in different fields in this country are now standing in lengthy queues to obtain passports.  We need to change this situation too. To achieve this end we should modernise the economy and open it to the world. Corrupt political factionalism that deceived the people making them dependant and poor for ever should change.  This is the ‘system change’ that the youth of this country have been demanding for over a long period of time,” he said. The President said the Government has embarked on a new path of reform to fulfil the needs of youth and even though the decisions that have to be taken are painful, it has to be done in order to overcome the present morass..  “Hence, the basis and foundation for a strong new economy has already been formulated. We are successfully completing the difficult stage required to get support from the IMF. We expect to get their consent without delay. We cannot be satisfied just by strengthening the economy. The entire system needs to be changed. All areas of this political system, the Legislature, Parliament, Executive, State machinery, etc. should be modified to suit the modern era. For this system modification, we are proposing a number of orders to the Parliament,” he said. Speaking further he said immediate action needs to be taken in relation to the unique issues that the people in the North and East face. “A Cabinet subcommittee for this purpose has already been set up. I’m not attempting to treat the superficial condition with painkillers, but to treat the root cause of the malaise. It is challenging and difficult, but it’s our only option. I know that many of the decisions I have been compelled to take since assuming the presidency have been unpopular. We can become a developed country by 2048 if we work and move forward in a united and planned manner envisioning peace and reconciliation. There is the potential to become a developed country which is not begging from any other nation in the world. True freedom can be achieved and  it is possible,” he said."

With the deal, Washington has stitched the gap in the arc of US alliances stretching from South Korea and Japan in the north to Australia in the south. The missing link had been the Philippines, which borders two of the biggest potential flashpoints – Taiwan and the South China Sea. The deal, which in part reverses the US’ departure from their former colony more than 30 years ago, is no small matter. “There is no contingency in the South China Sea that does not require access to the Philippines,” says Gregory B Poling, director of the Southeast Asia programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “The US is not looking for permanent bases. It’s about places, not bases.” The US already had limited access to five sites under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) – the new additions and expanded access, according to a statement from Washington, will “allow more rapid support for humanitarian and climate-related disasters in the Philippines, and respond to other shared challenges”, likely a veiled reference to countering China in the region. The statement came after US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr in Manila on Thursday. The US hasn’t said where the new bases are but three of them could be on Luzon, an island on the northern edge of the Philippines, the only large piece of land close to Taiwan – if you don’t count China. China criticised the agreement, saying “US actions escalate regional tension and undermine regional peace and stability”. “The United States, out of its self-interests and zero-sum game mentality, continues to step up military posture in this region,” its embassy said in a statement. These days the US is seeking access to places where “light and flexible” operations involving supplies and surveillance can be run as and when needed, rather than bases where large numbers of troops will be stationed. In other words, this is not a return to the 1980s, when the Philippines was home to 15,000 US troops and two of the largest American military bases in Asia, at Clark Field and nearby Subic Bay.

With the deal, Washington has stitched the gap in the arc of US alliances stretching from South Korea and Japan in the north to Australia in the south. The missing link had been the Philippines, which borders two of the biggest potential flashpoints – Taiwan and the South China Sea. The deal, which in part reverses the US’ departure from their former colony more than 30 years ago, is no small matter. “There is no contingency in the South China Sea that does not require access to the Philippines,” says Gregory B Poling, director of the Southeast Asia programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “The US is not looking for permanent bases. It’s about places, not bases.” The US already had limited access to five sites under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) – the new additions and expanded access, according to a statement from Washington, will “allow more rapid support for humanitarian and climate-related disasters in the Philippines, and respond to other shared challenges”, likely a veiled reference to countering China in the region. The statement came after US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr in Manila on Thursday. The US hasn’t said where the new bases are but three of them could be on Luzon, an island on the northern edge of the Philippines, the only large piece of land close to Taiwan – if you don’t count China. China criticised the agreement, saying “US actions escalate regional tension and undermine regional peace and stability”. “The United States, out of its self-interests and zero-sum game mentality, continues to step up military posture in this region,” its embassy said in a statement. These days the US is seeking access to places where “light and flexible” operations involving supplies and surveillance can be run as and when needed, rather than bases where large numbers of troops will be stationed. In other words, this is not a return to the 1980s, when the Philippines was home to 15,000 US troops and two of the largest American military bases in Asia, at Clark Field and nearby Subic Bay.

The suicide bomber reportedly entered through the main gates of the secure zone where the mosque is located. Police Chief Moazzam Jah Ansari said they had CCTV footage revealing the man’s final movements, and were closing in on the “terror network” responsible. He also confirmed a head found at the site was the attacker’s. Monday’s blast – one of the deadliest attacks in Pakistan in years – took place at a 50-year-old mosque in a high-security police zone called Police Lines. At least 100 people were killed, of whom most were police officers. Officers failed to check the attacker as they assumed he was one of them, Ansari said. “I admit this was a security lapse. My men could not stop it. This is my fault.” He explained that police had been able to trace the bomber’s motorcycle journey before the attack using CCTV footage. As the man parked his motorcycle, he was “in a police uniform and was wearing a mask and a helmet”. After entering the compound, the attacker asked a constable where the mosque was. Ansari – who heads the force in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province – added that ball bearings had been found which were used in a suicide jacket. He said 10-12kg (22-26lb) of TNT explosives were used in the blast, which caused the mosque’s roof to collapse on the hundreds who were praying in the building. Police do not believe the man was a “lone wolf”, and have suggested there is an entire network behind him. A claim that the hard-line Islamist militant group Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out Monday’s bombing was later denied by the group, which blamed it on the commander of a breakaway faction. In the past the TTP has refrained from claiming some attacks on mosques, schools or markets, preferring to cast its violence as a war with security forces and not against the Pakistani people. (BBC)"

Formerly one of the Pope’s top aides, he was Australia’s top-ranked Catholic. But his public image was tainted by unproven allegations he both concealed and committed child sexual abuse. Those allegations loomed large in Sydney on Thursday. At one point, police outside St Mary’s Cathedral intervened to separate angry mourners from chanting protesters. Earlier, one protester was arrested. Inside the church, where Cardinal Pell served as the city’s archbishop for over a decade, dignitaries including former Prime Ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott filled pews. Hundreds more gathered in a forecourt to watch the requiem Mass on big screens. Noticeably absent were Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet – himself a devout Catholic. Both sent delegates. In a message read to the congregation, Pope Francis praised Cardinal Pell’s “dedication to the gospel and to the Church”, while Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher lauded him as “giant of the Catholic Church in Australia” who had been wrongly demonised. Over six decades, Cardinal Pell rose to prominence in the Church as a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values. He took on the role of Vatican treasurer in 2014 but left in 2017, returning to Australia to face trial on child sexual abuse charges. He was convicted, then later acquitted on appeal.Many of Cardinal Pell’s supporters believe he was unfairly persecuted, and that his record on the issue of child sexual abuse is part of what made him great. Abbott, who spoke at the funeral, claimed Cardinal Pell had been the first Australian Catholic to sack child abusers and report them to police. Others pointed to the landmark – but controversial – compensation scheme he set up. “He was greatest man I’ve ever known,” Abbott said. (BBC)"

The Minister said, the broader education transformation process is not expected to produce a group of people who memorise everything they are taught, write answers to exam papers, attend tutoring classes, and prepare to take the teacher examinations. The minister highlighted this while attending the awards ceremony of the ‘National Level Information and Communication Champions-2021’ tournament held at the Ministry of Education, while commenting on an advertisement that tutoring classes will be held for the graduate teacher examination to be held in March. Noting that undergraduate students, who want to be teachers, should be able to immediately think and understand something and act on it, such as solving a simple math problem and answering a general question, he said a generation of children cannot be created by a group of teachers who seek help in tutoring classes even to appear for the teacher recruitment examination. He also said, as a result of such events, the need for a comprehensive education transformation process has been well established and that the selections examination, to be conducted by the Examination Department, for those who pass the relevant age limit and are expected to join the State service as development officers among graduates is not a difficult competitive examination. As a result, Premajayantha expects the candidates to show up at the exam hall on time and face the test with confidence, without participating in tutoring classes.  (TR)"

Devananda and Fisheries State Minister Piyal Nishantha de Silva met CFC Trade Union (TU) representatives at Fisheries Ministry on 1 February to discuss the matter and to find a solution. Devananda added that during the discussion the TU representatives brought to their attention that the salaries of employees of CFC regional offices in Galle, Hambantota and Pesalai areas had not been paid for the past four months and the payment of Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and retirement gratuity has also been stopped as a result.  The Fisheries Minister said, it was pointed out during the discussion that due to this employees were facing severe economic difficulties and  as a result problems had arisen in running the organisation.

Spokesman for the Colombo Archbishop’s House, Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando yesterday (1) accused Sirisena of attempting to hoodwink people with false claims that he had to compensate those affected by the 2019 Easter Attacks due to the failure of officials appointed by him to carry out their duty rather than a fault of his own.   Fr. Fernando said the question was not about forgiving the former President for his apathy with regard to the 2019 Easter Attacks, but as to why he wants the Sri Lankan Catholics to forgive him when he has continued to maintain that he had not been at fault. Referring to Sirisena’s appeal for forgiveness from Sri Lanka’s Catholic Community on Tuesday (31) while announcing his intention to contest for 2024 Presidential Elections at a media briefing in Colombo, Fr. Fernando said Sirisena’s request was devoid of sincerity and were just empty words. “If one is asking to be forgiven then he or she has to accept the fault. The Supreme Court has noted that at the time of the bombing President Sirisena had held the portfolio as Defence Minister and been in charge of the Police, State Intelligence Service. It is against the principles of the Constitution to differentiate between the Police Department and State Intelligence which is what the former President did when he gave an affidavit stating the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the Defence Secretary were bound to keep him informed regarding the security situation, and that the Director of State Intelligence was not bound by that duty.” The Court stated that the former President and the SIS Director had tended affidavits that gave out false distinctions that were artificial and had no legal or constitutional basis. The Supreme Court said Sirisena had violated human rights and that therefore he should pay compensation to those affected in the bombings. “It is not because of the officials he appointed but because as the Defence Minister, Maithripala Sirisena was bound to ensure the safety of the public by monitoring institutions which were under his purview,” the Spokesman for the Colombo Archbishop said, explaining the Supreme Court verdict. He said the Court had also noted that the former President’s abject failure had brought disastrous consequences to this country and not only destroyed lives and property, but also broken its whole fabric by paving the way for inter-communal crises and hatred amongst races. “Sirisena as an SLFP candidate has the right to contest the Presidential Elections again if the law did not hinder him. But while he held the post he failed in one of his primary duties of safeguarding the lives of his people,” Fr. Fernando said.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando stated. Addressing the media yesterday (1) at the Colombo Archbishop’s House, Fr. Fernando lambasted the Government over the colossal amount of public funds being spent for the Independence Day celebration. He noted that the Catholic Church opposed such waste at a time when the country’s economy is in a bad state. What should happen is all political parties, that have ruled this country for the past 75 years and shoved it towards this state of bankruptcy, should admit their mistakes publicly and ask the people for their forgiveness, he said. “Measures should be taken to bring all those responsible for robbing the country before the law and wrest all stolen money from them. What Independence can be celebrated spending Rs 200 million, when the country is unable to pay back the foreign loans that had been obtained, when, according to a report issued by the World Food Programme (WFP), 30 per cent of its population was suffering from hunger and 33.4 per cent children below the age of five years were suffering from malnutrition,” he queried. “According to the WFP 86 per cent families were able to obtain only food that had low nutritional value at a cheap price, he said noting that the Government was going begging for loans from country to country for funds to purchase food, fuel, pharmaceuticals and other essentials. The income of the majority population has plummeted while they were being distressed by the increasing cost of living. The Government on the other hand was only piling up direct and indirect taxes on the already suffering public,” he said. The Spokesman for the Colombo Archbishop’s House expressed the Church’s reservations on how the Government thought to celebrate 75 years of Independence when people were losing jobs, when small enterprises were collapsing, when the rule of law was being grossly violated and human rights were being desecrated without any qualms. People’s right to speech and to hold peaceful demonstrations were being violated by misusing Acts like the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). “To say the least the Government was unable to maintain 24 hour power supply at least for the sake of children sitting their GCE Advance Level Examinations during this period,” he lamented. Fr. Fernando accused the Government of spending such a colossal sum of money to celebrate Independence when it had come to a situation that it was unable to maintain the State health service with the provision of medicines and healthcare facilities thereby compromising the lives of patients. Fr. Fernando, who is also the Editor of the ‘Gnanartha Pradeepaya,’ the Catholic Publication, said that there was a question as to whether the citizens were able to proudly celebrate 75 years of Independence from the British rule  when it was doubtful as to whether “our people had a present and a future to talk about with pride.” By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

This was when the Writ Application filed by 176 consultant specialist doctors, challenging the decision to reduce the compulsory retirement age of doctors to 60 years, was taken up before Court of Appeal Justices Sobitha Rajakaruna and Dhammika Ganepola. The petitioners said that the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, dated 17 October, has been made illegally and in complete violation of their legitimate expectation to continue in service at least until 63 years of age. The Petitioners’ position is that since 2017, as consultant specialist doctors, they have been guaranteed a defined compulsory age of retirement of 63 years, by both Cabinet Decisions as well as by the Amendment to the Minute on Pensions and therefore, that they were distinctly identified as a separate category, different and separate to that of other categories of public officers in general and that this status and legitimate expectation had been continuing for a period of 5 years, from 2017 up to 2022.

This book was completed on the occasion of the 200th Anniversary of the Great Rebellion against British colonial rule in Uva Wellassa in 1818 and shows how Sri Lanka, which had been an independent country for over 2,000 years, lost its independence due to oppression by imperialists. This book highlights a strong argument that compensation should be paid for the atrocities committed against humanity during that period. Speaking at this occasion, the Premier said it is the responsibility of the Government to take action in this regard. “The reports submitted by the Buddhist Commission and  Udarata Rural Rehabilitation Commission have presented the damage done to Sri Lanka by the imperialists and the Government has a responsibility to take action in that regard,” the Prime Minister said.

One section is scheduled to be sent to the port of Singapore (Yard). However, State Minister of Urban Development Authority Arundika Fernando has instructed the wreck removing Chinese company, Shanghai Salvage, to fulfil all legal requirements including making a payment to the Port Customs first, before removing the vessel from Sri Lankan waters. The Chinese company had already removed the ship’s accommodation section and was about to sail to Singapore when the Minster announced that the removal company should do the needful.    The other part of the ship, which is still under water, would be removed as scheduled before March, said Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) Chair, Dharshani Lahandapura. MEPA had delegated the wreck removal and underwater debris removal projects to two separate companies, arranged by the ship owners. Shanghai Salvage removed the wreck, and Resolve Marine removed the underwater debris, last year. The wreck’s cut section is on the submersible barge. According to the MEPA Chairperson, ship breaking is prohibited in Sri Lanka under the Central Environmental Act, so the wreck must be relocated. She also said while the removal was taking place they did not notice any oil slicks or any other marine or environmental damages. The remaining parts of the ship would be removed before May this year, she added. The MEPA team presented its second interim report, to Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, in which it mentioned that a USD 6.5 billion compensation claim, as part of the recommendations made by marine experts, to vessel owners. However, Lahandapura stated that the final report for the environmental damage will be issued after the entire wreck has been removed and the damage caused during the removal as well as the condition of the water has been studied.

Announcing the release order, the Chief Magistrate mentioned that the suspect was not found to have committed any offence under the Provisions of the PTA. Chief Magistrate Alwis explained that though charges had been filed against the suspect, as per the Provisions in the PTA, none of those charges had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt via the evidence put forth in Court by the prosecution. He noted that the Court, had also taken cognizance of statements that had been made by various individuals, related to the incident. The Chief Magistrate mentioned, in his order, that though the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) had put forth statements made by Piyumal Samarasinghe alias ‘Motivation Appachchi’, against the suspect, for having allegedly taken over a protest demonstration organised by Samarasinghe, the TID had failed to submit sufficient evidence in Court to prove it. He then remarked that the TID had also been unable to prove the evidence submitted to Court, via another witness Gemunu Wijeratne, who had maintained that groups such as the IUSF had been funded by global terrorist organisations. Chief Magistrate Alwis pointed out, that during the protest demonstration, a Police Inspector, named Wijeyamuni, had provided a statement to the Police, that he had been assaulted by the suspect concerned, but noted that evidence submitted, had proved otherwise. The Court stated that the Inspector had made up the statement to the Police, with the hidden intention of further incarcerating the suspect. The Court, in its release order, also observed that an ASP of the Police Department, Rodrigo had provided a statement to the Police, on 1 January this year, that the suspect had insulted him in front of the Police Department, but that the Court is not convinced with the authenticity or the transparency of the ASP’s statement. The Chief Magistrate opined in his release order, that the dubious and contradictory statements given to the Police, by some of their officers had clearly shown the intent of those officers, to create the impression that they had been physically accosted and verbally insulted by the suspect, while misusing the Provisions of the PTA, to imprison him. Furthermore, Chief Magistrate Alwis, remarked that though the Police had charged another suspect, with causing damage to public property and public places, to date no details had been submitted to him in that regard. Hence, the Chief Magistrate added that perusal of evidence produced before him, has convinced him that the TID had wilfully misused the Provisions of the PTA, to incarcerate the suspect via concocted statements by various Police Officers. Accordingly, the Court acquitted Wasantha Mudalige of the charges filed against him and released from the case. The IUSF Convener’s legal counsel had previously requested his release, on the grounds that there wasn’t any level of facts or evidence, to remand him under the Provisions of the PTA. However, as a few other cases, filed against the suspect before the said Court are yet pending, he was taken back to the Prison. Senior Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris prosecuted on behalf of the Attorney General’s Department, while a group of lawyers headed by President’s Counsel Saliya Peiris, looked into the interests of the suspect.

I read the Bible when I was 15 years old. When I visit areas where majority of the residents are Catholics, I am always welcomed cordially by them,” he claimed. Sirisena publicly apologised to the Catholic community, including the victims and their family members, for the Easter Sunday bombings, which took place during his tenure as the President. Sirisena also claimed that the Supreme Court verdict clearly stated that he, as the then President, had not been informed of the intelligence information, on the Easter attacks by the responsible officials. However, the President should take the responsibility for any offences committed by any official appointed by him, he said. “I only have to pay compensations because of a mistake made by others. I was not informed of a possible terror attack on 21 April 2019. But, as the President at that time, I have to take the responsibility of the mistakes done by the officials who were under my purview,” he said. Mentioning the life of the Father of Modern South Africa Nelson Mandela, Sirisena said he has read the life story of Mandela, who was imprisoned for 27 years and won the Presidential election right after he was released from prison. “Likewise, I believe, I too can overcome all the conspiracies against me and I should say that I am not a man who will back down from anything. I will contest the next Presidential Election with the support of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). I believe I could win the election with SLFP support,” Sirisena added. Moreover, Sirisena said that although he was ordered to pay a compensation of Rs 100 million, to the victims of the terror attack, he cannot afford it, as he only has one income, a monthly-based salary. However, he assured that he will pay it with the help of acquaintances. BY Aloka Kasturiarachchi"

Jude Krishantha Fernando, responding to SLFP Leader Sirisena’s appeal for forgiveness from the Catholics in Sri Lanka, and his announcement that he will contest the next Presidential Election, said Sirisena should have stepped down as President on the very day of the Easter attacks and not apologise after a lapse of four years when announcing his intention to run for President. He alleged that the SLFP Leader was now struggling owing to the pressure he felt from the Supreme Court ruling and the resultant blow to his future political aspirations. “But if the SLFP Leader genuinely wants to be forgiven for the Easter Attacks, he should resign from all positions he holds now and have an audience with the Cardinal who is the Head of the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka and the Catholic Community to ask for clemency,” he said. Fr. Fernando said the former President should also seek pardon from the nation for risking the country’s security by failing to take action despite being informed of the 21 April 2019, Easter Sunday Attacks.

The EC Chairman said after the 21st Amendment is passed, the tenure of independent commissions including the EC will lapse. “However, the 21st Amendment facilitated to continue the functions of the independent commissions without disruptions until new members are appointed.” “According to the reports we received after the Constitutional Council meeting, appointing members to the independent commissions will take at least 2-3 months, after publishing newspaper advertisements. Therefore, it will not affect the upcoming election. Even if new members are appointed to the EC, they can continue the work we have started with regard to the LG Polls,” Punchihewa said.  By Methmalie Dissanayake"

Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardana said Trade Minister Nalin Fernando informed Cabinet that certain Government authorities and institutions are objecting and obstructing egg imports. In response to Fernando’s claim, the President has requested that a report be prepared and presented at the next Cabinet meeting. Gunawardana queried as to why the authorities are objecting to egg imports from countries that have a history of exporting eggs to many nations. “The Sinhala and Tamil New Year is around the corner and the egg shortage that has been created now could worsen during the festive season. It is natural for egg prices to rise during the holiday season. Cabinet was of the opinion that eggs should be imported to alleviate the shortage,” he said. Speaking further, Gunawardana said India is a prominent exporter of eggs and that anyone objecting to egg imports should provide solid proof to support their claims. He underlined that imported eggs will be distributed to hospitals, bakeries, and schools for children’s lunch. He admitted that the scarcity of eggs and the high cost of eggs are major issues for families with school-aged and young children. By Thameenah Razeek"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

Speaking to TOI, Moragoda said no other country would have helped Sri Lanka the way India did and that Foreign Minister S Jaishankar’s recent visit to Colombo, his third in the past 12 months, marked the entry of the bilateral relationship into a new phase. It also marked, he said, the beginning of Lanka’s economic recovery. Jaishankar was in Colombo last month to express solidarity with Sri Lanka and he said during his visit India’s financing assurances to the IMF were meant to clear the way for Sri Lanka to move forward and in line also with India’s expectation that all bilateral creditors are dealt with equally. Sri Lanka is currently awaiting similar assurances from China and Japan, other major bilateral lenders. While Beijing has written to Sri Lanka offering a debt moratorium for two years and support for securing IMF’s proposed USD 2.9 billion bailout package, reports from Colombo suggest it’s not clear yet if the international lender, unlike in the case with India, is satisfied with China’s assurances. The timing was very important. India’s support overall and the fact that it took the lead can be hailed as an example of India’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy. There would have been more social fallout of the crisis otherwise, said Moragoda, adding that India’s assurances are also in keeping with the requirements of Paris Club creditor nations which are helping Sri Lanka with debt restructuring. Protesters last year swarmed the residence of then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, following acute food and fuel shortages in the country that resulted from Lanka’s debt crisis, leading finally to the exit of the Rajapaksas from power. Moragoda said Sri Lanka is looking to attract more investments from India through cooperation in areas like renewables, power grid connectivity, refineries, tourism, trade expansion and proposed divestments in telecom and insurance companies. Plans to turn Trincomalee into a petroleum hub and use rupee for trade settlement are also under consideration. Jaishankar had said in Colombo that India will encourage investments in core areas like energy, infrastructure and tourism. Significantly, Moragoda said India’s support will help address the trust deficit between the two countries, which has often been exacerbated by China’s ever-increasing footprints. “We went through some rough patches but what’s important is that we kept communication going. We were frank and candid. There will be ups and downs but what India did for us, no other country would have done.” India was the first country to provide financing assurances to the IMF as it sought proactive action by all creditors to help the nation of 22 million people. India and Sri Lanka are currently working to finalise dates for a visit by President Ranil Wickremesinghe soon. Jaishankar had delivered an invite to the president when he called on him during his visit. On Jaishankar’s call for implementation of the 13th Amendment, which seeks devolution of power to the Tamil minority, and early conduct of provincial elections, Moragoda said Wickremesinghe had been working to bring all parties together from the day he was sworn in. “Ìt’s complex in Sri Lanka. It’s difficult to speak in terms of timelines but the president is trying. This issue has been on the table for 75 years and the 13th Amendment has served as a framework for settlement. Right now, Sri Lanka is faced with a bigger crisis, an existential one, and it’s important everybody gets together,” he said. (Times Of India ) By SACHIN PARASHAR "

No. 5 Fighter Squadron was formed with the arrival of four F-7BS fighters, one FT-7B trainer and two FT-5 trainers on 1 February 1991. Squadron Leader H.D. Abeywickrema was appointed as its first Commanding Officer. Air Force Commander, Air Marshal Sudarshana Pathirana was also a founder member of the No. 5 Fighter Squadron. Then Squadron Leader P. Gunasinghe, Flight Lieutenant S.K. Pathirana, Flight Lieutenant I.J.I. Wijetilleke and Flight Lieutenant S. Hendawitharane were the initial pilots in SLAF history to break the speed of sound and be considered the pioneers of the supersonic fighter age. The Squadron’s initial operations commenced from SLAF Base Katunayake, but were soon shifted to SLAF China Bay in 1994 to reduce response time and to act promptly for operational requirements during the war time. However, due to security concerns, it was later shifted back to its home base in Katunayake in 1996. To enhance the No. 5 Fighter Squadron’s Air Interdiction and specialised low-level strike capability, six Russian MiG-27 and one MiG-23UB trainer were inducted to the squadron in 2000. 2007 was a remarkable year for the SLAF and the No. 5 Fighter Squadron in terms of fleet enhancements. The modern F-7GS which is the advanced version of the F-7BS in relation to avionics, including an AI Radar, sophisticated weapons delivery system with air-to-air missile strike capability, and a user-friendly glass cockpit, was inducted. Much-needed and well-maintained SLAF air superiority over the nation was threatened with the emergence of the LTTE Air Wing, followed by the first airspace intrusion on 26 March 2007. The newly introduced F-7 ‘Air Guard’ fighters were called upon with expectations that they would live up to their literal reputation as the first supersonic interceptors with air-to-air strike capability. The squadron has been headed by ten Commanding Officers. Shouldering its responsibility as the cradle of fighter pilots, the squadron has produced over 25 pilots who were the front-line fighters to face the brutal enemy counterattacks, delivering tons of explosives to weaken the enemy’s morale to fight back in the prolonged Eelam Wars. No. 5 Squadron has contributed its effort promptly and effectively whenever it was called on with distinction and honour performing a multitude of Counter Air and Counter Surface Force Operations and conducting over 600 flying sorties during the humanitarian operations. The results of these efforts were clearly manifested in the nation’s ultimate victory over terrorism. No. 5 Fighter Squadron, which was also awarded the President’s Colours on 5 March 2021 for its valiant contribution, continues to render its service to the nation as the leading Air Defence platform guarding the skies of our motherland and will continue to prosper in the future with the latest updates and a highly trained crew."

Sri Lanka ranks at 101 in 2022, along with Panama, Albania, Kazakhstan, Serbia, Ecuador, Peru and Thailand,” TI said. The CPI scores 180 countries and territories around the world based on perceptions of public sector corruption. The scores reflect the views of experts and surveys from the business sector. The CPI is calculated using data from 13 external sources, including the World Bank, World Economic Forum, private risk and consulting companies and think tanks. The CPI uses a scale from 0 to 100, whereby 100 is considered very clean and 0 is considered highly corrupt. Over the past 10 years, Sri Lanka’s CPI score has remained relatively the same, from the highest being 40 in 2012 and the lowest being 36, which is the score this year and was the score in 2016. The top countries on the Index are Denmark (90), Finland (87) and New Zealand (87) while South Sudan (13), Syria (13) and Somalia (12) remain at the bottom of the CPI in 2022. Types of public sector corruption and related criteria captured in the CPI encompass bribery, diversion of public funds, and effective prosecution of corruption cases, adequate legal frameworks, and access to information, and legal protections for whistleblowers, journalists and investigators. Meanwhile, Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) said Sri Lanka too demonstrates the same lack of progress in terms of resisting corruption, coupled with suppression of civil society, culminating from a lack of political will to change the system, even amidst the crippling effects of kleptocracy on the country’s economy and on the quality of life of citizens. TISL urges the Government to recall how Sri Lankans of all walks of life came together in protest against those who were responsible for the bankruptcy of the nation, understanding the very close connection between corruption, poor governance, the country’s economy and their day-to-day lives. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on which the Government is depending to resuscitate the fallen economy, also emphasised the need to reduce corruption vulnerabilities, by improving fiscal transparency, public financial management and a stronger anti-corruption legal framework. While the Government is in critical need to attract foreign investment, tourism and other income generation methods along with debt restructuring, foreign aid and other support from the international community to be able to secure the essentials for the people, it is paramount that the trust in the Government, the Legislature and the public sector be restored within and outside of Sri Lanka.  TISL also recalls the essential anti-corruption reforms that it urged the Government to implement to revive the economy, none of which stand implemented as at this day."

The HRCSL said notwithstanding the settlement arrived by the above parties, to provide uninterrupted electricity for the A/L students, during the period of the examination, the CEB wilfully and maliciously disregarded the settlement and continued with the power cuts.  They added that the settlement was to prevent the power cut only during the period of the A/L examination while stating that the blatant disregard of the CEB to provide an uninterrupted electricity supply during the examination period is a gross violation of a child’s right to education.  The HRCSL said that having admitted before the Commission that there are meaningful ways to provide electricity, and settling on that basis, the CEB disregarded the assurance and proceeded with the power cut.  They said the unbecoming and outrageous behaviour of the State Officials of the CEB is an intentional affront to justice and contempt of the HRCSL. Thereby, HRCSL has signed a certificate of contempt and forwarded it to the Supreme Court and a case of Contempt of Court was also filed before the Supreme Court in this regard.                         (FT)"

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) faction of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) has chosen to boycott the 75th Independence Day celebrations and stage its own protest in Kallady, Batticaloa. MPs M.A. Sumanthrian and Shanakiyan Rasamanickam of Batticaloa will lead this protest. Sumanthiran claimed that despite receiving an official invitation from the Government to attend the Independence Day celebration in Colombo, they chose to assemble in Kallady instead and raise a black flag when the Sri Lankan flag was raised in Colombo, said Rasamanickam. Meanwhile, Jaffna MP Selvam Adaikkalanathan stated that their split party, the ‘new TNA,’ will join the Jaffna University Students in their protest parade on 1 February and travel for four days in vehicles to reach the Eastern University of Batticaloa on 4 February. They intend to stop in various locations along their journey from the North to the East. Preparation is underway for the vehicle parade of the Jaffna University students to join the black day protest. Sumanthiran stated that they would declare 4 February as a ‘Black Day’ and launch a campaign to achieve true freedom. “Immediately after independence, it was transformed into a majority system under the guise of democracy. That is why other people in this country do not have freedom,” he explained. “The Sinhala Buddhists believed they had gained freedom. However, they now believe that they did not obtain freedom.” It is unclear whether Tamil National People’s Front (TNPF) Leader MP Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam and Leader of Tamil Makkal Kootani (TMK) MP C.V. Wigneswaran will also participate in the Black Day protest. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Karunaratne made this remark in a statement released to the media on Sunday (29). He said the Gazette Notification with the signatures of EC Chairman and members, had not been sent to the Government Printer so far. In a scathing statement, signed by the EC Secretary yesterday (30), the commission said it is hard to understand the intention behind Karunaratne’s statement as the notification with regard to holding the election is published by the Returning Officers under the Section 38 of the Local Government (Amendment) Act No 16 of 2017. “The election process was started on 4 January after the notification calling for nominations by the Returning Officers. The Director General has forgotten that fact. This is the normal process and this is what happened in previous elections. The signatures of the EC Chairman and the members are not needed for that. It seems the Director General lacked this basic legal knowledge when issuing the above statement,” the EC said. The relevant notice was handed over to the Government Printer on Monday (30) by the Returning Officers to publish it in the Government Gazette. “It is sad that the Director General of Government Information has made his post ‘lousy’ by issuing statements without having a proper knowledge,” the EC said.

They added that a sum of Rs 110 is being incurred by them towards the production of a kilo of paddy and hence they urged the Government to impose a certified price while striving to purchase paddy from them.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/01/31/who-turns-light-back-on-neglected-tropical-diseases/,WHO TURNS LIGHT BACK ON ‘NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES’,Author not found,0,2023-01-30T20:30:00+00:00,"The World Health Organisations (WHO) called on countries and communities in the South-East Asia Region to mark this year’s ‘Neglected Tropical Diseases’ (NTDs) Day by  making bold, sustainable investments to help free the one billion people globally who were vulnerable to their devastating health, social and economic costs. “NTDs are a diverse group of 20 conditions that are mainly prevalent in tropical areas.” Globally, they affect more than one billion people, cost low- and middle-income countries billions of dollars every year, and perpetuate a cycle of poor educational outcomes and limited professional opportunities, mostly for impoverished communities, where they disproportionately affect women and children. The WHO South-East Asia Region accounts for the second highest NTD burden globally. At least one NTD is endemic to each of the Region’s 11 Member States, and more than 938 million people in the Region require interventions against NTDs. In 2021, the Region accounted for 59% of the global population requiring interventions against lymphatic filariasis (LF), 66.5% of new cases of leprosy, and 56% of children requiring regular de-worming against soil-transmitted helminthiases. Since 2014, WHO has supported countries of the Region to make rapid, equitable and sustained progress against NTDs in line with the Region’s Flagship Priority on eliminating NTDs and other diseases on the verge of elimination. In 2016 India was declared yaws-free. Maldives, Thailand and Sri Lanka have eliminated lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem. Bangladesh is currently being assessed for validation of elimination of LF as a public health problem, and Timor-Leste is now under post-treatment surveillance. Nepal and Myanmar have eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. All kala-azar-endemic implementation units in Bangladesh have now reached the elimination target, which India and Nepal are also close to achieving. India, Indonesia and Nepal continue to roll out triple drug therapy to accelerate action against LF, which Myanmar is also preparing to introduce. Between 2010 and 2020, the Region reduced the total number of people who require interventions against NTDs by a remarkable 20%. Across the Region, new challenges and opportunities have emerged. In 2021, WHO launched a global NTD road map that aims to ‘End the neglect’, setting a series of global targets and milestones to prevent, control, eliminate or eradicate NTDs, as well as cross-cutting targets that are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. In implementing the road map, the Region aims to accelerate momentum on its Flagship Priority, with a focus on several priorities. “On an array of NTDs – kala-azar, LF, trachoma and yaws – the Region has made tremendous, path-breaking progress. But where appropriate, countries should increasingly broaden their scope, for example by intensifying action to address snakebite envenoming – for which a new Regional action plan has now been launched – as well as dog-mediated rabies, dengue, schistosomiasis and other parasitic zoonoses such as taeniasis, echinococcosis and food-borne trematodiases.”"

He said, “As the state of our economy improves, wages should rise and earning should be boosted.” “Being a politician makes it tough to speak this truth. But I always reveal the truth, even if I win or lose. I request everyone to support Parliament to get out of this difficult situation for the people. The Paris Club including Japan has accepted and discussed our proposals together and also discussed them with India. The proposal has now been approved by China. With this situation, we receive foreign currency by February. Then, these issues can be resolved in a methodical manner. We need to build a new economy. The Anuradhapura kingdom had no debt. It was a powerful kingdom. In order to strengthen the economy, we must keep that in mind,” he said. Speaking further the President said the income earned on 25 January 2023 was Rs 145 billion and when all capital costs, such as wages, pensions, and welfare, are considered it amounts to Rs 143 billion. He said in addition, an additional Rs 355 billion is required to discharge the loan and in January, the Government spent a total of Rs 498 billion. “But we make Rs 145 billion annually. We can bounce back from this situation over time if a structured programme is put in place. In addition, there are other issues in 2022, including a Rs 794 billion loss in State institutions. This year, we don’t have the funds to pay for them. Therefore, we must make up for this loss. Everyone is currently being affected by the electricity bill issue,” he said. The President made this observation at the ceremeny where the Akta Pathra was presented to the new Atamasthanadhipathi, the Chief Sangha Nayaka of the Siam Maha Nikaya, Malwathu Chapter, Nuwara Kalaviya, Most Venerable Dr. Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera at the Jayasri Maha Bodhiya premises. “The IMF has informed us that we have to get tax revenue and that other countries will not provide tax revenue for our country. They pointed out that common people have the highest tax expenses in our country. In countries like Thailand, tariffs account for 2.8 per cent of government revenue. 30.1 per cent is obtained from income taxes. India receives 4.5 per cent from tariffs and 45.6 per cent from income tax. Our country receives 26.3 per cent from Customs duty and 17.7 per cent from income tax. Therefore, the IMF informed that when taxes are raised, income tax should be raised and that low-income earners will be inconvenienced due to the collection of taxes, I agree that we are all in a difficult situation. We have worked to provide a good harvest to farmers in the Maha season. All of us are bearing the pressure caused by the increase in the price of goods, transportation costs and oil.  We are unable to avoid this,” he said. He said his aim is to build a debt-free economy within the next five to ten years where people can live with a sense of pride and without having to bow their heads to anyone, as it was during the Anuradhapura era where the country maintained a strong and debt-free economy. The President also said if government revenue is stabilised marking progress in the economy, an extra allowance is expected to be granted to public servants in the third quarter of this year as a relief measure. Stating that he had a good understanding of the difficulties faced by the people, the President expressed confidence that with the expected economic progress expected to be achieved by 2024, relief to all, including salary increases could be provided. “Last April, we informed the world that we were not in a position to repay our debts. After assuming duties as the President, I made a request from the IMF about restructuring our debts. I notified them that the loans we had obtained were very high, and the country was not in a position to repay them. In order to be able to repay the loans, it was suggested to discuss with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and prepare a plan. Countries such as China, Japan and India, which gave us loans, told us to first discuss with the IMF and prepare a plan. Then it was informed that assistance that can be provided by those countries will be discussed. Therefore, we had to discuss with the IMF how to repay these loans. We cannot continue without this support. If we don’t get this support, our economy will collapse. Funds and foreign exchange in our country are not sufficient,” he said. Speaking further he said last year our economic growth rate was minus 11 per cent. This year, if we plan properly, we can make it minus 3.5 per cent. But, in the event there are global issues, it could even be minus 4 per cent. However, we expect to bring it down to minus 3.5 per cent.  “With this aim in focus, we expect to move the economy forward from 2024. We have received some aid due to the measures we took when we ran out of dollars. We are expected to receive more assistance in the future. Similarly, we will have an excess of paddy due to the success of the season this year with the provision of fertilizers. The country will revert to the state it was in May, June, and July of last year if we abandon this initiative. If that occurs, you will encounter another challenge. If that occurs, we won’t have any money left over for even three weeks to purchase medication,” he said. Speaking further he said the countries that provided us with loans advised that their revenue had also reduced and that it would be difficult to provide their support if their citizens could not bear the majority of the burden to deal with this problem. “Because they disclosed that the funding was obtained from taxes paid by their citizens. In 2019 our total revenue is 15 per cent of the gross domestic product. However, as a result of the tax reduction, the total income has decreased to 8.4 per cent of the gross domestic product by 2022. Those countries informed us if assistance is provided we should raise the total revenue to 15 per cent of the gross domestic product to the level of 2019. Accordingly, the current income should be increased by 75 per cent during the next three years. That is our challenge. That will require you to carry a heavy burden. However, we can go on. We are unable to refute the facts that they give,” he said. Explaining the situation further, he said he had 1500,000 files in 2019 that paid their income tax in full. Next, there were 122,000 files that pay VAT and Nation Development Taxes (NDT). “There were 1600,000 files in total. With the subsequent removal of these taxes, by December 2021, we had 400,000 income tax files. It had reduced from 1600,000 to 400,000. Accordingly, they questioned us on how could they give us the taxes they collected from their people when we reduce the collection of these taxes. It is that we have worked to bring about this state of taxation. Without this step, we cannot move forward,” the President said.

He said one of the additional secretaries and an additional general manager from the CPC, as well as the financial manager of CEB, attended the meeting called by the HRCSL. He said these personnel informed Wijesekara in writing that they were influenced by the HRCSL and that these officials informed the HRCSL that all decisions must be approved by the board of directors. “The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka and HRCSL have no authority to compel any institution to provide fuel on credit for 60 or 70 days. I am not sure if the HRCSL can persuade banks to lower their interest rates. In the future, the HRCSL will convene the CBSL and ask to change the tax policy because it is not in the best interests of humanity,” he said. Wijesekara pointed out that according to an affidavit, CPC officials have been threatened with jail terms by the HRCSL. “Such allegations are extremely serious. I was also told that the entire conversation had been recorded and that it would be useful when we went to court. I was also informed that when the first document was signed, it was torn down after mentioning in the document that it was signed under the approval of the board of directors. However, after signing the document, the official took a picture of it before tearing it down and shared it with the CPC Chairman. We have it as well,” he added. He said that it is good that the HRCSL has to go to court because the HRCSL officials cannot influence or direct the CPC or CEB to act according to their instructions. “The officials who attended the meeting claimed that the HRCSL officials’ actions on that day violated their human rights,” he said.

Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said all parliamentarians from the ruling party agreed on the decision and the majority required is thus in place. Speaking to the media yesterday (29), Minister Wijesekera said Ratnayake made statements and decisions arbitrarily, putting the entire country in jeopardy. He claimed Ratnayake is to blame for the power outages, as he misled the other PUCSL members. He said there are enough provisions in Parliament to dismiss Ratnayake. “We are working within limited constraints. We are also collating a lot of information about Ratnayake. Before being appointed as PUCSL Chairman, Ratnayake asked former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to appoint him as the Chairman of a leading private bank. Ratnayake’s name was sent to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to obtain an eligibility report, but CBSL later rejected it, stating that they cannot provide such a report, citing other reasons and criticisms,” he said. Wijesekera raised concerns about how the Constitutional Council in Parliament overlooked this information. He claimed that a select committee in Parliament had pointed out that Ratnayake wasn’t qualified to work at a state institution in 2012. He said he is working on the matter from a legal standpoint.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He said he is eager to see what is on the charge sheet against him. He was responding to Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera’s claim that a charge sheet against him (Ratnayake) will be presented in Parliament, seeking his removal as PUCSL Chair. “I’m eagerly waiting to face the charge sheet which is said to have been prepared by Minister Kanchana Wijesekera. I do not have any charges filed against me unlike against Wijesekera,” he said. Meanwhile, Ratnayake chastised Wijesekera for intimidating the independent commission and refusing to work in accordance with the Commission’s decisions. He said he had not received any formal recommendation or letter from the Attorney General regarding the Cabinet-approved electricity tariff hike, and that once he does, he will take necessary action regarding the electricity tariff hike. Speaking to the media yesterday (29), he said Wijesekera is sharing a letter purportedly sent by the Attorney General with the members of the commission via WhatsApp and other informal channels. He pointed out that Wijesekera has no business to deal with the letter and questioned why the minister is so concerned about a letter that he (Ratnayake) should be receiving. “The document I am supposed to receive from the Attorney General is a formal business transaction between us two. Political parties or individuals are not permitted to intervene in this matter. This is an example of political intimidation of independent commissions. The National Council influences the Commission in one way while the Cabinet influences the Commission in another. PUCSL members are contacted 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This is a joke. We are not allowed to work independently,” he said. Wijesekera told the media yesterday (29) that Ratnayake had received an email from the Attorney General about the Cabinet-approved electricity tariff hike and challenged Ratnayake to act immediately if he does not have any hidden political agenda. However, Ratnayake refuted Wijesekera’s claims that he (Ratnayake) is preparing to enter politics on the National List from any party with the ‘Helicopter’ or ‘Telephone’ symbols in the upcoming Local Government Election.

Karunawardene said this while addressing the 12th Annual Research Symposium – 2022 of the NBRO themed ‘Building resilience amidst economic challenges’ held at the BMICH recently. He said the economic constraints further intensify these challenges. Financial constraints also negatively influence communities who are already vulnerable to disaster. In the recent past, the NBRO has extended its services to other technical agencies to address issues related to land development, regulating the construction and development and sustainable disaster mitigation, according to Karunawardene. “Apart from its key services, providing proper guidelines and consultancies to develop the land in disaster-prone areas, geological and geotechnical engineering services, measuring the structural condition of opulent buildings, quality control and standardisation of building materials and real-time assessment of urban air quality are among the key services that NBRO provides,” the Director General said. He said the NBRO has been vested with the duty of identifying and mitigating the landslide-prone locations and 27 early landslide warning centres are presently functioning under the purview of the NBRO and monitoring the situation, with 330 rain gauges installed in catchment areas. “We are jointly working with the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) to disseminate early warnings to persons in disaster-prone areas. We are able to issue accurate early warnings with the technical and financial assistance from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).  A mobile app was developed last year with the help of Japanese and JICA experts to notify the people in the landslide-prone areas of possible landslide occurrences. The NBRO will be able to disseminate the message in a timely fashion,” according to Karunawardene. Landslide mitigation work in Malabattawa area in Walapane in the Nuwara Eliya District and the mitigation work of Kadugannawa have already commenced. A landslide-prone location has been identified in Nallathanniya area in Hatton. The NBRO is looking to mitigate it as soon as possible. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

The particular project was initially aimed at providing lunch to 1.1 million school children. Speaking to Ceylon Today, yesterday (26) Stalin alleged that as a result the children will be facing a severe risk of malnutrition and hunger when schools re-open for the next term. Stalin assured that the CTU will take immediate trade union action against the non payment to the suppliers, if the authorities failed to provide a solution immediately. He noted that CTU discussed this with the Education Minister who assured that he will look into it immediately. He also urged the government to make the overdue payments to suppliers. “The government launched the nutritional project, targeting 1.1 million school children. The programme was launched with the help of Samurdhi beneficiaries, who served as the primary food suppliers. It was introduced by the Education Ministry. The suppliers have incurred significant losses as a result of the government’s failure to make payments for nearly four months,” he added. Stalin noted that a Cabinet decision was taken on 23 October 2022, to increase the number of children, under this free lunch programme to two million, but with the existing difficulties it is likely that the programme may not continue in the next term. “We had a discussion in this regard with the Education Minister on Tuesday (24). But the minister claimed that the payments would be settled only after obtaining funds from the Treasury. The World Bank (WB) has already granted five billion rupees as a donation to implement the project. I wonder what happened to that donation?” Stalin said.

The Prime Minister, the Speaker, former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena were invited to the APC too. Meanwhile, TPA Leader Mano Ganesan stressed that President has not held talks on the issues related to Hill Country Tamils who are national minority in the country. Ganesan said that they have been repeatedly demanding of President Wickremesinghe to talk about the political aspirations of the hill country Tamil community in his stated attempt to find solution to the National Question. He said the President is holding talks on finding ways to resolve the Tamil questions but the rest of the Tamil political parties ‘don’t represent’ the hill country Tamils of Indian origin. The TPA Leader said further, “We have been repeatedly demanding of President Wickremesinghe to conduct talks with us and all the Hill Country Tamil political parties, on the political aspirations of the Hill Country Tamil community in his stated attempt to find solutions to the national question. We have specifically told him to nominate a high-powered committee, chaired by him to look into this subject. “But, apart from certain remarks made from public stages, President Wickremesinghe has not done anything officially in this regard”, Ganesan added.  While welcoming the President’s talks, with the Tamil parties of the North and East, to find solutions to the political and accountability issues faced by the northern and eastern Tamil brethren, he said they also wanted all stakeholders to understand the political aspirations of the Hill Country Tamil community beyond the ‘Plantation’ radius. And the national question of Sri Lanka is not North and East centric but national.  It is because the discussion is all about the National Question, why did not the TPA, as a party in the opposition, question President Wickremasinghe’s mandate to conduct talks with minority parties to address the national question, Ganesan queried. “We consider the national question as the most important subject on the tray and no head of State needs any mandate to address this particular subject.  We have even exchanged such positive views with North and East Tamil parties. Hence, the attitude of President Wickremasinghe towards us is disappointing.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Also, attention paid to providing eggs to consumers at a fair price. The committee was of the view that the domestic poultry industry should be secured and the officials present agreed. It was revealed that domestic producers, representing the poultry industry, conveyed to the Committee that if the price of an egg can be kept at Rs 51 for a period of 1 ½ months until the poultry industry can be stabilised, the price of an egg can be reduced thereafter. The Committee was also of the view that whilst considering protecting the poultry industry, the respective authorities should also look at the context from the perspective of the consumer and act fairly by all parties. It was disclosed that there exists a temporary dearth of approximately three million eggs per day. The officials present stated that there is no precipitated process in the poultry industry as a solution to this.  Therefore, officials said that it has been agreed to import a limited number of eggs considering the consumer. Taking into consideration all factors presented before COPE, the Committee was of the view that all efforts must be made at a discussion to find a solution to the matter which is fair by the consumer. Accordingly, the Committee Chairman Prof. Ranjith Bandara instructed the respective officials to inform the public of the measures taken and to reassure that all parties are collectively working towards finding a practical solution to the matters of concern.

Advanced Level Examination – especially those in high risk areas to take precautions to prevent contracting the mosquito-borne disease while sitting for the examination.   National Organiser for the AHEOs Disnaka Dissanayake said yesterday (25),  the last 25 days of January this year had seen a total 7,115 dengue cases in the country.  A majority were reported from the Western Province, Kalmunai and Puttalam which have been identified as high risk areas.  He said the end of last year (2022) had seen a total of 76,688 dengue cases while in 2021 the total number had been 35,924.  “In comparison, the number of dengue cases had shown a sharp rise – more than two fold in 2022”, he said. The National Organiser said a comparatively high number of dengue cases at the beginning of this year indicates a possible risk of numbers exceeding those of last year. Dissanayake said Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Puttalam and Kalmunai had been identified as high risk areas.  “The public should be wary of the impending situation,” he said noting that students sitting the AL exam from these areas should pay close attention and take precautionary measures such as using a mosquito repellent when going to examination centres. He called for a systematic work plan to be prepared for dengue control by using entomology data. “New control methods should be used,” he said. The Entomology Officer said in addition, a systematic work plan should be made with survey data for dengue control. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Ceylon Today learns that the Moneragala District General Hospital was without a JMO for close to a year, while the Ministry’s failure to give the necessary posting to JMOs returning to the country after foreign training to the Ampara Hospital was preventing the Ampara JMO from taking up his post in Moneragala. The delay has jeopardised the services at the District General Hospital Moneragala.  Only when Ampara gets a replacement would the JMO be released. Until such time, services at the Moneragala District Hospital are crippled, hospital authorities lamented. Meanwhile, the Moneragala JMO had left the country for foreign training. Therefore, the Unit at the DGH Moneragala had only the services of two Medical Officers who were performing routine services. Sources said the Hospital and residents were in a quandary. It has resulted in patients and residents being inconvenienced.  They are unable to obtain special forensic reports or have post-mortems carried out by a Specialist JMO. Patients in need of JMO services and the dead have to be transferred to other hospitals that have a JMO. Therefore, Moneragala District General Hospital has to depend either on JMOs at the District General Hospital Ampara or Provincial General Hospital, Badulla. Several appeals had been made to the Health Ministry but to no avail, they alleged noting that even those JMOs returning after foreign training had used their influence to reverse them and get postings in Vavuniya and Nuwara Eliya, sources alleged.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

They are expected to meet the University Grant Commission (UGC) one more time on 27 January and decide the FUTA course of action for next week on the outcome with the UGC. If the Government does not resort to a reasonable tax deduction that lecturers could bear, the next step would be to join Bank unions, CEB Engineers Union and the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), to protest against the blunt deduction, former FUTA President Prof. Aruna Kumara said. According to FUTA, there is a 36 per cent tax deduction and several senior lecturers have taken a salary package of a mere Rs 14,000 after taxation. They also estimate tax deductions ranging from Rs 50,000 to Rs 125,000, and the Government has not considered Bank loans for housing, vehicles, and leasing that lecturers have taken. In this regard, General Secretary FUTA Rohan Laksiri stated that the income tax policy under the Inland Revenue Act introduced in Sri Lanka in January has greatly affected them. “As good citizens of the country we are not opposed to tax being spent for the development of the country. However, the tax policy introduced this month is unfair and unethical. Due to this, many members of our association have suffered beyond measure.” Meanwhile, FUTA proposed to the Government alternative schemes to the State tax policy. But they did not receive a response. “We have informed the UGC Chairman, the Chairman of the Council of Vice-Chancellors and Governors of the Universities of Sri Lanka in writing but no action has been forthcoming so far,” Prof. Kumara said. He added that they are forced to commence trade union action to get their legal rights and seek the Government’s attention on the tax issue. FUTA met on 24 January before deciding that FUTA will not participate in any meeting in the universities till further notice. He said there are four types of additional allowances added to the pay and the gross pay is being taxed. He said the Research and Development allowance, medical allowance, cost of living allowance and another special allowance have been calculated as part of the gross pay and taxed. “We have given our proposal and a mechanism that is justifiable for tax reduction but none of them have been considered. This huge deduction is absurd,” he added. “Probationary lecturers, senior professors, and associate professors are seeing a reduction between Rs 50,000 to Rs 125,000 in their salaries and this unbearable,” he said.  Meanwhile, a silent protest organised by the University Teachers’ Union of University of Sri Jayewardenepura was held opposite the university premises, against the new tax scheme.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

COPA Chairman Kabir Hashim questioned the need to spend more money to make the system operational. COPA pointed out that the Inland Revenue Department under the Ministry of Finance had launched the software system called RAMIS in 2014 to increase the efficiency of its tax revenue collection by investing about Rs 10 billion and information has been received that it is not functioning properly. The Auditor General said the Inland Revenue Department does not provide him with information about the service agreement and relevant payment details related to the above system. He further pointed out that the Inland Revenue Department refuses to provide particular information to the Auditor General according to the agreement, and that it is against the Constitution. Inland Revenue officials said there is a need to update this software system started in 2014 with the new Inland Revenue Act brought in 2017. They further pointed out that there is a problem in giving out the contractual information, according to the agreement with the Singaporean company that designed the above software system. Also, because it is a government to government agreement, the intervention of the Government will be appropriate for its future activities, IRD officials said. As there are issues in many areas of the RAMIS system, including procurement, COPA proposed to form two sub-committees to investigate the possibility of making this system operational in a way that will benefit the country. It is expected that the committee which is to be established jointly by the Attorney General’s Department under the leadership of the Finance Secretary will examine the legal conditions related to the RAMIS Agreement. The committee is to be established jointly with The University of Moratuwa, the Sri Lanka Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA), the Inland Revenue Department, and the Ministry of Finance to look into the possibility of updating the software system. It was also agreed to submit the reports containing the conclusions on the relevant matters to COPA within six weeks."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

Valence Mendis will raise to the Priesthood two Deacons, namely Rev. Deacon Janith Lakmal, S.J. and Rev. Deacon Chamika Nipun, S.J. Rev. Deacon Janith Lakmal, S.J. Mallawa Arachchige Don Janith Lakmal Perera, born on 4 March 1989, is the second child of Manel Jacintha Fernando and the late Annesley Shantha Perera of Talawila. Blessed with two brothers and a sister, Janith Lakmal grew up in the neighbourhood of St Anne’s shrine, Talawila. Inspired by his early association with this shrine of pilgrimage, he grew up with a passionate desire for religious activities. He received his primary education at St Anne’s Maha Vidyalaya, Talawila and secondary education at St Xavier’s College, Marawila The life journey of young Janith Lakmal took a decisive turn directed by the life stories of the Jesuits and especially that of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. Driven by the desire to serve as a Jesuit, in September 2008, he entered the Jesuit Pre-novitiate at Akkarapanaha, Negombo, where he received his initial religious formation. Having made up his mind to follow the Jesuit way, he entered the Jesuit Novitiate, ‘Daham Sihila’ at Dalugama, Kelaniya on 20 June 2009 and pronounced his first religious vows on 21 June 2011. In 2012, he began his degree studies in English Literature, Journalism and Economics at St. Aloysius University College in Mangalore, India and obtained his degree. He completed his post-graduation in Philosophy in ‘Satya Nilayam’ having obtained his MA degree from the University of Chennai, India. He then, returned to Sri Lanka and immersed himself in activities to gain experience working with people, a period known as Regency in Jesuit terminology.

As a growing up young man, he held in high honour his faith commitment and offered a good part of his precious time to parish activities, such as teaching religion to children and to other similar activities. He pursued his studies in Wesley College, Colombo. As he completed his studies at Wesley College and stood at the cross roads of life, to decide on a course of action, to face his future, he decided to offer himself to serve as a Jesuit. In order to pursue this newly discovered venture, he joined the Jesuit Pre-novitiate at Akkarapanaha, Negombo in September 2008 and discovered that the Lord, he longed to serve, was calling him to be a member of his company. Having discovered where his future should be, he entered the ‘Daham Sihila’ Jesuit Novitiate at Dalugama, Kelaniya and pronounced his first vows on 21 June 2011 committing himself to continue his chosen life as a Jesuit.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/01/25/trickle-down-economics-in-davos/,Trickle-Down Economics in Davos,Author not found,0,2023-01-24T20:30:00+00:00," The billionaires, bankers, politicians – and the high-price sex workers who cater to them – have gone home. The World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos is over for another year. More than 1,040 private jets flew in and out of airports serving the Swiss mountain resort during the week of the WEF, producing four times as much CO2 pollution from private jets in an average week. As the plutocrats and politicians flew home in luxury from their Swiss jaunt, they might have had time to cast a glance at a new report published to coincide with the gathering in Davos. Survival of the Richest, by Oxfam, makes enlightening reading. It shows that extreme wealth and extreme poverty have increased simultaneously for the first time in 25 years. “While ordinary people are making daily sacrifices on essentials like food, the super-rich have outdone even their wildest dreams. Just two years in, this decade is shaping up to be the best yet for billionaires – a roaring ‘20s boom for the world’s richest,” said Gabriela Bucher, Executive Director of Oxfam International. “It’s time we demolish the convenient myth that tax cuts for the richest result in their wealth somehow ‘trickling down’ to everyone else. Forty years of tax cuts for the super-rich have shown that a rising tide doesn’t lift all ships – just the superyachts.” Billionaires have seen extraordinary increases in their wealth. During the pandemic and cost-of-living crisis years since 2020, US$ 26 trillion (63 per cent) of all new wealth was captured by the richest ‘1 per cent’, while US$ 16 trillion (37 per cent) went to the rest of the world put together. A billionaire gained roughly US$ 1.7 million for every US$ 1 of new global wealth earned by a person in the bottom 90 per cent. Billionaire fortunes have increased by US$ 2.7 billion a day. Billionaire wealth surged in 2022 with rapidly rising food and energy profits. The report shows that 95 food and energy corporations have more than doubled their profits in 2022. They made US$ 306 billion in windfall profits and paid out US$ 257 billion (84 per cent) of that to rich shareholders. The Walton dynasty, which owns half of Walmart, received US$ 8.5 billion over the last year. Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, owner of major energy corporations, has seen this wealth soar by US$ 42 billion (46 per cent) in 2022 alone. Excess corporate profits have driven at least half of inflation in Australia, the US and the UK. At the same time, at least 1.7 billion workers now live in countries where inflation is outpacing wages, and over 820 million people are going hungry. Women and girls often eat least and last and makeup nearly 60 per cent of the world’s hungry population. The World Bank says we are likely seeing the biggest increase in global inequality and poverty since WW2. Entire countries are facing bankruptcy, with the poorest countries now spending four times more repaying debts to rich creditors than on healthcare. Three-quarters of the world’s governments, including Sri Lanka, are planning austerity-driven public sector spending cuts. Decades of tax cuts for the richest and corporations have fuelled inequality, with the poorest people in many countries paying higher tax rates than billionaires. But at least some trickle-down wealth is helping the sex workers who flocked to Davos. Nearly 3,000 conference delegates were in town for the five-day jamboree, the first in the post-pandemic era, said to provide a US$ 100 million boost to the local economy. Prostitution is legal in Switzerland, with sex workers expected to pay taxes. And trade was booming in Davos. Take Liana, who dresses in business attire so she doesn’t stand out among the executives. She told Bild she regularly sees an American who visits Switzerland multiple times a year and is among the WEF attendees. Liana charges around €700 (US$ 760) for an hour and €2,300 (US$ 2,500) for the whole night, plus travel expenses. The manager of one escort service in Aargau, 100 miles away from Davos, says she was flooded with bookings.

The entrepreneurial school gardens programme, implemented as part of a project funded by the Australian Government, totalling over USD 2.3 million, is aimed at improving the food and nutritional security of groups most affected by the ongoing economic crisis, particularly women and children. The programme features a discovery-based learning approach for over 100,000 secondary school students, from grades 8 – 12, where they will be educated on the capacity to transform their school gardens into sources of nutritious produce, that will facilitate diverse and healthy eating habits and encourage students to apply entrepreneurial thinking in agriculture. 505 school teachers from the three provinces were also trained on the discovery-based learning methodology as part of the programme to improve skills in food security, nutrition, agriculture and entrepreneurship. The Agriculture club in each school will be empowered to operate as a core programme partner that will oversee the coordination and navigation of the programme alongside school officials. It will also oversee the sale of harvests from the gardens and will be linked to sales points including private sector organisations, parents of students, local markets, or the national school meal programme via FAO, to ensure the harvests of the gardens generate an income – thereby ensuring the sustainability of the gardens beyond the project period. Australia’s High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Paul Stephens said, “School gardening has the potential to both improve children’s health and support learning. Involving students in school gardening and teaching them about the benefits of nutrition can have a lasting impact. This programme is helping to highlight the value of growing food for household food security.”  “We are appreciative of this generous assistance from the people of Australia, which has enabled this sustainable school-to-home knowledge transfer approach to strengthen food security among school children,” said FAO Representative in Sri Lanka, Vimlendra Sharan adding, “School gardens offer rich environments for children to engage in active learning. The knowledge will be transferred through students to their family members and by extension, to the communities, prompting an attitudinal change on food consumption habits and new agricultural concepts.” FAO will work closely with the Ministry of Education, Department of Agriculture, Ministry of Health and the Chief Secretariat of Uva, Central and Northern Provinces, to educate children and faculty on eco-friendly agricultural practices and nutrition.

Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe yesterday (23) accused Rambukwella and the Ministry officials for failing to take timely action in resolving a medicinal crisis which has been persisting for close to one year due to their inefficiency and feeble management skills. According to the Union’s discussions with the Treasury recently, the Health Ministry has findings which it can use to put an end to the medicinal drug issue. Dr. Wijesinghe lamented that there was no desired outcome despite funds from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Indian Credit Line being made available for it. There is no guarantee that the issue will be resolved by May this year despite the Health Minister’s public reassurance owing to the snail pace at which even the Indian Credit Line was being put to use. He lamented that the shortage of drugs in the State health service could lead to the death of some of its patients – especially from amongst those who suffer from chronic diseases. They receive drugs to last them only for two weeks due to the drug shortage while the price of medicinal drugs in the private sector was high, so patients only took the drugs that were given by their clinics. The GMOA Media Committee Member said with the increased charges in private sector hospitals, patients who used to take medicine from the private sector hospitals have also turned to the government service. Meanwhile, the GMOA commenced its Black Protest Week yesterday (23) from the National Hospital, Colombo with the signing of a petition against the drug shortage in the State health service and the new Inland Revenue Act.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts.

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

When they allocate 40 per cent for salaries, having electricity tariff increased by 80 per cent, water tariff increased by 40 per cent, their tax which was 14 per cent earlier increased to 30 per cent, what is left for a business?” “In 2019, Rs 19 billion was earned from PAYE tax while Rs 24 billion in 2020 and Rs 32 billion in 2021 were earned. Now it is estimated to be Rs 100 billion in 2023. If you know from the beginning that this is not achievable, there is no point in enforcing such a tax. If a white person comes and says to increase this from 10 to 25 per cent, our Government officials should have the courage to say that this cannot be done. “How much pressure does it put on an ordinary working person? Although his income has increased, his ability to pay or purchasing power has decreased rapidly due to inflation and taxes. “Therefore, I request the Government to please reconsider the PAYE tax.” This is not a practical tax, even though the whites say so. You can think about this afresh. Today, there are 14 million EPF tax files. If put Rs 250 per month in each of these files, you can earn Rs 42 billion in a year. Also, there are 3 million active tax files. If you get Rs 750 every month from a file, you can find Rs 27 billion in a year. There are 100,000 tax files of high level people who earn Rs 3-4 million monthly. If you impose a tax of Rs 75,000 a month, you will get Rs 90 billion in a year. When these things are added, you will get Rs 157 billion. There are 8 million in the private sector. They don’t get a cent from this tax. Does the public service contribute to the development of the country? I say these things because I have love for this country.” The former Finance Minister also said the proposals of the International Monetary Fund should be implemented only while safeguarding local values and insisted that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) should think creatively and find sources of income without pressuring the people. Karunanayake also blamed the Central Bank stating it lacks practical knowledge. “I find this as a major problem and point my finger at the Government also for watching silently. This crisis is not something that happened overnight.  We can only come out from this only by thinking differently when proceeding. These people are talking about an independent administration. Didn’t we go through 74 years of independent administration? Where has it gone now? Is the country bankrupt today because of the governments? No. The financial control is with the Central Bank.” He also alleged that today’s administration has in some way destroyed the creativity of Government officials. It is ridiculous to say that inflation will not be caused by devaluing the Rupee. Devaluing rupee is a proof of inflation, he added."

Dissanayake recently told a gathering in Maligawatte that the Government does not want to increase Treasury funds as it would compel the Government to hold an Election. As a result, they continue to deplete Treasury funds to continue staying in power, he said. “The Election costs only Rs 8 billion. The sugar tax scandal alone costs the country Rs 15 million. We could have held two Elections with this money. If you have brought this country to a point where even Elections cannot be held, you must leave,” Dissanayake said.

He said all commissions are subject to the President’s supervision, and that he, as Minister of Power and Energy, will request that the President take legal action against the PUCSL Chairman. He stressed that he hopes Ratnayake will set aside his political agenda in the coming days to avoid further jeopardising the country and putting the public in a precarious position. “The Government is the main victim of the Cabinet-proposed electricity tariff hike because the election is around the corner. Thus, the Government has no hidden agenda in increasing the electricity tariff.

In 2022, India provided USD 4.5 billion in assistance to Colombo to tide over its dire economic situation. While China is expected to hand over its letter of support to the IMF on Sunday, New Delhi handed over its support letter to IMF on 16 January, four days before External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar landed in Colombo to meet Sri Lanka’s political leadership on 20 January. During his meetings with Sri Lankan leaders including President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Jaishankar made it clear that India stands with its neighbour at a time of need and is prepared to go the extra mile if the need arises. The minister said his visit to Sri Lanka was a demonstration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Neighbourhood First Policy. In the letter of support to the IMF, addressed to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, India’s Finance Ministry acknowledged Sri Lanka’s deeply unsustainable debt situation, the country’s engagement with creditors to restore debt sustainability, and confirmed its strong support to Colombo’s prospective Extended Fund Facility supported programme. New Delhi has made it clear that it is committed to supporting Sri Lanka with financing/debt relief consistent with restoring that country’s public debt sustainability under the IMF supported programme and ensuring that the programme is fully financed as projected by the Bretton Woods Institution. The Modi Government has conveyed that this financing/debt relief will be provided by the Export Import Bank of India. Despite the fact that Sri Lanka’s economic crisis is partly due to white elephant infrastructure port and airport projects financed by high interest loans from Chinese banks, India has come out first in supporting Colombo, which is battling both economic and political turmoil. In its letter to the IMF, India has conveyed that it is committed to continuing negotiations with the Sri Lankan Government along with the Paris Club on a medium- to long-term debt restructuring through maturity extension and interest rate reduction or any other financial instrument that can deliver similar debt relief. The financing-cum-debt relief provided by Exim Bank of India will be consistent with restoring debt sustainability under the IMF supported programme. The Modi Government has been told that the IMF’s debt sustainability assessment will be underpinned by programme targets of reducing the ratio of Sri Lankan public debt to GDP to below 95 per cent by 2032 (from 130 per cent in 2022), the central government’s annual gross financing needs below 13 per cent of GDP on average in 2027-2032 period, and the Sri Lankan Government’s annual foreign currency debt service below 4.5 per cent of GDP in every year during the above time frame. The other target is to close the external financing gap of the island nation. India has made it clear to IMF that Sri Lankan authorities are expected to seek equitable debt treatment from all commercial creditors as well as official bilateral creditors, apart from adequate financing contributions from the multilateral development banks. Supporting IMF efforts on the above, India has conveyed its readiness to have in-depth talks with the Sri Lankan Government, IMF and the Paris Club so that debt relief and finances are finalised for the beleaguered island nation in coming weeks.

In doing so, we are not only safeguarding our economic rights and livelihoods, but also protecting the future of our students, who stand to be adversely affected by a sudden change in the evaluation process,” they said. Speaking further FUTA said therefore, they have instructed its members to withdraw their participation in the GCE Advanced Level 2023 Evaluation Process.  “While we are aware that this choice may raise serious concerns in the public, we are confident that the Government will be forced to see the light as a result of our awareness-raising and public agitation on the iniquitous and catastrophic tax law, revoking its worst provisions and revising on the basis of enlightened principles, so that we may take part in the examination and evaluation process without interruption. Moreover, even if the evaluation process were to be delayed, we are aware that no new students will be admitted to the state university system at present due to an acute lack of funding. Consequently, at this crucial juncture it is crucial that we keep up the fight for fair living standards for the populace and sufficient funding for our educational system,” he said."

The first step has been taken and we are meeting the party leaders again. We have made a lot of progress in the discussions.” Speaking further, the President noted that he want to have a discussion with the Muslim community about the problems they face. “What are the issues you (Muslim community) have gone through? A good example is the Digana riots in 2018. We have to talk about it and we have to talk about Easter Sunday attacks in 2019 as well. All those incidents are needed to be discussed and we have to talk about who and what created those situations. The issues that the Muslims in Colombo face are quite different from the issues that are faced by Muslims in the southeast of Sri Lanka, or the Mannar Muslims. So let us discuss those. There are so many issues. I think it is time for a genuine discussion,” he added. A commemorative stamp which was issued for the 100th anniversary of the ACJU was presented to the President along with a memento. Religious dignitaries, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, High Commissioners and Ambassadors, The President’s Chief of Staff and Senior Advisor to the President on National Security Sagala Ratnayake, Honorable Members of Parliament, Secretary of Ministry of Defence General Kamal Gunaratne (Retd), Chief of Defence Staff General Shavendra Silva and many other Opposition and ruling party politicians were present at the occasion.

They accused Dr. Bellana, who is also the President of the Government Medical Officers’ Forum (GMOF), of repeatedly accusing the Colombo NHSL minor employees of being addicted to marijuana and dangerous substances such as ice, claiming that they had even resorted to steal from patients coming to the hospital for treatment. The protesters had surrounded his office area, while some had surged into the hospital and the corridor outside his office, chanting slogans and surrounding it forcing him to remain within. Protesters demanded that disciplinary action be taken against the GMOF President. Minor employees alleged that Dr. Bellana was unable to fulfil his duty, as an administrator, to find solutions to the issue rather than going around giving voice cuts to the media and antagonise the staff.  However Dr. Bellana, when contacted, said that attendants had been offended by his revelation and that disciplinary action should be taken against them. Meanwhile, President of the Academy of Health Professionals (AHP), Ravi Kumudesh said that action should be taken to introduce a globally accepted method of testing for 16 types of dangerous substances. “We have written to the President, the Health Minister and the Minister of Law and Order requesting that like the breath analyser tests, this particular method of testing the urine for dangerous substances, be also introduced. It helps identify even the extent of the period during which the substance abuse has been taking place. This situation does not just prevail at the National Hospital and the Health Ministry but is there in every walk of life and it should be addressed with care, he said. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Secretary, in an affidavit submitted in connection with the Petition filed by Colonel (Retired), W.M.R. Wijesundara, seeking an order suspending the holding of the Local Government Elections in March 2023, said in 2022, average monthly expenditure on salaries, based on the Government cashflow, was around Rs 90 billion, monthly pensions and Samurdhi payments amounted to around Rs 28 billion and other recurrent expenditure, including medical supplies, fertiliser and others amounted to Rs 28 billion, totalling to Rs 145 billion per month. Compared to this, monthly Government revenue was Rs 163 billion based on the 2022 cashflow, he said adding that thereby on average, only Rs 18 billion per month was left from the revenue collection for all the expenses of the government. It was noted that there was other expenditure, including interest payments of around Rs 114 billion, capital expenditure of around Rs 31 billion and debt repayments of around Rs 169 billion per month in 2022. Consequently, there was an average cash deficit of aroundRs 296 billion per month. He added that since the country has been locked out of global capital markets since early 2020, the Government was unable to obtain foreign financing from the international markets to finance the cash deficit. It was also stated that it is only after IMF approves Sri Lanka’s contemplated EFF programme that the country will be able to access even limited foreign financing, adding that in the absence of foreign financing for the budget, the Government must manage its expenditure obligation through available tax and non-tax revenue and market borrowings which are very limited and expensive. Siriwardana noted that in such backdrop, expenditure for an election would add further pressure on an already stressed public finance system and noted that the Government is in the process of implementing a range of critical economic reforms, adding that if such move is disrupted at this stage, it could result in potentially disastrous consequences for the economic and social fabric of the country. He said long standing issues in the fiscal sector have been key factors behind the economic crisis adding that foreign financing options as well as domestic financing channels have also been exhausted. It was further noted that extreme care is necessary in deciding on the priority areas of expenditure, given the critical cashflow position and the need for managing mandatory and essential expenditure. It was also stated that any slippage would add to the already stressed fiscal position and would in turn burden the public. Siriwardana observed that the Government’s daily cashflow management has become extremely challenging in 2023 as well and even the regular payment of the public sector salaries on time has been challenging.

By the time the meeting started, there were 24 people present. They said “since 24 members were present for the meeting, it should have been held as there was a quorum.  They said after Emmanuel Arnold’s name was proposed for the post of mayor, in the absence of any other proposals,  Arnold was chosen as the Mayor.

An objection was immediately registered by us in the council as an unfair notification. However, ignoring our request, you adjourned the meeting and left the council hall,” they said in the letter. They further said that although the required quorum was present at the time of commencement of the meeting, as there was no other proposal for election, and no member raised any objection over the absence of quorum due to the withdrawal of four members, they had considered it appropriate to unanimously declare Emmanuel, as the Speaker of the Council as proposed.

NBRO, in its 2021 Annual Report, uploaded to the Parliament website on Tuesday, said that air quality dispersion model software was run to assess the ground level concentration of pollutants generated by the fire. “This modelling indicated that the contribution made by the X-Press Pearl fire increased the ambient pollutant levels resulting in the release of a total of between 8,000 to 13,000 metric tons of air pollutants to the atmosphere, depending on the amount of burnt mass caused, due to this incident. However, when the X-Press Pearl Disaster struck, Sri Lanka was in a Covid-19 lockdown scenario, said NBRO. As such the predicted levels of air pollution were well within the standard levels of pollution, since the ambient air pollutant levels during those days were very low due to the Covid-19 lockdown scenario, it added. Referring further to the X-Press Pearl disaster, NBRO, in their 2021 Annual Report, said that it conducted a comprehensive study on air quality in affected areas. “Once a ship is on fire, most of the chemicals and other materials stored in the vessel decompose and release smoke containing chemical vapour to the atmosphere, as ‘criteria air pollutants’ such as Carbon Monoxide are generated due to the combustion products depending on the composition of such materials.  Therefore, these fires may release hazardous pollutants such as dioxins, furans and other organic pollutants, heavy metals, and in addition, greenhouse gases such as Carbon Dioxide to the atmosphere depending on the nature of the burning materials and flame temperature. Released air pollutants then disperse into surrounding areas depending on the metrological conditions,” said NBRO. “As per the observations made during this particular fire, generated air pollutants dispersed as a plume to the inland areas when prevailing wind was from the West and South-West. The results of measurements taken indicated high pollution levels in areas close to the ship whereas significant levels were not recorded in other areas identified earlier as critical. The continuous monitoring data indicated that some peak pollution levels exceeding national standard levels existed only for a few hours with and due to the changing meteorological conditions,” it added.

The Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), in a statement emphasised that “a law that seeks to regulate election campaign financing should prevent undue influence of donors over candidates, parties and independent groups, create a level playing field for all candidates including new entrants and underrepresented groups and reduce excessive and illegal spending on elections including by means such as the misuse of public funds and vote-buying. “To be effective, the law should also provide for a robust monitoring and enforcement mechanism by both the authorities and citizens.  “However, the Bill that was gazetted on 29 November 2022, is woefully inadequate to serve these purposes. The Bill bans campaign contributions from certain parties such as foreign governments, corporate bodies registered outside Sri Lanka, companies with foreign shareholding and anonymous donors. However, it does not impose any limit on how much funding a candidate, party or independent group can receive from any source, allowing space for undue influence,” the statement said. “Furthermore, the Bill foresees the designation of an authorised amount as the spending limit for a candidate at each election, which amount has not been considered with sufficient detail. It also does not set out an adequate monitoring mechanism. It does not prevent spending by political parties and third parties, on candidates. As such, the proposed spending limit will only defeat the purpose of introducing this law.  “The proposed procedure to enforce spending limits is also inadequate. The Bill only provides that candidates should submit audited accounts to the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL), who will notify the public of their availability for perusal. An effective law would require maintenance and disclosure of all accounts of candidates, parties or independent groups to the ECSL, and would also make such information digitally accessible to the public, enabling easy scrutiny, and an opportunity to digitally identify irregularities.” While re-emphasising the critical need for election campaign finances regulation in Sri Lanka, the collective of election monitoring organisations called upon the government to close the aforementioned loopholes in the Bill and to engage in a consultative process with the public, without rushing its passage in Parliament. “A weak regulatory system can lead to a further deterioration of people’s trust in politics and the legitimacy of the electoral process, and will not achieve the objectives of introducing such a law,” they said.  The collective further reiterated that the introduction of a campaign financing law should in no instance be used as a reason to delay the holding of the LG election."

The country is facing its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948, and policymakers have been grappling with multiple challenges over the past year including a shortage of dollars, runaway inflation and a steep recession. “India has written to the IMF,” the source told Reuters, asking not to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media. A spokesperson for India’s Finance Ministry declined to comment. Sri Lanka’s Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sri Lanka requires the backing of China and India – its biggest bilateral lenders – to reach a final agreement with the IMF on the USD 2.9 billion loan that is essential to put its battered economy back on track. “We are working to get our economy onto the right path,” President Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament on Tuesday. “We now have to get India and China’s agreement on debt restructuring. These discussions are continuing and so far they have been successful.” The two Asian giants, which have jostled for influence over Sri Lanka for decades, are also the island nation’s biggest trading partners, accounting for about USD 5 billion each in bilateral trade in 2021. Sri Lanka owes India around USD 1 billion that will come under the debt restructuring plan, the source said. New Delhi separately provided Sri Lanka with about USD 4 billion in rapid assistance between January and July last year, including credit lines, a currency swap arrangement and deferred import payments. Sri Lanka owed Chinese lenders USD 7.4 billion – nearly a fifth of its public external debt – by the end of last year, according to calculations by the China Africa Research Initiative (CARI). Japan is Sri Lanka’s third significant bilateral lender, and Colombo needs prior financing agreements with all three countries to seek IMF board approval for a four-year programme with the lender. “We are hopeful of finalising support from the IMF in the first quarter of 2023,” Sri Lanka’s cabinet spokesperson, Bandula Gunawardana, told reporters on Tuesday. Sri Lanka has to secure prior financing assurances from creditors, put its heavy debt burden on a sustainable path and increase public revenue before the global lender will disburse the funds, the IMF has said. The IMF has stressed the importance of joint talks involving three of Sri Lanka’s main bilateral creditors – China, Japan and India. Sri Lanka’s cabinet said on Tuesday that it would cut its recurrent budget expenditure by 6% in 2023 and had approved a proposal to delay salaries of some public employees to manage public finances.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Who is keeping printing US dollars with more than USD 3 trillion in 2020 alone and who are those private creditors owning 40 per cent of Sri Lanka’s total external debt stock with the highest interest rates and who sued Sri Lanka in its Federal Court immediately after the Island’s default?

The BBC highlighted that Chinese loans stand at USD 7 billion while Indian loans stand at USD 1 billion.

Beijing also questioned the US as to what are the political preconditions of US Aid while being assured by China’s ‘no strings attached’ commitment and practice.  The Dragons further noted that it was hypocrisy at its finest for the US Colleague to play the blame game instead of self-examination. “Why didn’t the US take decisive actions in the IMF for a more comfortable solution for Sri Lanka or extend a grant to the island with the rocket amount of USD dollars they print every year, instead of sowing discord between China and Sri Lanka.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

CEB statistics showed that Sri Lanka consumed a total of 37.10 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity on Tuesday. CEB’s average tariff rate of Rs 29.14 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which the above calculations are based on, are as per Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera’s recent statement, coupled with CEB’s tariff costs found in Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL’s) 2021 Annual Report, which is the latest of such data available in the public domain. Wijesekera was not contactable to find out CEB’s latest generation cost/s and transmission and distribution losses data, respectively. In related developments, the Cabinet’s last Monday’s (9 January) decision to hike electricity tariffs further by an undisclosed percentage with retrospective effect from 1 January is also not taken into consideration, because, ipso facto, such details are unknown. Meanwhile, according to CBSL, CEB’s average tariff rate in 2021 was Rs 16.37 per electricity unit (one kWh of electricity energy), a 78.01 per cent (Rs 12.77) hike since. An 8.72 per cent transmission and distribution loss as per 2021 cost estimates as computed by the CEB is also taken into consideration in the above computation. In like developments, the breakdown of the 37.10 GWh of electricity generated on Tuesday comprised 12.97 GWh of CEB coal, 11.79 GWh of CEB hydroelectricity, 7.736 GWh of CEB fuel/thermal oil, 5.97 GWh from renewable energy (RE) other than CEB hydroelectricity and 2.18 GWh from independent power producers’ (IPP) private sector (PS) fuel oil, respectively. According to the CBSL, the cheapest electricity generation cost to the CEB in 2021 was CEB hydroelectricity at Rs 1.67 a unit of electricity, followed by CEB coal (Rs 10.68), ‘other RE’ (Rs 16.22), IPP/ PS fuel oil (Rs 30.35) and CEB fuel oil (Rs 32.03), respectively.  The main driver of CEB hydroelectricity is the Mahaweli which generated 7.16 GWh of electricity on Tuesday and which contributed to 17.62 per cent of total electricity generation and 60.73 per cent of total CEB hydroelectricity generation on that day. Mahaweli is led by Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe and Kotmale built during the J.R. Jayewardene era after obtaining both grant and concessional aid from the West. On Tuesday, cheap and clean RE such as electricity generated by the Mahaweli provided 43.70 per cent (17.76 GWh) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity needs via the CEB, while the balance 56.30 per cent (22.88 GWh) of electricity generated was from the dirty and imported fossil fuels consisting of coal and fuel oil, respectively.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/01/18/country-will-return-to-long-queues-dr-weerasinghe/,COUNTRY WILL RETURN TO LONG QUEUES – DR. WEERASINGHE,Author not found,0,2023-01-17T21:00:00+00:00,"The country returning to long queues that prevailed for more than six months last year is inevitable if the existing economic mechanism is interrupted or disturbed in any way, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe warned yesterday (17). Responding to questions posed by journalists during a televised discussion Rata kothanada? (Where does the country stand?) on the country’s economic and financial situation aired by all TV channels last night, Dr. Weerasinghe emphasised the need to bring in foreign exchange in some way. “If the country gets enough foreign exchange, the economy will be stable. So far, what we have done is manage the limited amount of foreign exchange and spend it only on essential items. “The primary requirement now is how to manage the amount of foreign exchange required to fulfil basic needs. So far, we have been able to manage it without obtaining any additional foreign loans.” Fielding further questions, the CBSL Governor said: “When I assumed the post of Central Bank Governor, the economy of this country had collapsed. The Treasury was at great risk. Even then, we saw that if the economy had continued as it is, the country was heading for a big economic crisis. At that time, our effort was to address the situation in some way without taking such a risk. In short, an economy heading towards inevitable collapse is now stabilising. However, people are still experiencing the effects of the economic crisis. It is because the economy contracted that there were some difficulties. A recent contraction of negative 7.5 means that economic activity is 7.5 per cent lower than the last year and inflation is high. Accordingly, it is evident that the economy has contracted and there has been some impact on the economy. Yet, despite some contraction, the economy that was heading towards collapse has now been stabilised. One of the main reasons for economic contraction is the lack of foreign exchange in the country. The economy began contracting by a negative 1.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2022. Thereafter, the situation continued to worsen, but now it has reached a stable level. The best example is to look at the economy’s contraction for the first time in history before Covid in 2001. You might remember that it was from minus 1.5. There was a similar crisis then, especially, the foreign exchange deficit. At that time, the economy was stabilised by obtaining foreign exchange assistance from the International Monetary Fund. When there was no economic system in the country, for example, there were huge fuel and gas queues from March to July. If that situation continued, the country’s economy would have crashed. That would have created a situation where no one would have been able to engage in any local industry or export.” Meanwhile, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe, expressing views during the same programme, said it would be possible to obtain the approval of the Executive Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund before the end of the first quarter of this year. Further, due to the assurance that Sri Lanka will follow a globally acceptable financial policy with other countries, the State Minister also pointed out that the possibility exists for obtaining other bilateral and multilateral loans and money. In response to a question raised by a journalist regarding the financial assistance proposed to be received from the International Monetary Fund, the State Minister said: “Small groups who do not understand the intervention of the International Monetary Fund are talking about the USD 2.9 billion received over four years from this extended loan amount. But this matter does not stop there. So far, many of the groups that are talking about this are groups that have not contributed to the programme carried out by the Government and the programme carried out by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance.  Similarly, some groups believe that the foreign exchange crisis in the country should be resolved, but there are a handful who say that the people should be allowed to suffer in this manner without resolving it. No one can go against the decisions taken by the Government regarding the International Monetary Fund. I saw different groups, different institutions, and different people expressing their personal opinion on this matter. However, now we have reached the final stage. There is a division in the Government regarding whether or not to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund. One group said they should get the support of the International Monetary Fund, while another group discussed the management of the country’s economy through a local mechanism without seeking the support of the IMF. However, by March 2022, the Government decided to seek the assistance of the International Monetary Fund and get their Extended Fund Facility to find the necessary solutions to the crisis in the country. Based on the situation we are in today, loan repayment has been suspended. We are known as a country that cannot repay debts. Therefore, we must achieve debt sustainability. The intervention of the International Monetary Fund is very important in this situation. If we look at the USD 2.9 billion, this is between USD 4-5 billion. It is not only the International Monetary Fund that intervenes here. With the confidence we get, in the guarantee that is given, based on the assurance that the necessary reforms will be carried out in the country and we follow a financial policy that is acceptable to other countries globally, we will have the ability to get other bilateral and multilateral dues and possible funds. Notably, the IMF is gaining confidence in Sri Lanka. Today’s rating agencies have rated the economy at a very low level. As a result, we are unable to obtain more funds and get financial support. That is why the President said if we look at the past 7-8 months, no institution or country has provided any kind of financial support to Sri Lanka apart from urgent humanitarian assistance. We are managing our foreign exchange locally on the policies adopted by the Treasury. The rating agencies will consider the country’s economic situation more positively based on the confidence in us internationally. Similarly, when implementing our financial policies, we look positively at the method of implementing these policies. Hence, the International Monetary Fund certification is very important for us to achieve debt sustainability. The IMF’s assurance is very important for us to achieve debt sustainability. Therefore, we have discussed this with all bilateral creditors. Three rounds of negotiations have been held and we hope that we will be able to get the approval of the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund before the end of this quarter after receiving the necessary financial certifications. Therefore, the country’s economic stability that we have experienced so far to some extent is not the complete stability that the Government is hoping for. We all should pay attention to this situation while we work. I believe that where the Parliament is considered, the ruling party members as well as the other members too have the same responsibility. Hence, when expressing their views, it is very important to express their opinions in a manner that does not interfere with this positive programme because all citizens get the dividends of these programmes. Similarly, if the country cannot be stabilized, everyone will have to face the repercussions. Therefore, if any group interrupts the approval process of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilise the economy of the country, the economic situation in the country would become more serious than the situation in March 2022, and it would require a comparatively longer period to recover. Therefore, no one should underestimate this programme and its benefits should not be limited just to USD 2.9 billion. By now, related countries and institutions have commenced discussions with us with their assurance to extend financial support as well as other support to us. Therefore, we believe that with the assurance we receive at the end of the first quarter, we would be able to bring our economy to the expected level of stability by the end of this year.”  Responding to a journalist, who queried if it wasn’t the public who will have to bear the financial burden of an election, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said during the last two years a massive movement created by democracy was shattered due to economic issues. “The President, who was elected with 6.9 million votes, had to resign due to the struggle of the people who could not bear the economic pressure. As a result, the Cabinet was rendered inactive. If the struggle had continued, the Parliament would have been inoperative. We still have the problem of whether this is a suitable year for an election. We are still in an economic crisis where some sectors are still in decline. In some sectors, the decline of the economy is slowing down. Under such a situation, should we go for a so-called democratic election soon? It has been estimated that Rs 12 billion would be spent on the election. At present, the expenditure of the country has increased to 300 if the income is 100. We have had to find the deficit by way of loans or printing money. If the election is held, the inflation rate would rise. If the funds for an election were taken out of the tax revenue, it would affect the poor. In such a situation, if we find the money for a Local Government Election by printing money, it will be a world record. Democracy is important and I am saying it as a representative of the Treasury. But, I ask the public if this is the right time for an election. This is a time when the country’s democracy is being turned upside down by the country’s economic issues.” Another journalist asked Finance Ministry Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana about the budgetary allocation on the Local Government Election and the financial capability of the Treasury to pay the salaries of public employees and pensions and grant subsidies in the future. Siriwardana responded: “In general, we have problems in day-to-day financial management. Essential payments such as government employee salaries, pensions and subsidies have to be made. We have to proceed with those payments. Rs 3 billion is required to pay government employee salaries while Rs 27.5 billion is needed for pensions. The Government has to bear Rs 11 billion for other allowances. Rs 10 billion is spent monthly on medicines alone. In such a situation, only Rs 10 billion would be spared from the income and hence we are in the grips of an economic crisis. The amount we get from foreign loans is very limited. During 2020 and 2022, there has been an outflow of foreign currency from the country. If the interest rate in the banking system remains high, it is difficult for the public to carry out their daily activities. In addition, the country is experiencing a USD crisis. Rs 3 billion should be given to the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation or there would be a shortage of medicine in the country.”"

In response to a question raised by Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the PM said the Cabinet did not take such a decision last week and if someone claims so, it is completely false. Dissanayake said it was the Cabinet Secretary who informed both the Election Commission and the Public Administration Ministry Secretary. “If what the PM says is true, someone like the Cabinet Secretary spreading such false claims is very serious situation,” Dissanayake pointed out. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, who also joined the discussion, said Gunawardena also should take the responsibility for the chaos created after Hapuninna’s controversial letter. Gunawardena then said, as the Public Administration Minister, he never instructed to send such a directive. “The Secretary withdrew the letter on the same day.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/01/18/china-strongly-opposes-dalai-lamas-planned-visit-to-sl/,China strongly opposes Dalai Lama’s planned visit to SL,Author not found,0,2023-01-17T20:50:00+00:00," In the wake of a group of high-ranking Sri Lankan Buddhist Monks, who were on a pilgrimage to Bodh Gaya recently, seeking His Holiness Dalai Lama’s visit to Sri Lanka, Chinese Embassy Chargé d’affaires Hu Wei visited Kandy recently and called on the Mahanayake Thera of the Malwathu Chapter, Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera to stress that the Government and people of China including in the Tibet Autonomous Region strongly oppose any foreign country to receive the Dalai Lama in any name. The Chinese Envoy claimed that the 14th Dalai Lama is absolutely not a “simple monk” as he self-claimed, but the head of the feudal serfdom and the theocracy in Tibet prior to 1951 and a political exile disguised as a religious figure that has long been engaging in anti-China separatist activities and attempting to split Tibet from China. The Embassy said at the visit on 11 January, Wei had a friendly conversation about the millennia-close exchanges between the two peoples and Buddhist communities of the two countries, as well as China’s firm support to all walks of life in Sri Lanka to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis. The issue of the 14th Dalai Lama’s intention to visit Sri Lanka was also discussed The Embassy added that by smashing the lies of the Dalai Lama group; the Chinese Chargé d’affaires briefed the Mahanayake Thera that in the Dalai Lama era, about 1 million people were serfs accounting for 95 per cent of Tibet’s population. Its GDP was only 129 million RMB and the Life Expectancy was only 35.5 years (in 1951). Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Tibetan people are now enjoying a prosperous economy with a GDP of RMB 210 billion (31 billion USD) and the GDP per capita of USD 8,000 (twice of Sri Lanka and 4 times of India where he resides now), the longevity of 72.19 years on average and freedom of religion with 46,000 monks and nuns in over 1,700 temples in Tibet. According to Indian news agency ANI, Waskaduwe Mahindawansa Mahanayaka Thera, Sri Sambuddha Sasanodaya Sangha Sabha stated in an interview, “India helped His Holiness Dalai Lama, and today we know thousands of tourists are at Bodh Gaya because of His Holiness.” “These days, Bodh Gaya is really cold, and people typically don’t come, but they come because of His Holiness,” he added. “Bodh Gaya benefits in a variety of ways. Is Tibet gaining anything? We should ponder about this part also.” The high-ranking monk wished the Dalai Lama would visit Sri Lanka and assist in overcoming the country’s present economic difficulties. “As His Holiness has been to Bodh Gaya, I believe. If he visits Sri Lanka, tens of thousands of tourists will visit, boosting the economy because we are in a slump. And, if His Holiness visits Sri Lanka, many tourists will flock here, as they did to Bodh Gaya. We will be blessed, and the economy will benefit as well,” he explained. The meeting with the Dalai Lama apparently impressed Makulewe Wimala Mahanayaka Thera, Mahanayaka Thera of Ramanna Maha Nikaya, who said “We were delighted to meet His Holiness the Dalai Lama, a spiritual leader. We have a grasp on spiritual activity. As a result, Mahasangha from Sri Lanka is pleased to witness what His Holiness is accomplishing.” Ven. Muruddeniya Dhammarathana Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter further said they are overjoyed because Bodh Gaya is like our motherland because Lord Buddha attained enlightenment there and they love that location.  However, We emphasised that China and Sri Lanka have been firmly supporting each other on issues concerning each other’s core interests, including the Tibet-related issue. Both sides, especially the Buddhist communities, must prevent a sneaky visit of the Dalai Lama to the island to promote “Tibetan independence” and safeguard the China-Sri Lanka historical relations from being damaged. The Chinese Embassy said Most Venerable Malwathu Mahanayaka Thera highly appraised the close friendship between Sri Lanka and China dating from Ven. Faxian Thera’s visit the island 1,600 years ago, and Chinas continued support to Sri Lanka since the latter’s independence, particularly during former PM Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s time. In the last three years of fighting against the Covid-19 and economic crisis, China has been assisting us greatly with PPEs, vaccines, rice, diesel etc., which is fully appreciated by the Sri Lanka people including the Maha Sangha.

Speaking in Parliament yesterday (17), the President said he understands that there is criticism against Independence Day celebrations. “We have planned a programme to provide two million low-income families with 10 kg of rice per month during March and April. I would be happier if we could give them more. As we celebrate our 75th Independence Day, we will not allow our people to starve. We will invest the funds required to feed them. Some people criticise the expenditure of the Government on the independence celebration. But, we need to provide such relief to the people,” he said. He also said Sri Lanka will have to spend another Rs 10 billion within the next few years for the 25-year development plan. “It has been 75 years since we gained independence and we are taking measures to create several institutions by the time we reach our 100th year of independence to bring about the required reforms in the country. Thus, we are working to establish an institution to study about the history of the country. One of the biggest accusations against us is that we have forgotten our history. We are establishing an economic and trade institution similar to those in many different countries. In addition, for the first time in our country, we are setting up an institution for women and gender. Measures will also be taken to establish a university for training the officials on Government and State Policies. We should establish an agricultural technology university if we need our agriculture to be modernised. We also plan to establish a University on Climate Change to which foreign countries have already expressed their willingness to assist. We also hope to establish a sports university to train this country’s athletes to international standards. We need funds for these activities. These may cost more than Rs 10 billion. We do not spend money at once on these projects. Our 75th independence celebration does not end there. We are implementing these programmes for the future,” he said. Speaking further, the President said the Government plans to pass several new laws; National Commission for Women Act, the Gender Equality Act, and the Women’s Empowerment Act. “When these three acts are passed, ours will become the country in South Asia that has taken the highest measures for the safety of women. We would also pass the Climate Change Act, Forest Replantation and Tree Cover Act etc. In addition, with the passage of the Living Entity Act, we would get the rightful ownership of the Mahaweli River, Sinharaja Forest, Sri Pada Site, Horton Plains, Knuckles and Adam’s Bridge etc. The country would become one with the best environmental laws in the region with the passage of the laws for marine resources exploration and management and the Muthurajawela (Conservation) Act,” he said. Moreover, he said a Social Justice Commission Act will be introduced as well. “In addition to these programmes, allocations should be made to establish 75 urban forests this year and the National Youth Platform project programmes. We will also take measures to implement a 1,996 housing project for low-income families in Colombo and Gampaha Districts. Despite the present economic crisis in the country, we are working hard to provide relief to the people. On this 75th independence anniversary, I propose to the Opposition to change the existing political system. Let’s work together to provide relief to the people. If we could achieve such progress with these limited resources, I urge everyone to work together for the future of the country,” the President said.  By Methmalie Dissanayake and Aloka Kasturiarachchi"

Galwewa Siridhamma Thera was taken up for the first time before Colombo Additional Magistrate Mahawatta yesterday and Senior Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appeared for Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam. The two suspects Mudalige and the IUBF Convener, Ven. Galwewa Siridhamma Thera, were produced at the official chamber of the Colombo Chief Magistrate on 17 and 22 November, last year. When it was convened at the two aforementioned dates, SDSG Peiris stated that four officers attached to the TID, had submitted affidavits to the IGP, related to statements delivered by the Additional Magistrate and pertaining to her actions. He pointed out that as per the affidavits submitted to the IGP, the latter had made a request, to hand over the complaints against the Additional Magistrate, to the JSC. The SDSG mentioned that as per the affidavits submitted, after the suspects had been produced at the official chamber of the Chief Magistrate, the Additional Magistrate had maintained that as per the Provisions of the PTA, the suspects cannot be enlarged on bail. SDSG Peiris stated that the Additional Magistrate had claimed, as her hands were tied due to Provisions contained in the PTA, that she had advised officials to facilitate Ayurveda medicine for the suspect monk and provide him with a certain milk powder brand. According to SDSG Peiris, the Additional Magistrate had sent Rs 10,000 via a Court Officer, to be given to the suspect monk. At that stage, the Additional Magistrate advised the prosecution, to submit the affidavits filed by the Police Officers. SDSG Peiris then insisted that it would be prejudicial to the trial, if it were to be called before the Additional Magistrate concerned and urged the Court, to transfer it to be heard before the Colombo Chief Magistrate. Thereafter Saliya Pieris, PC, representing the defence, strongly opposed the request made by the prosecution. He added that if the AG wishes a trial to be transferred from one Court to another, then it should be carried out as per Provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. He remarked that the actions of the prosecution would not bode well for the judicial community in this country. Saliya Pieris explained that the prosecution’s actions could also be best described, as an attempt made to intimidate the Judiciary and also as an affront to it. Addressing the Court thereafter, Additional Magistrate Mahawatta noted that though she had made certain remarks directed at the suspect monk purely on humanitarian grounds, all comments she had made on that date had been uttered in front of TID officers. However, she maintained that the TID officers had in their affidavits, included remarks which had not been uttered by her, on that date. She said it was obvious to her that certain people had attempted to create a rift between her and the Police and that she would not condone such actions. Thereafter, Additional Magistrate and Defence Counsel Saliya Pieris, inquired from the prosecution, whether any complaints had been lodged before the Judicial Services Commission (JSC), related to the affidavits. Responding, SDSG Dileepa Peiris observed that the Attorney General’s Department was looking to submit the complaints concerning the affidavits, to the JSC shortly. Considering the submissions, Additional Magistrate Tharanga Mahawatta, ordered future trial proceedings, to be convened before Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis. Thus, the trial was convened before the said Chief Magistrate and at the outset, Defence Counsel Saliya Pieris, PC urged the Court to issue an order for his client to be enlarged on bail. The Court then ordered both the prosecution and the defence, to file written submissions pertaining to the trial on 24 January and ordered the suspect IUSF Convener, to be further remanded till 31 January.  Following this, Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis stated that his decision on whether to enlarge Mudalige on bail or not, will be delivered on 31 January.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/01/18/electricity-tariff-hike-unlawful-ratnayake/,Electricity tariff hike ‘unlawful’ – Ratnayake,Author not found,0,2023-01-17T20:50:00+00:00,"If the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) does any tariff revision, it would be a violation of Section 30 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act as it has failed to implement steps instructed by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) 10 years ago to determine ‘reasonable cost’ related to tariff changes, the PUCSL said. As a result of CEB’s failure to implement those proposals, calculating reasonable cost to pass to consumer in the recent tariff hike is impossible. Therefore, if the CEB increases the electricity tariff, it would be a violation of Section 30 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act. PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake in a letter to Cabinet Secretary W.M.D.J. Fernando with regard to the recent proposal to raise electricity tariffs in 2023 said the CEB was instructed to perform the five conditions since 2013 to determine the reasonableness of cost reflective tariff. Those conditions were establishment of Bulk Supply Transactions Account, execution of Power Purchase Agreements between CEB Generation plants and Transmission Licensee, execution of Power Sales Agreements between Transmission Licensee and Distribution Licensees, transparency in Merit Order Dispatch and independent dispatch audit and long-term fuel supply agreements. Ratnayake said the consumer tariff determining methodology is possible under the tariff methodology and a cost reflective tariff is a legal requirement under Section 30 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, which the Commission has to adhere to. However, the Act only allows passing reasonable costs to the consumers. He said in the letter that the determination of the reasonableness of the costs is a function of the Commission under Section 30 of the Act, and in this regard, the Commission has directed CEB to perform the following conditions since 2013 to determine the reasonableness of costs. “However, CEB has not taken action for 10 long years to adhere those requirements and it is impossible to judge the reasonableness of the costs submitted by the CEB. Therefore, CEB shall complete these requirements before any tariff revision. Otherwise, it is a violation of the law as well as it is grossly unfair by the consumer,” it said. Therefore, the PUCSL has directed the CEB to complete these requirements before any tariff revision, citing otherwise, it is a violation of the law as well as it is grossly unfair by the consumer."

Accordingly, the monthly salaries of executive officers in the State sector will be paid after some days from the exact salary date. It was revealed that this was due to the implementation of new revenue proposals of the government that is now underway for the year 2023 and since a considerable time would be needed for collecting the income generated from that, government expenditure has to be managed for the next few months from January to cater to the government’s financial inflow."

Bloomberg reported yesterday (17) that India formally notified that it would support Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring plan and also quoted President Ranil Wickremesinghe as saying that Sri Lanka’s debt negotiations with China and India are “successful.” The three major donor countries, China, Japan, and India, were requested to restructure their loans, a pre-condition tabled by the IMF to obtain the bailout package. India’s support for Sri Lanka’s IMF facility comes as India’s Minister of External Affairs, Dr. S. Jaishankar, plans to visit Sri Lanka on 19 January, where he will meet stakeholders and discuss debt restructuring. Last week, President Wickremesinghe endorsed his visit. Japan said some months ago that it will proceed with other development projects, but that Sri Lanka must first obtain an IMF loan. Japan stated in August that it is critical for the Sri Lankan Government to collaborate with the IMF and the Paris Club to improve the country’s economic and financial position while maintaining openness. Japan also stated that it will continue to think about how to respond to this scenario while keeping a careful eye on such trends and the situation in Sri Lanka, as well as talking with Sri Lanka and other donors and international organisations. China’s Communist Party (CPC) Vice Minister and Head of the CPC International Department Chen Zhou, who was in Sri Lanka a few days ago, told Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, “Sri Lanka is a very special friend of China, and we are considering how we could assist Sri Lanka to get over the current crisis,” and he had assured the Prime Minister, “You will have some good news soon.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Making a statement in the House, Sirisena blamed the officials under him, at that time, for not carrying out their responsibilities properly and said he is being penalised for others’ crimes. “Some claim I was fined by the Supreme Court. But this is not a fine, but compensation. I only have to pay this because the officials who were under my purview, at that time, did not carry out their responsibilities properly, not because of a fault of mine,” he claimed. However, since he is economically incapable of paying Rs. 100 million he will seek assistance from his friends and well-wishers and somehow compensate the victims, he added. Speaking further, Sirisena said the Supreme Court verdict clearly stated that he, as the then President, had not been informed about the intelligence information on the Easter Attacks by the responsible officials. The SC also observed that the President should take the responsibility for any offences committed by any official appointed by him and that he had to pay compensation only on that basis, he claimed.

Dissanayake said it was the Cabinet Secretary who informed both the Election Commission and the Public Administration Ministry Secretary. “If what the PM says is true, someone like the Cabinet Secretary spreading such false claims is very serious situation,” Dissanayake pointed out. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, who also joined the discussion, said Gunawardena also should take the responsibility for the chaos created after Hapuninna’s controversial letter. Gunawardena then said, as the Public Administration Minister, he never instructed to send such a directive. “The Secretary withdrew the letter on the same day. There are instances in the past where ministry secretaries sent letters and withdrew them on the same day,” he added. BY Methmalie Dissanayake and Aloka Kasturiarachchi"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/01/18/china-strongly-opposes-dalai-lamas-planned-visit-to-sl/,China strongly opposes Dalai Lama’s planned visit to SL,Author not found,0,2023-01-17T20:50:00+00:00," In the wake of a group of high-ranking Sri Lankan Buddhist Monks, who were on a pilgrimage to Bodh Gaya recently, seeking His Holiness Dalai Lama’s visit to Sri Lanka, Chinese Embassy Chargé d’affaires Hu Wei visited Kandy recently and called on the Mahanayake Thera of the Malwathu Chapter, Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera to stress that the Government and people of China including in the Tibet Autonomous Region strongly oppose any foreign country to receive the Dalai Lama in any name. The Chinese Envoy claimed that the 14th Dalai Lama is absolutely not a “simple monk” as he self-claimed, but the head of the feudal serfdom and the theocracy in Tibet prior to 1951 and a political exile disguised as a religious figure that has long been engaging in anti-China separatist activities and attempting to split Tibet from China. The Embassy said at the visit on 11 January, Wei had a friendly conversation about the millennia-close exchanges between the two peoples and Buddhist communities of the two countries, as well as China’s firm support to all walks of life in Sri Lanka to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis. The issue of the 14th Dalai Lama’s intention to visit Sri Lanka was also discussed The Embassy added that by smashing the lies of the Dalai Lama group; the Chinese Chargé d’affaires briefed the Mahanayake Thera that in the Dalai Lama era, about 1 million people were serfs accounting for 95 per cent of Tibet’s population. Its GDP was only 129 million RMB and the Life Expectancy was only 35.5 years (in 1951). Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Tibetan people are now enjoying a prosperous economy with a GDP of RMB 210 billion (31 billion USD) and the GDP per capita of USD 8,000 (twice of Sri Lanka and 4 times of India where he resides now), the longevity of 72.19 years on average and freedom of religion with 46,000 monks and nuns in over 1,700 temples in Tibet. According to Indian news agency ANI, Waskaduwe Mahindawansa Mahanayaka Thera, Sri Sambuddha Sasanodaya Sangha Sabha stated in an interview, “India helped His Holiness Dalai Lama, and today we know thousands of tourists are at Bodh Gaya because of His Holiness.” “These days, Bodh Gaya is really cold, and people typically don’t come, but they come because of His Holiness,” he added. “Bodh Gaya benefits in a variety of ways. Is Tibet gaining anything? We should ponder about this part also.” The high-ranking monk wished the Dalai Lama would visit Sri Lanka and assist in overcoming the country’s present economic difficulties. “As His Holiness has been to Bodh Gaya, I believe. If he visits Sri Lanka, tens of thousands of tourists will visit, boosting the economy because we are in a slump. And, if His Holiness visits Sri Lanka, many tourists will flock here, as they did to Bodh Gaya. We will be blessed, and the economy will benefit as well,” he explained. The meeting with the Dalai Lama apparently impressed Makulewe Wimala Mahanayaka Thera, Mahanayaka Thera of Ramanna Maha Nikaya, who said “We were delighted to meet His Holiness the Dalai Lama, a spiritual leader. We have a grasp on spiritual activity. As a result, Mahasangha from Sri Lanka is pleased to witness what His Holiness is accomplishing.” Ven. Muruddeniya Dhammarathana Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter further said they are overjoyed because Bodh Gaya is like our motherland because Lord Buddha attained enlightenment there and they love that location.  However, We emphasised that China and Sri Lanka have been firmly supporting each other on issues concerning each other’s core interests, including the Tibet-related issue. Both sides, especially the Buddhist communities, must prevent a sneaky visit of the Dalai Lama to the island to promote “Tibetan independence” and safeguard the China-Sri Lanka historical relations from being damaged. The Chinese Embassy said Most Venerable Malwathu Mahanayaka Thera highly appraised the close friendship between Sri Lanka and China dating from Ven. Faxian Thera’s visit the island 1,600 years ago, and Chinas continued support to Sri Lanka since the latter’s independence, particularly during former PM Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s time. In the last three years of fighting against the Covid-19 and economic crisis, China has been assisting us greatly with PPEs, vaccines, rice, diesel etc., which is fully appreciated by the Sri Lanka people including the Maha Sangha.

The suspects and the fishing trawlers were escorted to the Port of Colombo yesterday (16). The arrests were made based on information revealed by a group on local fishing trawler, which was held during a special operation carried out by the Navy in waters west of Beruwala on 5 January. The same operation also led to the seizing of nearly 23.5 kg (including packages) of heroin smuggled by those suspects.  In order to curb illegal activities, including the smuggling of drugs via sea routes, Sri Lanka Navy conducts regular patrols and operations in the coastal and beach areas of the island. According to a coordinated operation carried out by the Navy together with other intelligence services, it has been revealed that a number of local multi-day fishing trawlers are involved in the smuggling of drugs into Sri Lanka. During the arrests made by SLNS Wickrama II on 5 January off Beruwala, 22 packages of heroin weighing 23kg and 235g (including packages) were seized from the suspicious trawler (Reg. No. IMUL–A –1610–MTR Kingfisher – 6). Along with the consignment of narcotics, five suspects and the drug-carrying trawler were also taken into custody. Based on information revealed by the suspects apprehended in that operation, two more local multi-day fishing trawlers (Reg. No. IMUL–A–1888–MTR Kingfisher – 8 and IMUL–A–2029–MTR Kingfisher – 3), suspected of smuggling drugs to Sri Lanka were intercepted off the western coast by SLNS Gajabahu on 7 and 8 January. During interrogation, the suspects aboard those trawlers admitted that they had thrown the stocks of narcotics overboard due to the presence of the Navy. The interrogation also revealed that drug traffickers have developed a new strategy in which they remove inside components of the multi-day fishing trawlers’ Radar Domes and conceal drugs within. The two fishing trawlers brought ashore are currently being inspected. Meanwhile, the fishing trawlers and 10 suspects will be handed over to the Police Narcotic Bureau for onward legal proceedings."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Government will purchase 61,600 MT of paddy to meet the requirement of 40,000 MT of rice. This programme is proposed to be implemented by District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries, with the assistance of small and medium-scale paddy mills. Under the District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries, rice will be distributed among the identified Samurdhi beneficiaries, including low-income earners using the existing system and the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment will coordinate the District Secretaries and issue necessary instructions to them. The total estimated cost for this programme is eight billion rupees, which includes Rs 6.2 billion for paddy purchase, Rs 290 million for rice drying, Rs 590 million as milling charges, Rs 200 million for packing costs, Rs 160 million as additional payment to mill owners and Rs 600 million for transportation. However, the programme’s estimated cost will vary depending on market fluctuations, and a budget provision of around Rs 10 billion will be allocated to be used if the need arises. According to data from the Departments of Agriculture and Agrarian Development, the land extent used for paddy cultivation, in the 2022/2023 Maha season, is approximately 732,201 hectares, and the expected yield is 3.3 million MT, while approximately 2.2 million MT of rice can be produced.  Given the country’s monthly rice requirement of approximately 210,000 MT, it has been observed that the next Maha season may see a paddy surplus. As a result, in order to protect both the paddy farmer and the consumer, the government must intervene in the purchase of a specific amount of paddy during the 2022/23 season. Furthermore, due to the country’s extremely difficult economic situation, it is necessary to protect low-income groups of society from the negative effects of the crisis by assisting them in maintaining a good nutritional level. This group consists of approximately two million families, including Samurdhi beneficiaries, the PMD said."

The Amnesty International, the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA), CIVICUS, Frontline Defenders, the Human Rights Watch, the International Working Group on Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice said that, since 21 August 2022, Mudalige was held in detention for 90 days on orders signed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), a draconian law that the government had long promised to repeal. They also pointed out that the Sri Lankan authorities should immediately impose a moratorium on the use of the PTA, and promptly repeal it. The authorities should immediately review the detention of anyone held under the PTA, ensuring adequate access to fair bail hearings. They should also release all protesters facing charges that do not meet international standards. A hearing on Mudalige’s bail application has been scheduled for 17 January 2023 at the Hulftsdorp Magistrate’s Court. Under the PTA, the Court does not usually grant bail if the Attorney General’s Department, acting on the Government’s behalf, opposes it. The Sri Lankan Government detained Mudalige as part of its crackdown since an economic crisis in 2022 sparked largely peaceful protests demanding governance reform and action against alleged official corruption. The government responded by giving sweeping powers to the Police and Military, which used unnecessary and excessive force to break up demonstrations and arrest hundreds of people, including many students. Many of those detained have since been released on bail. However, the authorities have used extraordinary powers, under the PTA, to keep Mudalige in detention despite having produced no evidence of any involvement in terrorism. As convenor of the Inter University Students’ Federation, he had taken a prominent part in the protests. For much of the time he has been held in solitary confinement and poor conditions, which can violate the prohibition on torture or other ill-treatment under international human rights law. In December 2022, Mudalige required hospital treatment for breathing difficulties. His family and his lawyer have expressed concern for his safety and his health in detention. On 4 October, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka issued a notice calling for the Police to ensure Mudalige’s safety in custody. The PTA allows for up to a year of detention without charge on the orders of the Defence Minister, who is currently President Wickremesinghe. Since it was introduced as a ‘temporary’ measure in 1979, the law has been used particularly to target members of the Tamil and Muslim communities and to stifle dissenting voices including journalists and human rights defenders. The United Nations and human rights groups have repeatedly documented that the PTA has been used to enable prolonged arbitrary detention and torture or other ill-treatment.  On 18 August 2022, the authorities arrested Mudalige along with 19 other people during a protest in Colombo, which the Police violently disrupted using excessive force. Two others arrested that day were also detained under the PTA, but both have since been released without charge. Hundreds of people arrested, under ordinary criminal legislation, for offenses allegedly committed during the 2022 protests, such as damage to public property, have also been released on bail. (SRM)"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/01/17/china-and-the-sovereign-debt-bomb/,China and the Sovereign-Debt Bomb,Author not found,0,2023-01-16T20:30:00+00:00," International capital flows have long been a major source of economic growth. Savings in higher-income countries have financed high-yielding investments in low-income countries, generating benefits for all. After World War II, capital flows under the Marshall Plan drove the rapid reconstruction of Europe, and after those countries recovered, they extended their own foreign aid and other official financial flows to the developing world. Private financing also increased substantially; by the 1990s, it accounted for over half of total capital flows to developing countries. Some of these flows led to spectacular results. South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world in the 1950s, with a savings rate of only 3% of GDP. But after implementing major policy reforms, it was able to avail itself of large capital inflows to finance investments with very high rates of return. It has since become an advanced economy. High savings and investment rates mean it has no difficulty servicing its debt. But not all low-income countries have pursued macroeconomic and other policies that are conducive to growth. Many have borrowed to cover balance-of-payments deficits and other problems, depleting their foreign-exchange reserves and jeopardising their access to private capital markets. For decades, the international community addressed these problems through the International Monetary Fund and an informal arrangement among official (government) creditors known as the Paris Club. When an indebted country ran into trouble, the IMF stepped in to provide short-term financing and recommend policy reforms designed to put the economy back on a sustainable growth path. Once the Fund and the debtor-country government had agreed on a reform programme, the Paris Club creditors could negotiate a reduction of the existing official bilateral debt to make it sustainable. Implicit in this process was that private creditors also must agree to a similar ‘haircut.’ Otherwise, the IMF’s bailout funds would end up being used to service the country’s debts to the private sector, rather than for restoring economic activity. Although this system for managing crises was far from perfect, it generally worked. But the situation has changed markedly in the past two decades, during which China has become a major lender to developing countries. As of 2022, the world’s 74 lowest-income countries had debt-service obligations totalling USD 35 billion, with  USD 13.1 billion – 37% – owed to China. According to a May 2021 Peterson Institute for International Economics policy brief, China accounts for over 50% of all debt owed by poor countries to official creditors. China’s emergence as a leading creditor has created problems, not least because it has refused an invitation to join the Paris Club. While Paris Club members share information about the sums owed to them, China does not. Nor has it been willing to participate meaningfully in multilateral debt-restructuring arrangements. Instead, it has operated as a black box, attaching nondisclosure agreements to many of its loans, and funnelling credit through a wide range of agencies. In 2020, the G20 – which includes China – agreed on a Common Framework for addressing debt distress in developing countries. But there has been little additional progress since then. This month, Ghana became only the fourth country to apply for support under the facility. Meanwhile, the number of countries facing serious debt-servicing issues has continued to grow. Zambia and Sri Lanka have already defaulted on their loans, and their economies are in deep recession. While Sri Lanka – along with Malawi – has tentatively accepted the terms of a new IMF programme, the agreement cannot be signed (or the funds disbursed) until the debt is made sustainable. But when the existing debt level is unsustainable, the IMF cannot approve the loan without all significant creditors agreeing to a restructuring. The resulting paralysis has put many other poor countries in danger. Tunisia cannot meet its budget without international bond financing. Ghana, already struggling under a heavy debt load, was forced in November to issue a six-month treasury bill with a ruinous 36% interest rate. Pakistan, after being devastated by floods last summer, has foreign-exchange reserves equal to only a month’s imports – well below a level deemed safe. And these are just a few of the countries with debt levels that are, or are likely to become, unsustainable. Without international help, these highly-indebted countries will be confronted with ongoing shortages of electricity, fuel, and other essentials (as we saw in Sri Lanka last year), leading to economic stagnation or decline. As more countries fall into this trap, humanitarian crises and sharp increases in poverty will follow. It is in everyone’s interest to find ways to ensure debt restructuring, along with the necessary economic policy reforms, for countries in dire need. A renewed push on this issue could produce an agreement between China and other creditor countries to the benefit of all. The most promising route, given the IMF’s crucial role in supporting macroeconomic policy reforms, would be to grant the Fund greater authority to deem debt unsustainable. Failure to get ahead of the developing world’s looming debt crises would represent a moral failure, and would also greatly dampen world economic growth, as it would induce greater pressure for protection in advanced countries and spur greater resistance to reforms in developing countries. The result would be prolonged stagnation and depression in debt-ridden economies, with huge humanitarian costs. Anne O.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/01/17/can-humanitys-new-giant-leap-into-space-succeed/,Can humanity’s new giant leap into space succeed?,Author not found,0,2023-01-16T20:30:00+00:00,"There is a new order emerging in space – a race between America and China. But with the demands of space exploration, even these great superpowers won’t be able to do it alone. Hugely technically challenging and costly goals have been touted, not least the aim of people living and working on other worlds, possibly within 10 years – but in a divided world where international goodwill is scarce, are they realistic? Nasa’s return to the Moon has begun with its Artemis programme. The first of three missions has been successfully launched. This uncrewed flight tested that the rockets and technology worked. The second mission will take humans further in space than they have ever gone before and the third launch will put astronauts on the Moon for a week, where they will carry out experiments. The long-term goal is to use the Moon as a jumping off point to get to Mars. But the programme is estimated to cost USD 93 billion (£ 76 billion), a heavy price tag for the American taxpayer, who is already feeling the economic squeeze. In a report to Congress last year, the US Auditor General’s office warned of an ‘unrealistic -development schedule’ and likely overruns, adding that Nasa needed to make cost estimates “more reliable and transparent”. Yet, although Nasa will get less overall funding than it asked for in 2023, Congress, at the moment, still supports its human space exploration ventures. China has achieved its own fully-operational space station, Tiangong, in orbit on schedule. The Chinese space programme has launched probes to the Moon and Mars. It plans to establish an unmanned research station on the Moon by 2025 and then land astronauts on its surface by 2030. Putting an astronaut on the Moon has been done before but the next step, to Mars, is much more difficult. It is 250 times further away than the Moon and there is no spacecraft currently capable of sending humans to the red planet. Even if scientists can find a safe way to launch a fuel-heavy rocket and land it on a planet with such a thin atmosphere, there is the further challenge of returning the astronauts safely home after months in space. Historically, superpowers have jostled for supremacy above the Earth. America and Russia vied for dominance in the 1950s and 1960s. The Russians put the first man in orbit. The Americans landed a man and planted their flag on the Moon a few years later. In the 1970s a golden era of cooperation was forged, culminating in the construction of the International Space Station (ISS), which began in 1998. Along with 13 other partner nations, the two superpowers built what is now the largest structure in space. It is not owned by any one nation, and each depends on the other to operate. It was a symbol of what humanity could achieve if nations put aside their differences and worked together. But the reality was somewhat different. Notably America prevented China from becoming a partner in the ISS, so the Chinese went their own way. More recently, within weeks of the invasion of Ukraine, nations stopped working with Russia. Two joint Moon missions between the European Space Agency (ESA) and Russia have been cancelled, as has a joint Mars Rover project to search for signs of life on the red planet. Yet scratch the surface and collaboration continues on the ISS, where Western countries have to work with Russia to maintain it in orbit. Americans and Europeans even still train in the centre of Moscow at Russia’s Space HQ, Star City. But what happens once the ISS comes to the end of its lifetime in 2030? Juliana Suess, a space policy analyst at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London says Russia has much less to offer partner nations than it once did because its technology is outdated. She raises the possibility that the first nation into space could be the first one out. “If the Russians haven’t figured out an alternative by the time the ISS is decommissioned or develops its own space station, which given the current circumstances and sanctions is quite unlikely, it might not have any human spaceflight,” she says. Russia’s plight comes at a time when China’s space programme is advancing rapidly. In the last 10 years it has launched more than 200 rockets, even though America’s spending on space still makes China’s look small. China is mindful that partnerships offer technical know-how and money. It has invited other nations prohibited from access to the ISS to join them and has made a call for proposals for scientific experiments. Seventy-two countries now have their own space programmes because they can’t afford to be left behind in what has become a new space race. The billionaire spacefarers Space is a vital part of our everyday lives. We depend on satellites for weather forecasts, communications, bank transitions, not to mention valuable surveillance tools for nation States. And it’s getting busy out there. In 2021, about 5,000 satellites were launched. Going back 20 years, about 800 were launched annually. Space is an expensive and technically difficult business. No one country can do it alone. New partnerships are being forged, notably with the new brash billionaires on the block. Elon Musk’s company, SpaceX, is already taking passengers into orbit. The billionaire entrepreneur is bringing down costs with a reusable rocket. Not to be outdone, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos wants to build a commercial orbiting station, called Orbital Reef. Helen Sharman, who was the UK’s first astronaut, on a mission to the Soviet Space Station Mir in 1991, believes that current international rivalries could be put in the shade by the pragmatism of the private sector. “It really is going to be commercialisation that brings companies together worldwide,” she told the BBC. “We don’t care where they are registered, what matters is what they do for the benefit of the world.” (BBC)"

A press conference was held yesterday (16) with regard of the UPP’s participation in the 2023 Local Government elections. According to UPP Propaganda Secretary Chaminda Gunasinghe, the party expects to present a new vision and programme to overcome the difficult situation the country has been placed in due to 74 years of wrong political decisions, bureaucracy, and inefficiency. This would be a solution-oriented political movement that goes beyond mere criticism, he said. He said citizens who want to join this political movement are welcome to join the party and contest upcoming elections. A prominent face in the Aragalaya, Akila Viraj Konara, who is contesting the Maharagama Urban Council poll, told the media that clinging onto ‘Aragalaya’ forever is useless and it is time to do some real work to ensure the country’s economic stability. Konara said he is currently involved in a project related to digital economy and the main reason for joining the UPP to enter politics is the freedom given by the party to pursue such projects. Meanwhile, addressing the same media briefing, another member of the party, Mashi Senanayake, said the representation of women in the Sri Lanka Parliament is very low and in order to discuss women’s issues, more women should enter politics. “The LG election is the only election in Sri Lanka where a specific quota is set aside for the representation of women. Therefore, women are invited to join the UPP and change the current situation in the country,” she said. Another member of the UPP Chatura Rajapaksa also highlighted that while this LG Poll is referred to as a ‘small election’ it is as important just like a general election in the current political climate. So candidates of any party in this election must present a specific programme on their plans for LG Authorities, he noted. BY Thameenah Razeek"

The Yeti Airlines flight from Kathmandu to the tourist town of Pokhara crashed on landing before catching fire. Videos posted on social media show an aircraft flying low over a populated area before banking sharply. At least 68 people are confirmed to have died, officials said. Several critically injured survivors were taken to hospital, unconfirmed reports said. Local resident Deeveta Kal told the BBC how she rushed to the crash site after seeing the aircraft plunge from the sky shortly after 11:00 a.m. local time (05:15 GMT). “By the time I was there the crash site was already crowded. There was huge smoke coming from the flames of the plane. And then helicopters came over in no time,” she said. “The pilot tried his best to not hit civilisation or any home,” Deevta Kal added. “There was a small space right beside the Seti River and the flight hit the ground in that small space.” The flight set out with 68 passengers on board, including at least 15 foreign nationals, and four crew members. According to flight tracking website Flightradar24, the 15-year-old twin-engine ATR 72 stopped transmitting position data at 05:05 GMT and the last signal from the aircraft was received at 05:12. Hundreds of Nepalese soldiers are involved in the operation at the crash site in the gorge of the Seti, just one and a half kilometres from the airport. Video taken where the plane came down showed thick billowing black smoke and burning debris. “We expect to recover more bodies,” an army spokesman told Reuters, saying the plane “has broken into pieces.” Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal called an emergency meeting of his cabinet and urged state agencies to work on rescue operations. A panel to investigate the cause of the crash has been set up. Of the passengers, 53 are said to be Nepalese. There were five Indian, four Russians and two Koreans on the plane. There was also one passenger each from Ireland, Australia, Argentina and France among others. Aviation accidents are not uncommon in Nepal, often due to its remote runways and sudden weather changes that can make for hazardous conditions. A Tara Air plane crashed in May 2022 in the northern Nepalese district of Mustang, killing 22 people. In early 2018, 51 people were killed when a US-Bangla flight travelling from Dhaka in Bangladesh caught fire as it landed in Kathmandu. The European Union has banned Nepalese airlines from its airspace over concerns about training and maintenance standards in the country’s aviation industry. (BBC)"

Meanwhile, during a recent debate in Parliament, Rajapakshe revealed that the company selected to print the safety stickers in Sri Lanka was the world’s most corrupt in this regard. He also said the Indian company was accused of fraud and irregularities involving safety stickers in many countries around the world. He told Parliament that if the company legally gives the government ten million stickers, it illegally gives the private sector twenty million stickers. In addition, the Minister of Justice stated that the government loses approximately Rs 60 billion per year due to fraud involving alcohol safety stickers. In addition, a mobile application has been introduced to verify the accuracy of the sticker affixed to the alcohol consumed. The ‘EXCISE TAX STAMP VALIDATOR’ mobile phone application can be downloaded on the phone, and the accuracy of the security sticker can be checked, as well as information regarding fake stickers can be given to the Excise Department by calling the number 1913."

The protest was held by the Families of the Disappeared and the University Students of Jaffna as President Wickremesinghe arrived in at the Palaly International Airport for the celebrations at about 3 pm. President delivered his speech at the Dhurkadevi Mani Mandapam, later on. President Wickremesinghe was driven to the city of Jaffna from the Airport heavily guarded to the Sivan Kovil in Nallur for Pongal rituals, the people who had already planned the protests, marched through the streets of Jaffna. The President was greeted with a red carpet by Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda. He also drew a golden shawl over his shoulders, as is customary among Tamils. “Ranil – Don’t bribe us, we want our loved ones back” and “We don’t want your Pongal; we want our land back” were some of the banners held by the protesters in Jaffna who were dispersed by water cannons. A scuffle broke out between the police and university students in the Nallur, Sivan Kovil at Aarasadi area too following which the riot police and the STF were mobilised in the area to stop the students from coming. The police presence in the area with water cannons and tear gas canisters added to the tension. Despite that, they remained protesting and tried to remove the heavily guarded barricades by the police and the STF. The protesters most being women members of the Families of the Missing Persons and the Jaffna University students, called the president to give them back their relatives who disappeared during the war. Meanwhile, the security forces have obstructed a bus taking the Tamil families of the disappeared from Mullaitivu to Jaffna to join a large-scale protest as Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe visits the district for Thai Pongal. Women were seen pleading to the riot police to return their missing relatives showing their photos and demanding they meet the president in the mani mandapam. Recently, the President guaranteed the Tamil polity that he would find a solution to the ethnic issue before the 4 February Independence Day. Still, the north-east Tamils have maintained that the government had fooled them and had not settled the burning national question.  Pix by T Pratheepan        By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan and T.

Speaking at Durga Hall in Jaffna where festivities took place, the President further said to build a country where all races live together and achieve economic prosperity all must return to the ‘Sri Lankan’ identity envisioned by D.S. Senanayake 75 years ago. President Wickremesinghe also announced that he will make a special statement in February on the Government’s measures to bring about reconciliation and said that he will call a meeting of the party leaders next week to seek their views and opinions on the matter. Amongst many other pledges the President also assured expediting the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to provide relief to the families of the disappeared. “This country needs reconciliation. As a result of 30 years of war and insurgencies our country has been divided by divisive, racist, sectarian and bankrupt politics.  We must return to the Sri Lankan identity that was created by D.S. Senanayake since we all have to live in one country and build the economy,” he added. These issues cannot be resolved by putting them aside and postponing them. The solution should be told to the country and the Parliament. We can’t keep playing Pandu when it comes to these issues. That is why Parliament’s views are first sought, he explained. “We have discussed a number of issues. It is necessary to provide relief to the relatives of the missing persons, to find the truth, to find out what happened. Also, the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will be expedited to find out about this.  “Three weeks ago I asked the Army Commander what his opinion is about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He said it is an absolute necessity to establish the commission as it could be the only way to answer the allegations against the three forces. No one has so far voiced any objection to this Commission. “Instead of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, we are bringing a new law. Some say that this bill would be used against those in the North. There’s no such ulterior motive and we will use this to create stability in the country. Next is the land issue. Today we are discussing the issues related to the Wildlife Department. We are also discussing the return of land in Jaffna. During the war, the army maintained about 30,000 acres under its control because it wanted to protect these areas. Today, only 3,000 acres remain under the security forces. The army has expressed its willingness to hand over another part of it. We are discussing about it,” he added"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/01/16/china-expects-to-be-paid-back-imf-chief/,China expects to be paid back – IMF Chief,Author not found,0,2023-01-15T20:30:00+00:00,"Problems that China has in restructuring debt owed to it by countries like Sri Lanka is that they expect to be paid back because it is a developing country, IMF Managing Director (MD) Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday (12 January). The IMF, in an upload on its website the following day Friday (13 January), further quoting Georgieva warned that if countries like Sri Lanka are not provided with debt restructuring, it will be very difficult for those countries to provide basic services to the poor. Georgieva made these comments when she was interviewed by IMF’s Communications Director Julie Kozack, the IMF website further said. IMF Headquarters is located in Washington, D.C. The IMF Managing Director further said China is becoming a very significant source of lending and also bears responsibility to support countries when they’re faced with inability to service that debt. To quote more excerpts from the interview, Question: One of the issues the US and others are saying is that China, with a portion of the debt, of course, countries have to China. I was wondering if you’ve seen any particular progress on that front, that China would be more willing to take a haircut in some of these situations? Answer: We have engaged with the Chinese authorities, working on two very important issues: One, coordination among Chinese agencies that would allow all sources of debt to China to be part of the discussion for a solution. And this has been a long process and it is still continuing. China does not have the tradition of that coordination that exists in more mature lenders. China has many agencies and entities involved. The second area we have engaged with China is at the country level, to define a pathway for debt resolution of Chad, Zambia, also, we are discussing Sri Lanka, Suriname, to help China understand both the whole issue of debt sustainability and what can be a pathway for their contribution. When we were in China last month, we asked to have a meeting with the two key agencies, the China’s Finance Ministry and the People’s Bank of China; as well as with the large lenders in China, Exim Bank and China Development Bank. They came for this meeting and we had a very constructive and frank discussion on these issues. What is the biggest problem internally, domestically for China? It is the notion, and is actually very broadly shared by many officials and citizens in China, that China is still a developing country and therefore China will try to offer support to all developing countries genuinely with the objective to help, but also, they expect to be paid back because it is a developing country. So a haircut in the Chinese context is politically very difficult, but they understood, after many interactions that there are ways in which they can reach the equivalency of a haircut by stretching maturities, reducing or eliminating interest rates, payments and the Paris Club in their own engagement with China, so that there might be a way to reach the same objective in a way that in terms of reducing the burden of debt. Now, of course, it is much better if debt reduction is done upfront, not to that reprofiling, but to as you said, haircut. So, we of course, continue to discuss with China, the value for China as a lender to have their exposure to countries defined in a way that is rational and then the countries can actually service that debt. For countries that are suffering under tremendous burden of debt, they cannot possibly serve, that translates into reducing social services for their own people.

The President made these observations during a meeting with trade union representatives at the President’s Office held recently. Government, semi-government and private sector trade union leaders and representatives participated in the meeting which was presided over by the President and the Prime Minister to discuss measures that could be taken to find solutions to the economic and financial crisis in the country. Stating that the country’s economy is expected to improve after the first quarter of this year, the President expressed his confidence in achieving better economic progress in 2024. The President pointed out that not only the public sector but the private sector should also be strengthened to provide relief to the people while continuing with the development programmes of the country. He further said he is aware of the hardships the people are going through today and added that he would somehow provide relief to the public. The President also pointed out that measures have been taken to provide rice to about two million families who are not entitled to Samurdhi benefits during March and April.  “Additionally, we have one more problem. In the Global sphere, the economic growth in Europe and America is now slowing down. Under such a situation, our export market may drop by next year and we have to develop our tourism industry”, he said. “We would be able to increase the Inland Revenue by the end of this year. Then some relief could be given to the people. However, before that, the country’s economy should be strengthened where not only the public sector but the private sector as well. Otherwise, there would be a gap. First, we need to find out what relief could be given to the people. We have made allocations to provide rice to about two million families, in March and April, who are not entitled to Samurdhi benefits,” the President said. Speaking further he also noted that working people and small-scale entrepreneurs were facing the most difficulties.  He said problems have arisen in both public and private banks as well. “We must protect the banking system and when they are not protected, small-scale entrepreneurs borrowing from such banks could collapse. What is the next step then? How should the economy be managed from 2024? The export economy should be strengthened by protecting the competitiveness of businesses. Similarly, concessions should be given to the working people. I suggest that not only the public sector but also private businesses, marketing boards, trade unions, farmers, and all should discuss lengthily and at least reach a framework of a social agreement on how we can advance this economic programme,” he said.  Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said due to the measures taken by the Government in the last few months, the economic situation of the country is changing to some extent. “To strengthen the situation in the future, we need to cooperate and improve products and services. It is on that basis that we can raise our heads as a country and the participation of working people in that endeavour is of paramount importance,” he said."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

The Supreme Court also ordered former Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara and former Head of State Intelligence SDIG Nilantha Jayawardena to pay a sum of Rs 75 million each, former Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Hemasiri Fernando, to pay a sum of Rs 50 million and former Chief of National Intelligence Sisira Mendis to pay a sum of Rs 10 million as compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks. The order was made when 12 petitions, filed against those responsible for the Easter Sunday attacks, were taken up before a Supreme Court Bench comprising Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya and Justices Buwaneka Aluwihare, L.T.B. Dehideniya, Murdu N.B. Fernando, S. Thurairaja, A.H.M.D. Nawaz and A.L. Shiran Gooneratne. Whilst Sirisena, Jayasundara, Jayawardena, Fernando and Mendis were named as respondents to the Petitions, Court held that their failure to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019 despite having received intelligence information has infringed the fundamental rights enshrined under Article 12(1) and 14(1)(e) of the Constitution. The above sums were ordered to be paid out of the personal funds of the respondents. These payments have to be made to a Victim Fund, to be set up at the Office for Reparations and maintained in an escrow. Court held that it was Sirisena’s obligation to have had a constant vigil over his ministerial functions, as National Security was his portfolio and he should have exercised his supervision over his Departmental Heads, regardless of personal predilections for particular officers. It was also stated that Sirisena could not be relieved from his constitutional obligation of ensuring the national security of the country. Court also held that Jayawardena and Jayasundara were both aware of the potential threats by the mastermind of the Easter Sunday attacks Zaharan Hashim, his cohorts and the NTJ, long prior to the Easter Sunday attacks. With regard to Mendis, Court held that he fell short of his primary duty of sharing intelligence and he omitted to ensure that the intelligence received on 4 April 2019 was disseminated to other intelligence agencies, for instance Director of Military Intelligence. Further, with regard to Fernando, Court held that although Fernando chaired the Weekly Intelligence Coordinating Conference on 9 April 2019, he did not take any initiative to open a discussion on this vital piece of intelligence and has thereby failed in his duty as the supervisory authority of the State Intelligence Service. Court further ordered the Office for Reparation to investigate into the underpayment and non-payment of compensation to victims and families of the deceased and for accurate information by way of a motion to be submitted to Courts within three months from the date of the judgment. The Attorney General was also directed to liaise with the Office for Reparation and notify the Court of same. The Bench further ordered that disciplinary action be taken against SDIG Jayawardena.

This recommendation was made by the committee after obtaining statements from several Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) officials and team members. The report said cricketer Bhanuka Rajapaksa, who was a Buddhist, has become a follower of the Born Again cult. A Born Again Pastor named Terry had met cricketer Chamika Karunaratne and preached about the importance of the cult. According to the report, there are several SLC officials and national team players who are followers of Born Again. The report also says, controversial Pastor Jerome Fernando, who introduces himself as a Prophet, takes various steps to increase the number of followers of his cult. At the same time, it was observed that some cricketers hesitated to provide statements to the committee due to fear of jeopardising their careers, the report claimed. Furthermore, the report shed light on many alleged financial misappropriations that occurred during the said tour. The SLC has spent more than Rs 25 million on air tickets for 16 officers. Also, more than USD 100,000 has been spent as additional expenses. It is also revealed that SLC Chief Operating Officer Jerome Jayaratne’s visa and air tickets had been sponsored by the Sri Lanka Cricket and he had also been provided a per diem of USD 7,000 for 10 days. However, he has done nothing related to the tour as an SLC official. Although Jayaratne engage in promotional activities, the committee said there is no need for him to go overseas as it can simply done by e-mails. Jayaratne launched a promotional campaign for the men’s T20 World Cup in 2022 and his duty was terminated during the tournament. Jayaratne went Australia on26 October 2022 and returned to the country on 8 or 9 November 2022. He had spent the days in the house of his sister, the report said. Moreover, the committee recommended to grant permission for the cricketers’ spouses to accompany them on tours, for it would help in ensuring their mental health and stop the cricketers from going outside their hotels at night.

Being one of the initial flying formations in Air Force antiquity, No. 3 Squadron was originally inaugurated in 1965 at Air Force Base China Bay and history of the Squadron indicates that in December 1971, it was refurbished as a fully-fledged operational flying formation and renamed as No. 3 Maritime Squadron, headed by Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader Noor Rahim under the guidance of then Commander of the Air Force, Air Vice Marshal P.H. Mendis. The Squadron logo featured the ‘Red-wattled Lapwing (Kirala),’ to indicate the role of the Squadron of providing early warning. Initially, the Squadron inventory comprised de Havilland Dove aircraft and it was entrusted with dawn to dusk reconnaissance patrols of the Eastern Coast from Point Pedro to Galle as a deterrent to possible Arms smuggling, a need felt during the 1971 insurgency. The Squadron shifted to SLAF Base Katunayake with the addition of the Cessna 337 aircraft and again relocated to SLAF Base China Bay in 1988 to conduct surveillance operations against the LTTE.

The Squadron was re-established at SLAF Academy China Bay on 11 January 2019, fulfilling the need of an operational flying formation entrusted with maritime/ land surveillance and HADR operations and equipped with Y-12 and B-200 aircraft. Wing Commander Vidura Premasinghe (Rtd) was the first Commanding Officer after the re-establishment and since then the Squadron is on 24×7 operational readiness to conduct surveillance, HADR and other flying commitments and has expanded its operations with the induction of the newest addition of SLAF, the Dornier 228 aircraft from Indian Navy. At the present average of three sorties per week, this Squadron covers about 50,000 km2 islandwide. The Squadron is now equipped with a Beechcraft King Air B-200 aircraft and Do-228.

Though they set out with full of hope and expectation, they have been cheated and even their fundamental rights are being denied. He also charged the employers don’t take any interest in their welfare. Those who were employed during Covid-19 were severely affected and they were even deprived of their basic rights.  Paramasingam said that some employees who returned from foreign countries met him and related their woes.

Consequently, CBSL sold all the Rs 88,000 million T Bills offered at Wednesday’s auction, allowing for a 100 per cent subscription for each of the tenures offered. Subsequently, CBSL sold all of the 91,182 and 364-day tenures offered at Wednesday’s auction, with their splits being Rs 50,000 million, Rs 20,000 million and Rs 18,000 million, respectively. The WAYs fetched for the 91, 182 and 364-day tenures at Wednesday’s auction were 31.15 per cent, 31.37 per cent and 29.04 per cent, down 86 basis points (bps), 65 bps and 12 bps each, Week-on-Week (WoW), respectively. The fact that the WAY of the 364-day maturity being smaller than both the 91 and 182 day maturities for the twentieth consecutive market week to Wednesday and that of only the 91-day maturity for the twenty first consecutive market week to Wednesday is an indication that the market expects yield pressure to last only in the short term. In related developments, CBSL on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL), will have to repay to the market, a total of Rs 82,152 million maturities, corresponding to the relevant 91, 182 and 364-day repayments by today (13). However, maturing T Bills held by CBSL, and which also have to be repaid by today are unknown as CBSL the steward of GoSL debt has not revealed their value. In addition, CBSL, by a previous placement, sold Rs 788 million worth of T Bills of both 182 and 364-day maturities, of which the 364-day maturity repayment is also due by today. However, CBSL has failed to give the related maturity splits of the above Rs 788 million T Bill sale. Usually, investments in T Bills are risk-free, because if GoSL is unable to repay such debt, generally, CBSL is mandated to print demand-pull inflationary money and repay such creditors. Domestically, issuing of T Bills is a key instrument used by GoSL to raise money locally. By Paneetha Ameresekere"

It was also revealed that due to the economic crisis, there has been a tendency for people associated with the construction industry to leave the country. The Chair of the sub-committee said that if solutions that require money, solutions that do not require money and legal solutions are not identified and implemented separately, the country’s engineering sector will suffer a major collapse.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

K. Stalin, to support the Sri Lankan Tamils’ political struggle and achieve fruitful results this year. Sumanthiran said yesterday (12), at a mega conference attended by all leaders of Tamil communities around the world and over 500 representatives from various international Tamil organizations, that whenever there is trouble faced by the Sri Lankan Tamils, Tamil Nadu will stand by them. He appreciated the recent cargo, meant for the Tamils of Sri Lanka, sent in three ships and said that gesture will not be forgotten. Leader of Tamil Progressive Party MP Mano Ganesan was also present.  The conference also discussed the history of non-resident Tamils and research on the Tamil language. The political struggle in Sri Lanka is nothing new and does not need to be repeated, Sumanthiran said, urging all Tamils to speak up in order to find a lasting solution to the ethnic problem and Tamil concerns in Sri Lanka. “If something happens to the Sri Lankan Tamils, Tamil Nadu, which is just over 20 kilometres away, has questioned it and we have our brothers in Tamil Nadu to rely on,” Sumanthiran said. He thanked Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Stalin and presented him with a ‘Yarl’ music instrument as a token of his undying friendship and support that is pure and genuine.  He stated that the political struggle for Tamil rights would continue, and recalled how the struggle also reached a point of taking up arms. Regardless of how it ended, he said, the political struggle continues and they have not given up. “Our uniqueness is preserved, and Tamils will continue to speak out and fight for their rights, and we believe we can succeed,” he said. Even senior M. K. Karunanidhi and the current Tamil Nadu government has given us immense hope, he stated.   He also stated that the talks they had with Sri Lanka’s incumbent President, prior to his arrival in Tamil Nadu, were fruitless. “We want the government to do what they had promised the Tamil people. We have given them a week to give us a response but while all of this is going on, the support from Tamil Nadu has given us hope of achieving our political ambitions, and we urge the Government of Tamil Nadu, as well as all other Tamil leaders and Tamil voices, to continue to support us in our struggle,” Sumanthiran said. “Your support is hugely needed and for 25 years or so the struggle continues and we want it to be fulfilled, hopefully to resolve it this year,” he added.  MP Ganesan added that his participation at the event, when the upcountry Tamils will mark 200 years since arrival from Tamil Nadu, was a great opportunity.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

General Secretary of the All Ceylon Nurses’ Union (ACNU), S.B. Mediwatta yesterday (11) warned that nurses including those serving at the National Hospitals Colombo and Kandy and Karapitiya would protest the from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. demanding the Government to either find solutions or step down as it was not able to give solutions to the drug shortage in State hospitals and other issues. Nurses worked closely with in-ward patients and patients complained to them when they do not get their medicine or are unable to undergo required laboratory tests. The issue has been growing since last year and the Government has been unable to find any long-term solution, they said. The protests are also against the unjust manner in which the State and private banks had increased interest rates on loans as a result of the Central Bank’s lending rates. Mediwatta said it had severely impacted nurses who had taken loans from Banks and were unable to meet their loan payments as a result of  increased rates. Their wages were not upped at the rate that Banks have increased interest rates for loan payments. Nurses wages’ have not increased parallel to the new hike in electricity bills, he lamented. The ACNU General Secretary said on 5 July 2021,  the Government pledged to amend a Circular and award Grade promotions to 14,000 nurses. They have to serve for five years to be promoted from Class Three to Class Two and seven years to be promoted to Class One. But due to shortcomings in the Circular even after a lapse of one year and five months the Health Ministry has been dragging its feet regarding the promotions. He said nurses would be able to get increments with the promotions that were long due.  Madewatta lashing out said the State was not doing anything to fill cadre requirements in hospitals. Nursing posts were left vacant due to retirement and the increasing tendency of nurses leaving the country to serve abroad. He accused the Health Ministry of violating circular 2/19/2019 issued in 2003 by the then Health Secretary. Payments were made according to this Circular till recently. But now there were attempts to violate that Circular and reduce payments.     By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

General Secretary of the All Ceylon Nurses’ Union (ACNU), S.B. Mediwatta yesterday (11) warned that nurses including those serving at the National Hospitals Colombo and Kandy and Karapitiya would protest the from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. demanding the Government to either find solutions or step down as it was not able to give solutions to the drug shortage in State hospitals and other issues. Nurses worked closely with in-ward patients and patients complained to them when they do not get their medicine or are unable to undergo required laboratory tests. The issue has been growing since last year and the Government has been unable to find any long-term solution, they said. The protests are also against the unjust manner in which the State and private banks had increased interest rates on loans as a result of the Central Bank’s lending rates. Mediwatta said it had severely impacted nurses who had taken loans from Banks and were unable to meet their loan payments as a result of  increased rates. Their wages were not upped at the rate that Banks have increased interest rates for loan payments. Nurses wages’ have not increased parallel to the new hike in electricity bills, he lamented. The ACNU General Secretary said on 5 July 2021,  the Government pledged to amend a Circular and award Grade promotions to 14,000 nurses. They have to serve for five years to be promoted from Class Three to Class Two and seven years to be promoted to Class One. But due to shortcomings in the Circular even after a lapse of one year and five months the Health Ministry has been dragging its feet regarding the promotions. He said nurses would be able to get increments with the promotions that were long due.  Madewatta lashing out said the State was not doing anything to fill cadre requirements in hospitals. Nursing posts were left vacant due to retirement and the increasing tendency of nurses leaving the country to serve abroad. He accused the Health Ministry of violating circular 2/19/2019 issued in 2003 by the then Health Secretary. Payments were made according to this Circular till recently. But now there were attempts to violate that Circular and reduce payments.     By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Nagarajah, an Indian National was involved in the Sugar Industry and acted as a representative/ shareholder to a foreign investor who was interested in purchasing the State-owned Kanthale Sugar Factory. The evidence led before the High Court at Bar revealed (that the Complainant had observed an inordinate delay in implementing the unsolicited proposal to purchase the Kanthale Sugar Factory when the matter had been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. Since the Complainant was not happy with the progress made, he brought it to the notice of an official in the Prime Minister’s Officer and the matter had referred to the CIABOC by an Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister’s Officer. The Complainant Nagarajah had appeared before the Investigation Unit of CIABOC on a telephone message received by the said division.

Thereby, the aggregate sentence imposed 20 years Rigorous Imprisonment with a fine of Rs 65000 and compensation of Rs 20 million in terms of section 26 of the Bribery Act for Mahanama and 12 years Rigorous Imprisonment with a fine ofRs 55,000 for Dissanayake. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence imposed on them by the High Court at Bar, both Accused Appellants had preferred two appeals to the Supreme Court. Amongst the arguments put forth by appellants was that they were deprived of a fair trial. Thereby, the Bench yesterday (11), concluded that the investigative technique adopted by the CIABOC does not amount to an entrapment and that the Appellants have not been deprived of a fair trial and upheld the decision of the High Court.

With regard to co-curricular activities, we believe that it is our duty to continuously focus on these areas to give students a holistic education. Drama is one such activity. Many skills are developed by involving in drama such as Programme Creativity, Communication, Problem solving, Accountability, Collaboration, Perseverence, Time management and focus to name a few. Drama also improves social skills including empathy and improves emotional balance, broadens perspectives and critical thinking, builds self-confidence and assists risk taking and encourages team work and co-operation. In my opinion, drama encourages students to think and act creatively, thus developing critical thinking and problem solving skills that can be applied in all areas of learning. Through drama, children are encouraged to take responsible roles and make choices, to participate and guide their own learning. Drama nourishes the imagination. Drama also teaches patience and commitment. Communication is one of the main objectives of drama. Like all the Arts, drama enables students to communicate and understand others. Drama the in school curriculum can develop students ‘ artistic and creative dispositions. It can also enable students to generate new knowledge and skills that are transferable to a variety of artistic, social and work related contexts. We believe that drama is a powerful tool for learning and ‘Whole-Person development’. We want to empower students to use Drama to: Examples of these positive attitudes are: Perseverence, Commitment, Care for others and Respect for fair play. In my opinion, “Drama is an important tool for preparing our young Josephians to live and work in this world that is increasingly Team oriented” rather than hierarchical. Also, Drama can help to build responsible global citizens. That is our ultimate goal and vision. Rev. Fr. Ranjith Andradi, Rector of St. Joseph’s College wished Master Niven Nanayakkara, President of the English Literary Association and his team members success  and is confident that they will regain the Championship this year too. He is also thankful to the teacher-in-charge Sonali Perera andKevin Cruze,  director of Cold Theartre 7 for developing the young Josephians to perform on stage better, besides developing their personalities to become multi-talented students and be of benefit to society. The Chief Guest will be Cinema, Stage Drama and television personality, Wilson Gunaratne. St.Joseph’s College which has imparted knowledge to its highest and broadest sense and produced a galaxy of Josephians, grow from strength to strength”. By Maruthai Ravindhiran"

After placing the SLPP deposits for the Kurunegala District MP Fernando said, “We are confident that as a party we will emerge victorious at the upcoming election. The intelligent people of this country are with us.” Before placing the deposits we participated in religious observances at the Bauddhaloka Vihara in Kurunegala and received the blessings of the Maha Sangha. We are already ahead in this campaign. Some parties are not even ready with their nomination lists. They are not even ready for the elections but demand an elections. This shows their duplicity. The media asks us whether we have problems in working with Ranil Wickremesinghe. How could that be a problem? It is we who elected him the President. He is our president, so why it would be a problem for us to work with him? Sajith Premadasa and others did not come forward when the post and responsibility were offered to them. Only Ranil Wickremesinghe accepted the challenge. Asked to comment on the SLPP’s standpoint over the Central Bank bond scam, the former minister said: “We have not reversed our position. We still demand that punishments must be meted out to those who are responsible for the Bond Scam. “Our leader is President Mahinda Rajapaksa. We have not changed that,” he said."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He noted that he received the proposal to amend the Electricity Bill on 9 January. Addressing the media yesterday (10), he said the proposal of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was received by the commission on Monday (9) and the PUCSL was informed to consult with the relevant parties and submit amendments if there is any by 15 February. “We have no objections to that. The issue for us is that we only received this proposal on 9 January. This procedure typically takes 45-50 days. However, we see in the second paragraph of the Cabinet paper that this tariff hike will be effective as an interim measure from 1 January 2023. There is no system in place to change the Electricity Bill in such a way that it affects the past,” he said. Meanwhile, Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardana said the PUCSL has now been given the opportunity to consult with other authorities and come up with better amendments to the Minister of Power and Energy’s Cabinet-approved electricity tariff hike. Speaking at the weekly Cabinet media briefing, he said the electricity tariff hike will take effect from 1 January. According to him, Cabinet has been advised to make the new electricity tariff revision effective 1 January, in consultation with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and PUCSL. “If the PUCSL proposes new amendments, they will be applied and the required calculations will be done from the next month onwards by the CEB. This means that if the PUCSL states that a tariff reduction is possible, the reduction will begin the following month,” he explained. Cabinet considered the proposal submitted by the President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stability and National Policies and the Minister of Power and Energy regarding the electricity tariff revision. It was further observed by Cabinet that the Treasury is not able to provide the necessary funds for the CEB and therefore there is no other option but to revise the existing electricity tariffs to ensure a continuous electricity supply in the country while minimising the impact on electricity consumers as much as possible.

According to Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardana, who cited the President, the income from taxes paid by the public will be depleted in the months of January, February, and March 2023, impacting the Treasury. Gunawardana, speaking at the Cabinet media briefing yesterday (10) said the payment of Samurdhi allowances to all low-income families is likely to be delayed by nearly two weeks. “The payments of State sector employees’ salaries and welfare expenses such as the Samurdhi allowances have proved difficult for the months of January, February and March. The potential income that could be earned through taxes in the first few months of 2023 has been reduced greatly due to the economic crisis,” he said. Further, he said despite a significant decrease in Government revenue for the months of January, February, and March, essential payments must still be made. He also said the Treasury does not have enough funds to cover day-to-day expenses such as government employee salaries, pensions, interest on government loans, and welfare expenses. “Thus, we will be prioritising the payment of the salaries of public servants and pensions. Because of the financial crisis, Cabinet was also told to cut 5 per cent from all proposals submitted by ministries for the 2023 Budget,” Gunawardena said. He said to pay salaries or the interest on loans, the Government used to print money previously. However, he stressed that this is no longer an option, and that the decision to cut 5 per cent from spending will be unpopular. He said Samurdhi allowances will be paid, but a delay is anticipated.

Adarsha’s Counsel had informed the Court that if his client is arrested in this regard, it could pose a threat to her life and therefore he urged the Court to issue an order for her release on bail before her imminent arrest.

One of the respondents to the anticipatory bail application, the CID, too was present in Court and stated that as the suspect has failed to support the on-going probe into the case, if she is granted bail it could hamper the inquiry. Hence, the CID requested the Court to not enlarge the suspect on bail. Taking the submissions into consideration, the Chief Magistrate mentioned that as it was unsuitable at this time to grant the anticipatory bail, to the applicant, he was rejecting it.

Hapuhinna, in the letter said the directive was issued to the District Secretaries, as per the decision taken by the Cabinet on Monday (9). However, the Secretary withdrew the letter, which was issued yesterday (10) morning, on the evening of the same day. The Election Commission (EC), issuing a Gazette in December last year announced respective District Secretaries or Government Agents have been appointed as Returning Officers while Deputy Commissioners or Assistant Commissioners of Elections have been named Assistant Returning Officers of respective districts.

The three stages are: Stage I – Through Executive and Administrative Actions retaking of the functions wrongfully taken over by the Centre over a span of more than 30 years as well as the taking over of functions wrongfully withheld by the Centre. This could be done through Executive and Administrative means and Stage II – Amending Certain Acts of Parliament: Amending certain provisions of the Provincial Councils Act No. 42 of 1987 and provisions of certain Acts, mainly that were enacted prior to the passing of the 13th Amendment, to be in line with the spirit embodied in the provisions of the 13th Amendment. Stage III – Amendment to the Constitution: Necessary Constitutional Amendment to remove the ambiguity in certain provisions of the 13th Amendment and to make clearly defined allocation of subjects, and limits on the exercise of legislative, executive, judicial and fiscal powers by the different layers of government. Emphasising the significance of the 13A, he noted in the letter dated 5 January, that in the Provincial Council Elections held in the Eastern Province twice and the Northern Province once, except for the elections held for the first time for the merged North-East Province in 1988, all political parties participated and the people voted overwhelmingly with enthusiasm. “It demonstrates their willingness to accept the system. People in the remaining provinces are also accustomed to the system, and there is no opposition to its continuation.” He said implementing the 13A in full is the step forward to resolve the political aspirations of the Tamils and his Party has been consistent in this stand for a long period of time. The Indo-Lanka Agreement and the 13th Amendment to the Constitution are the outcomes of the longstanding struggle of the Tamils for a power-sharing mechanism in the areas of their habitation, he underlined. “More than three decades of our experience with the Provincial Councils system is that unless the obstacles and bottlenecks, due to constitutional ambiguity which stand in the way of full implementation of the 13th Amendment are removed, effective implementation of the 13th Amendment is not possible,” he further said. “It is a widely accepted axiom that the essence of the law lies in its spirit. Even the limited extent of devolution envisaged by the 13A has been difficult to realise, with a glaring disparity between what is provided in the text of the Constitution and how those provisions are implemented. Implementing the 13A in a meaningful manner devoid of constant central intrusion into its realm of functions is crucial if it is to serve as a means of dealing with diversity and pluralism within a united country. In the absence of clearly defined allocation of subjects, and limits on the exercise of legislative, executive, judicial and fiscal powers by the different layers of government, particularly between the Centre and the Provincial Councils, implementing the 13A in full would be a futile exercise,” he added.

It has been said the current monthly egg production in the country has decreased to 30 million, due to a lack of animal feed as well as a reduction in the annual import of mother hens from 80,000 to 40,000. Although 80,000 hens were imported each year, the number dropped to 40,000 in the previous year, affecting egg and poultry meat production. As a result, importing mother hens may cause egg production to be delayed by 11 months. As an alternative, Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera has advised the Ministry of Agriculture’s Livestock Development to take steps to import 200,000 hatching eggs. The Department of Animal Production and Health has already prepared the necessary basic activities and the procedure for obtaining mother birds from imported bred eggs will be implemented using the Livestock Development Board’s two hatcheries located at the Miriswatta and Marawila farms. The importation of hatched eggs has now been transferred to the National Livestock Development Board and private sector institutions, with the Livestock Development Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Animal Production and Health providing the necessary facilities. “Although we have been self-sufficient through egg and poultry production in the past, with the ban on chemical fertiliser in 2021, the lack of fodder has severely affected the decline in animal production due to the drop in maize production to 40 per cent. Our country’s annual egg requirement is approximately 2,990 million. The monthly egg requirement is between 249 and 250 million. However, it has now dropped to 30 million. If these bred eggs are imported before the end of February, the production of eggs in this country can be brought to a high level by next May and June,” the officials in charge of the Livestock Development Division pointed out."

Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando said yesterday (09).  Fielding questions at a media briefing, he said that it was high time that Sri Lankans thought ‘out of the box’ and not vote for a one single party based on their ancestral affiliations to .that party and its colour. “Do not think of personal gain,” he urged noting that things were made even more  easy when making a decision as those who contest are those from one’s own area. People tend to know who the criminal is and who the corrupt person is, he said. Therefore it is up to the people not to vote for political parties that have been unable to cleanse themselves of those with records of criminal and corrupt actions, Fr. Fernando said urging the public to set aside party politics to ensure that the people do not continue to suffer as a result of the local government they appoint.      By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Jayasekara in his statement alleged that Bandaranaike, speaking to the media on Sunday, had held Sirisena responsible for the Easter Sunday terror attacks which took place when Sirisena was President. The General Secretary said that Bandaranaike had made this accusation at the 124th Birth Anniversary Commemoration Ceremony of the founder leader of the SLFP S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike held at Galle Face, Colombo, near his statue. Jayasekara said that Kumaratunga was President from November 1994 to November 2005. During this 11-year period a number of LTTE terror attacks took place killing several civilians and maiming scores of others, whilst causing damage to public property. A few of those attacks was the destruction of the Kolonnawa oil tanks in 1995, attacks on the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in 1996, attacks on a train carrying civilians in Dehiwela, attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Dalada Maligawa and an attack on her, herself, where she lost an eye. If her argument, that Sirisena is responsible for the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks hold water, in the same vein, Chandrika Bandaranaike should be held responsible for the several LTTE attacks that took place during her tenure of office, Jayasekara said.  (PA)"

In a statement issued on Sunday, eminent economists and scholars world over observed that amid Sri Lanka’s crucial debt negotiations, “all lenders — bilateral, multilateral, and private — must share the burden of restructuring, with assurance of additional financing in the near term.”  However, Sri Lanka cannot ensure this on its own, they noted. “It requires much greater international support. Instead of geopolitical manoeuvring, all of Sri Lanka’s creditors must ensure debt cancellation sufficient to provide a way out of the current crisis,” the statement said.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

IMF in their new forecast also expected consumer prices to rise by 29.5 per cent this year, as opposed to its previous forecast, where it said that consumer prices are expected to increase by 48 per cent, Year-on-Year, this year.

CBSL further said on Wednesday that measures are underway to secure financing assurances from official creditors for the debt restructuring process aimed at ensuring medium-term public debt sustainability. With significant progress being made at present in relation to the interaction with the Sri Lankan creditors, the envisaged IMF facility is expected to materialise in early 2023, it added.

Seven areas – trade in goods, trade in services, investment, rules of origin, customs cooperation, trade facilitation, and economic cooperation will be the focus of the negotiations. The start of the negotiations will take place against the backdrop of a significant trade imbalance in Thailand’s favour. In 2021, Sri Lanka imported goods from Thailand worth USD 355 million, but only sent USD 59 million to Thailand. Thus, from Sri Lanka’s perspective, the negotiations will be aimed at enhancing access to our exports not only in the Thai market, but also in markets in other ASEAN countries through Thailand’s gateway and lowering present non-tariff trade obstacles. According to market potential assessments, Sri Lankan exports of precious stones, black tea, and other goods are promising. Sri Lanka is hopeful that through discussions, doors will open to offer opportunities in both new industries and for the two nations’ present trade frameworks. The National Trade Negotiating Committee (NTNC), whose members primarily represent the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Commerce, and Food Security, the Department of Trade and Investment Policies of the Treasury, and the Department of Commerce, will participate in the negotiations on behalf of Sri Lanka under the leadership of K.J. Weerasinghe, Chief Negotiator, and the Presidential Secretariat. The Government plans to effect this agreement in the first quarter of 2024. The NTNC will give the specific requests made by the regional business associations/chambers considerable consideration during the negotiations. The Government’s objective of entering the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which represents 30 per cent of the global population and economy, will be advanced by this agreement. As trade is a growth tool that is relevant to both countries, the Government of Sri Lanka is eager to strengthen bilateral relations with Thailand. Thailand and Sri Lanka have formal diplomatic relations that date back 68 years, and Thailand’s economy was boosted by the rapid growth of manufactured exports. "

In 2021, Sri Lanka earned USD 506.9 million from tourism. However, when considering Sri Lanka’s highest ever tourism earnings witnessed to date, a figure of USD 4,380.6 million four years ago in 2018, last year’s tourism earnings were less by 285.51 per cent (USD 3,244.3 million). Meanwhile, tourist arrivals last year grew by 270.2 per cent (194,495) YoY to 719,978, data further showed. In 2021, tourism arrivals numbered 194,495. However, the highest number of tourist arrivals the country has witnessed to date was in 2018 where tourist arrivals numbered 2,333,796. Therefore, tourist arrivals last year over 2018 fell by 224.15 per cent (1,613,818). Tourism was Sri Lanka’s third highest foreign exchange earner for seven consecutive years from 2013 to 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the industry in 2020, relegating it to the seventh place that year and to the eighth place in the following year 2021, according to latest CBSL data. At present, tourism is hit by political instability and record power cuts which had its beginnings in 2021 and still continues because of Sri Lanka’s lack of US dollars to import coal and thereby ensure that the country has uninterrupted power 24 hours of the day.

IMF in their new forecast also expected consumer prices to rise by 29.5 per cent this year, as opposed to its previous forecast, where it said that consumer prices are expected to increase by 48 per cent, Year-on-Year, this year. Meanwhile, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on Wednesday, without giving any forecasts for this year, has however said it is expected to record a gradual recovery from the second half of this year (2023) and sustain the growth momentum beyond. CBSL estimated that the economy would have shrunk by around eight per cent last year (2022). The economy grew by 3.7 per cent in 2021, according to the CBSL. CBSL further said on Wednesday that measures are underway to secure financing assurances from official creditors for the debt restructuring process aimed at ensuring medium-term public debt sustainability. With significant progress being made at present in relation to the interaction with the Sri Lankan creditors, the envisaged IMF facility is expected to materialise in early 2023, it added. CBSL has presently reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF for the disbursement of a total of USD 2.9 billion, to be given out to the country in tranches, spread over a four-year period. But a precondition for this disbursement is that Sri Lanka’s creditors should unanimously agree to restructure its debt. At present, China is pussyfooting in restructuring the debt owed to it by Sri Lanka, thereby delaying the disbursement of IMF money. By Paneetha Ameresekere"

Ratnayake told the media that the decision on the electricity tariff revision was supposed to be made last week, but it was not taken up at the Cabinet meeting and was postponed until next Monday. He said the PUCSL urged Cabinet not to make any decisions regarding the revision of electricity tariffs based on false information. “Even if Cabinet makes the decision, the PUCSL will not approve it because we have the authority vested under the provisions,” he said. Therefore, the PUCSL Chairman urged the public not to panic over the tariff increase, and stated that the PUCSL will not approve any tariff increase at this time. “The data provided to Cabinet was not based on accurate information, data, or proper procedures,” he said. He said if it had been discussed at the Cabinet meeting, a decision would have been made based on these facts and figures. “After seeing that the CEB is making operational profits and taking into account the raw materials used to generate electricity, the PUCSL approved a tariff increase four months ago,” he said. “There is no need for a revision at this moment as the CEB is making reasonable profits,” he added.

The Bill was scheduled to be debated yesterday (5). Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe told the House that the Government will not withdraw the Bill and this is only a postponement. The Bureau of Rehabilitation Bill sparked controversy over several provisions such as Section 28 (2) where persons employed at the Centres for Rehabilitation “to preserve order and discipline” may use all means “including minimum force as may reasonably be necessary to compel obedience to any lawful directions.” Opposition MPs, human rights activists and civil society organisations raised concerns the Bill which is “to provide for the establishment of a bureau to be called and known as the bureau of rehabilitation; to regulate its powers, duties and functions and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto” can be used to suppressanti-government protesters. The Supreme Court has determined that a controversial rehabilitation bureau bill is, as a whole, inconsistent with Article 12 (1) of the Constitution and may therefore be enacted only by special majority. On 20 October 2022, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena informed Parliament that the bill, titled ‘Bureau of Rehabilitation Act’ may be enacted by special majority as required by Article 84 (2) of the Constitution. Article 12 (1) of the Constitution reads: “All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law.” The Supreme Court determined that the inconsistency with Article 12 (1) will cease if all references to ‘ex-combatants,’ ‘violent extremist groups,’ and ‘any other group of persons’ are deleted from the bill, and if the bill is limited to rehabilitation of drug dependent persons and such other persons as may be identified by law.

He said the proposed electricity tariff revision was based on inaccurate information gathered from a presentation given by the new CEB General Manager, another senior engineer, and the Ministry Secretary. Ratnayake told the media that the decision on the electricity tariff revision was supposed to be made last week, but it was not taken up at the Cabinet meeting and was postponed until next Monday. He said the PUCSL urged Cabinet not to make any decisions regarding the revision of electricity tariffs based on false information. “Even if Cabinet makes the decision, the PUCSL will not approve it because we have the authority vested under the provisions,” he said. Therefore, the PUCSL Chairman urged the public not to panic over the tariff increase, and stated that the PUCSL will not approve any tariff increase at this time. “The data provided to Cabinet was not based on accurate information, data, or proper procedures,” he said. He said if it had been discussed at the Cabinet meeting, a decision would have been made based on these facts and figures. “After seeing that the CEB is making operational profits and taking into account the raw materials used to generate electricity, the PUCSL approved a tariff increase four months ago,” he said. “There is no need for a revision at this moment as the CEB is making reasonable profits,” he added.

Thereafter, the Bill should be referred to Cabinet. After Cabinet approval is granted, the Bill is presented to Parliament to be included in the Order Book. This is the standard procedure with regard to a Private Member’s Bill. I would like to ask if the Government is following this procedure.” Dissanayake said, if six months has elapsed since presenting the Bill to Parliament, there is no need to present it to Cabinet. “However, in this case six months hasn’t elapsed. So a ministerial report has been presented. Therefore, this has to go to Cabinet along with the report,” he pointed out. The JJB Leader said the Election Commission has already announced the nomination dates and the political parties are preparing to submit their nominations. “This Bill has been presented to introduce a youth quota in nominations. If the Bill is passed before the nominations are called, there might be issues in submitting and accepting nominations and it could lead to a delay of holding the election,” he said.

Speaking at the media briefing, actor Chaminda Jayasuriya said a political solution to the environmental problem is required, and that Sri Lanka has not paid significant attention to the environmental problem for the past 74 years.

It is his right to follow a religion or not. However, he does not have the right to insult a belief of those who follow a religion. Therefore, we will take legal action against this person,” he said.

He said, right now the Government is trying to postpone the election through a judicial process. Speaking to the media yesterday (4), he said according to the Government’s plan, the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance will go to Court and declare that there is insufficient money to hold an Election. The Election Commission (EC) will announce the dates of the Election soon, and in the meantime, a State official has petitioned Court to prevent the LG Election from taking place.  “If there is no such plan to postpone the Election, why would the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance become a respondent in the case? This drama is irrational because the Government’s lack of funds cannot be presented to Court. Furthermore, the Government has printed money at the rate of Rs 3 billion per day throughout  2022. That is, if the EC receives three days’ worth of funds, the Election can be held. That is why we ask the Government to hold the Election rather than act like there isn’t enough money,” he said. He said, the Government now has another trump card: postponing the Election by changing the Election Law before Nomination Day. He said, that if such a Bill is presented to Parliament, it will undoubtedly be challenged in Court. “The Court has already decided that in order to postpone an Election, the consent of the people must be taken through a referendum. To escape from this, the Government can avoid going to Court by amending Election Laws. A Bill amending the Election Law to give youth 25% of nomination opportunities is in the Order Book. The deadline to challenge the Bill in Court has expired now. This Bill can be debated in Parliamentary Committees, and a provision can be inserted in the draft to postpone the Election,” he said.

CBSL has presently reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF for the disbursement of a total of USD 2.9 billion, to be given out to the country in tranches, spread over a four-year period. But a precondition for this disbursement is that Sri Lanka’s creditors should unanimously agree to restructure its debt.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh yesterday (4) said Governments must base their decisions on ‘science facts’ rather than ‘science politics’.” China announced it will reopen its border to international travellers on 8 January 2023, after the country made an abrupt U-turn on its Covid-19 containment policies. Countries including the US, Japan, India and Italy has already announced mandatory Covid testing on visitors from China as the coronavirus spread after China eased Covid-19 rules. His warning comes as Chinese tourists travelling in the backdrop of Covid-19 spread in China. He said several countries are introducing Covid-19 testing and other measures for travellers from China, even though the virus is already circulating widely within their borders. It is extremely disappointing to see this knee-jerk reinstatement of measures that have proven ineffective over the last three years. Research undertaken around the arrival of the Omicron variant concluded that putting barriers in the way of travel made no difference to the peak spread of infections. At most, restrictions delayed that peak by a few days. If a new variant emerges in any part of the world, the same situation would be expected.  That’s why governments should listen to the advice of experts, including the WHO, that advice against travel restrictions. We have the tools to manage Covid-19 without resorting to ineffective measures that cut off international connectivity, damage economies and destroy jobs.

Speaking to the media at the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) yesterday (4), Dr. Ginige said, “no country can stop the virus from entering a 100 per cent owing to globalisation, the only way to prevent another surge would be obtaining the Covid-19 vaccine.” The new Omicron sub-variant – BF.7 has mostly affected the Western Pacific region. “It would be almost impossible to prevent a new or more lethal variant or sub-variant from entering the country. But it would be easier to prevent the pandemic from reaching epidemic proportions should timely action be taken,” he observed. Fielding questions, he said there is no risk to the country at present from the new sub-variant, therefore it is important to take the necessary vaccine doses to prevent another surge of the viral infection. However, any decision with regard to an increase in testing or any other related decision would have to be taken in consultation with relevant stakeholders, he said.   Dr. Ginige said primary Covid vaccination had been completed by October 2021. However, from the 14.2 million over 20s population, only 8.1 million obtained the first booster dose. There are over 6 million more persons to obtain the primary booster dose. He said while conducting research on the new BF.7 sub-variant, even the World Health Organization (WHO) had issued instructions for the booster dose to be administered to those who had not received even a single of the booster doses. Although the Pfizer vaccine expired, the Expert Committee has recommended that the Sinopharm vaccine be administered as the booster, he said. With the above 60 age group being identified as high risk, the Chief Epidemiologist stressed on the need for them to obtain the booster doses as soon as possible. They comprised at least 78 per cent of the Covid deaths in the country. The response was very poor for the Health Ministry’s call for this age group to obtain the second booster as well. Although there were 2.7 million over 60s population, only 200,000 obtained the second booster. He urged those over 60 who also suffered from chronic illnesses to obtain the second booster as soon as possible. Those above 18 years who have not taken a single dose of the Covid vaccine as well as those who have only taken one dose of it should obtain the relevant dose as soon as possible. Dr. Ginige said there were 1.8 million Sinopharm vaccines available to those who have not taken their relevant anti-Covid vaccine dose.

We are aware that the government tried everything to postpone or avoid this election, and the TNA position has always been that timely elections are the bedrock of democracy and should never be postponed or avoided. So, we are pleased that the Elections Commission has gone ahead and announced that the local council elections will be held.” He added that Provincial Councils in the country have not been functioning for some time due to a legal snag, which should be corrected immediately and PC Elections should also be held. “As for the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) the main constituent of the TNA, we have invited our branch organisations to apply for nominations to contest this election, and we will pick the most suitable candidates, giving priority to the youth and women. We have also asked suitable candidates to come forward through their branches at the village and ward levels to our constituency branch, and we will be able to select the right people to contest on our behalf and seek public support he added.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh yesterday (4) said Governments must base their decisions on ‘science facts’ rather than ‘science politics’.” China announced it will reopen its border to international travellers on 8 January 2023, after the country made an abrupt U-turn on its Covid-19 containment policies. Countries including the US, Japan, India and Italy has already announced mandatory Covid testing on visitors from China as the coronavirus spread after China eased Covid-19 rules. His warning comes as Chinese tourists travelling in the backdrop of Covid-19 spread in China. He said several countries are introducing Covid-19 testing and other measures for travellers from China, even though the virus is already circulating widely within their borders. It is extremely disappointing to see this knee-jerk reinstatement of measures that have proven ineffective over the last three years. Research undertaken around the arrival of the Omicron variant concluded that putting barriers in the way of travel made no difference to the peak spread of infections. At most, restrictions delayed that peak by a few days. If a new variant emerges in any part of the world, the same situation would be expected.  That’s why governments should listen to the advice of experts, including the WHO, that advice against travel restrictions. We have the tools to manage Covid-19 without resorting to ineffective measures that cut off international connectivity, damage economies and destroy jobs. Governments must base their decisions on ‘science facts’ rather than ‘science politics’.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Speaking to the media at the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) yesterday (4), Dr. Ginige said, “no country can stop the virus from entering a 100 per cent owing to globalisation, the only way to prevent another surge would be obtaining the Covid-19 vaccine.” The new Omicron sub-variant – BF.7 has mostly affected the Western Pacific region. “It would be almost impossible to prevent a new or more lethal variant or sub-variant from entering the country. But it would be easier to prevent the pandemic from reaching epidemic proportions should timely action be taken,” he observed. Fielding questions, he said there is no risk to the country at present from the new sub-variant, therefore it is important to take the necessary vaccine doses to prevent another surge of the viral infection. However, any decision with regard to an increase in testing or any other related decision would have to be taken in consultation with relevant stakeholders, he said.   Dr. Ginige said primary Covid vaccination had been completed by October 2021. However, from the 14.2 million over 20s population, only 8.1 million obtained the first booster dose. There are over 6 million more persons to obtain the primary booster dose. He said while conducting research on the new BF.7 sub-variant, even the World Health Organization (WHO) had issued instructions for the booster dose to be administered to those who had not received even a single of the booster doses. Although the Pfizer vaccine expired, the Expert Committee has recommended that the Sinopharm vaccine be administered as the booster, he said. With the above 60 age group being identified as high risk, the Chief Epidemiologist stressed on the need for them to obtain the booster doses as soon as possible. They comprised at least 78 per cent of the Covid deaths in the country. The response was very poor for the Health Ministry’s call for this age group to obtain the second booster as well. Although there were 2.7 million over 60s population, only 200,000 obtained the second booster. He urged those over 60 who also suffered from chronic illnesses to obtain the second booster as soon as possible. Those above 18 years who have not taken a single dose of the Covid vaccine as well as those who have only taken one dose of it should obtain the relevant dose as soon as possible. Dr. Ginige said there were 1.8 million Sinopharm vaccines available to those who have not taken their relevant anti-Covid vaccine dose. Meanwhile, Director General of Health Services (DGHS), Dr. Asela Gunawardena, issuing a circular, said the remaining Covid-19 Sinopharm vaccines could be used to strengthen the Covid vaccination campaign. The Health Ministry will use the remaining Sinopharm vaccines to strengthen the vaccination campaign by administering it to those above 18 years including pregnant women to complete primary vaccination against the disease.

As part of the event, the staff with the longest outstanding service was recognised and appreciated for their dedication at JICA Sri Lanka. JICA will continue to support Sri Lanka towards the economic and social development of the country and look forward to celebrate many more years of a relationship with Sri Lanka assuring its assistance towards overcoming the development challenges the country is currently facing, said JICA. Japan’s development assistance in the form of technical cooperation has been provided to Sri Lanka since 1954 and JICA was established in Japan in the year 1974, it added. Since then, JICA as a development partner continues to support the Government of Sri Lanka to implement a range of projects across priority sectors, intensifying the overall growth of Sri Lanka, JICA said. In 1982, JICA Sri Lanka Office was established and among the many commendable joint interventions are infrastructure development for quality growth, rural development for inclusive growth and Social infrastructure development for vulnerability reduction. In 2008, new JICA began operations after the merger with the Overseas Economic Cooperation Operations Department of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). JICA assists and supports developing countries as the executing agency of Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA).

With these new additions the Squadron would render its service to the nation in the future as the leading fighter of SLAF defending national air space. With the endowing effort and commitment of its professional crew under the guidance of its Commanding Officer, the No 10 Fighter Squadron will continue to thrive in future keeping the Sri Lanka Air Force ensign flying high. The No 10 Fighter Squadrons was founded on 5 January 1996 with the induction of six new graceful tailless delta Kfir C2s based at SLAF Katunayake under the command of Squadron Leader Priyantha Gunasinghe. The Squadron was reinforced in  2000 with the arrival of another nine Kfir C2s and C7s enhancing the fleet up to fifteen fighters. The Kfir was developed by Israel as a multirole all weather day night fighter, which satisfied almost all the fighter capabilities of SLAF’s through Battlefield Air Strike, Air Interception, Air Interdiction, Maritime Air strikes with precision and deadly force. At the outset, the No 10 Fighter Squadron was strengthened with four pilots, four engineering officers and seventy technicians, who were trained by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and instructor pilots from Israel Air Force. The present Commander of the Air Force, Air Marshal Sudarshana Pathirana was first Officer Commanding Operations and succeeded as the second Commanding Officer from 7th of June 2000. First batch of pilots included Wing Commander Janaka Wijayathilake (Retd) and Group Captain Sajeewa Hendawitharana (Retd). Kfir was the first aircraft to be inducted to SLAF with a Head Up Display (HUD) and a sophisticated Weapons Delivery and Navigation System (WDNS). In addition to the bombload of 5.4 tons, the Kfir has two 30mm cannon guns inbuilt to suppliment its firepower. The Kfir with its formidable firepower and precision targeting was responsible for neutralizing the greatest number of LTTE strongholds, ammunition dumps, fuel depots, troop concentrations, maritime elements and artillery gun positions effectively reducing the LTTE attrition for ground troops to advance on ground. Since its inception, the Squadron has logged more than 2,800 operational flying hours and has delivered over 3,500 tons of weapons precisely over confirmed enemy targets. Further, with the instigation of precision guided munitions (PGM) Kfirs contributed its effort promptly and effectively, whenever it was called upon with distinction and honour. The results of these efforts were clearly manifested in the nation’s ultimate victory over terrorism in 2009. On 8 March 2009 President Mahinda Rajapaksa recognized the contribution of the squadron by awarding Presidents’ Colours to No 10 Fighter Squadron for its unique and enduring action to eliminate the terrorism, which pestered the Island nation for over three decades."

The modified vessel was made by the Government of Sri Lanka owned Cey-Nor Foundation Ltd. Studies by the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) indicate that the fish quality loss in some harbours is at 60 – 70 percent, FAO further said. Some of the issues contributing to these losses include the lack of an adequate cooling system in multi-day fishing vessels that use weeks-old ice to maintain low temperatures and the captured harvest not being handled or stored properly by fishers, which reduces the quality of the overall harvest and damage the bottom layer of stored fish, it said.  To address this issue, FAO, together with the Ministry and NARA, modified the design of a multi-day fishing vessel as a pilot project to introduce new boat designs that provide an economically viable solution to minimize the quality loss of fish harvests. By reducing the existing post-harvest losses, the investment for the proposed new design can be recovered within 3.5 years, said FAO.  The modified multi-day vessel features a pilot coolant system in fish holds and storage as well as a modified fish holding facility to minimize the physical damage to fish due to overload. The modified vessel was launched at an event in Colombo under the auspices of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda, State Minister Piyal Nishantha de Silva and FAO Assistant Representative for Sri Lanka Nalin Munasinghe. The pilot will be experimented for a month before being available in the market. Fish products are an important source of animal protein for Sri Lanka and the sector contributes about 1.1 percent to Sri Lanka’s GDP, added FAO.  (PA)"

Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardana told the media yesterday (3), that concerns about the conduct of Intelligence Officers were raised after the Easter Sunday Attacks in 2019 as well, and that the shortcomings identified in the Intelligence service in the country are being addressed in several phases. Tamil Nadu Intelligence has sounded an alert to senior Police Officers across the State to mount vigil along the coastal districts and look for Imran and his associate who landed along the Ramanathapuram district coast on 25 December 2022. Kanjipani Imran, wanted for various offences, including murders and criminal intimidation, was arrested in Dubai in 2019 and deported to Sri Lanka. He was in judicial custody till a local Court granted him bail on payment of two sureties, in Rs 5 million. The intelligence services had a specific input from central intelligence agencies and reliable sources that Imran was planning to enter India after his release on bail. The information was that he left the Court in disguise and moved to Talaimannar from where his associates were making arrangements for his infiltration into India. “Imran is a drug kingpin with strong connections with heroin and cocaine suppliers based out of Afghanistan and Pakistan. He is facing several cases in Sri Lanka. On information that Imran would attend a birthday function in Dubai, a special team arrested him there in 2019.

They, therefore, called for the authorities to streamline the import process and not allow importers to act in an ad hoc manner owing to the possibility of avian flu entering the country. GVSA President, Dr. Sisira Piyasiri yesterday (3) said they had worked in collaboration with animal research and investigation institutions for a lengthy period to prevent avian influenza (AI) from entering the country. “Unregulated egg imports could lead to a serious crisis as we run the risk of inviting a dangerous disease like avian influenza,” he warned.  It would also seriously affect the local egg production and poultry industry. At present, Sri Lanka enjoys the recognition of being identified as a country without AI enhancing its abilities of exporting chicken. Also, a large number of jobs which are depending on the egg industry would also be lost as a result of this decision, he said. Informed Veterinary sources said, Sri Lanka was the only Asian country which did not have AI while the disease was endemic in countries like India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. Meanwhile, Chairman of the All Ceylon Chicken Producers’ Association (ACCPA), Ajith Gunasekara said his outfit did not believe that the decision to import eggs at this juncture was timely. Sri Lanka has always been self-sufficient in egg production. And measures were being taken by producers to enhance their production despite the crises facing them at present, he claimed. Therefore, this move by the Government would only hinder the effort being made by the ACCPA and the All Ceylon Egg Producers’ Association (ACEPA) to increase egg production while encouraging those who had abandoned the industry to rejoin and commence production. “Also, there is a serious question as to whether the local egg prices would be able to compete with the cost of imported eggs owing to the high production costs.” Gunasekara warned that this latest move would only discourage egg producers even further from either continuing or rejoining the industry. “Though the Minister of Trade thinks that it is his duty to import eggs even and reduce the cost, the truth is that the local cost of an egg could only be reduced by shrinking production costs and removing the hold which intermediate wholesale dealers have on it,” he said. Egg production in Sri Lanka was affected by the pandemic in 2020, the fertiliser issue, and the present forex crisis. At present, a price of an egg has been raised to between Rs 60-70 in the market, greatly inconveniencing consumers.

According to Finance Ministry reports, if paddy cannot be purchased, there is a risk of the rice market collapsing again. It was also said in this situation, only the private sector will be able to buy rice and farmers will be in a desperate situation, resulting in a rapid price drop. The official also said 800,000 hectares of paddy harvest is expected during the Maha Season, while the Government is expected to purchase three million metric tonnes of paddy from the harvest. It was also said, a sum ofRs 2 billion will have to be spent for the purchase and if an election is held, it will not be possible to use the above sum to purchase rice. Rice harvests, which had dwindled after the ban on chemical fertiliser, have increased rapidly this time, and the Government aims to make the country self-sufficient in rice in the presence of a surplus of rice. The official also claimed if a large sum has to be spent suddenly for an election, the agriculture industry will collapse and the country will return to its previous predicament. The Election Commission has requested Rs 12 billion for the election and the Finance Ministry is of the opinion that the amount may increase."

The resolution for the restructuring of State enterprises was presented to the Parliament by the President, in the interim budget of 2022, as well as in the budget presented for 2023. Accordingly, the State Enterprises Restructuring Unit has already been established under the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies to facilitate the restructuring process of State Enterprises. Some of the entities targeted for restructuring are State-owned companies of which the government is the majority shareholder. Some State-owned enterprises operate as corporations.

Devananda said, there is no point in talking about stale matters. “It is better to focus on tomorrow’s challenges and rebuild the economy in the New Year,” he said. He said, every effort would be made to provide fishermen with sophisticated technology and improve sanitation facilities and security systems at fishery harbours. Minister Devananda added that he has instructed Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation (CFHC) officials to take necessary steps to improve facilities in Tangalle, Kudawella, Suduwella and Puranawella fishery harbours on the Southern Coast. “Most of the fishery harbours on the Southern Coast are very busy and close attention must be paid to sanitation facilities and security systems of those harbours. Many persons use these harbours in the morning hours daily and sanitation facilities must be provided to them while addressing lighting systems at harbour premises,” Devananda added.

Public sector employees started the work for the New Year yesterday (2), amidst cancellation of at least 15 office trains. They took oaths kicking off official work for the New Year, pledging that they will work to make the State sector efficient. Addressing the ceremony, held at the Ministry of Public Administration, to mark the beginning of the New Year yesterday (2), Hapuhinna said he had seen, in some places, public officers surfing social media like Facebook and WhatsApp just after they start work for the day, without caring about the people who come to obtain services from public offices. Therefore, a possibility of issuing a circular on using mobile phones, during office hours, would be considered, Hapuhinna said adding that employees in certain private sector offices have to place their mobile phones in a locker when starting work and they could only get the phones back when leaving the offices. “I would not hesitate to take such decisions, if there is a need for that,” he noted. Meanwhile, addressing the same occasion Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said the country needs efficient projects to uplift the conditions of villages. “The Government has already launched programme on that. To make it a success, your support is much needed,” the Prime Minister said."

It will also stop charging for personal alcohol licences – something residents who want to drink at home must have. Dubai has been relaxing laws for some time, allowing the sale of alcohol in daylight during Ramadan and approving home delivery during the pandemic. This latest move is thought to be an attempt to make the city more attractive to foreigners, in the face of competition from neighbours. The two companies which distribute alcohol in Dubai, Maritime and Mercantile International (MMI), and African & Eastern, said they would reflect the cut in tax for consumers. “Since we began our operations in Dubai over 100 years ago, the emirate’s approach has remained dynamic, sensitive and inclusive for all,” MMI spokesman Tyrone Reid told AP. “These recently updated regulations are instrumental to continue ensuring the safe and responsible purchase and consumption of alcoholic beverages in Dubai and the UAE.” It is not clear if the move, which took effect on Sunday, will be permanent. The Financial Times described the move as a one-year trial, citing “industry executives informed of the decision”. (BBC)"

Furthermore, because of the increase in electricity bills, printing calendars and diaries digitally was expensive and as a result, only a small number of businessmen, who placed orders for printing calendars and diaries for the year 2023, had ordered a small number of calendars and diaries.

The Minister personally visited the two dredgers anchored at the Bandaranaike Quay and also made a special tour on board ‘Hansakawa’ to inspect ongoing development work in the port. The officials and the employees pointed out that ceasing of dredging and sludge removal operations inside the port of Colombo, at a time that a massive development of the port was being carried out, also hindered the calling of lager vessels at the port. After discussions on the matter, the Minister instructed to cover work through temporary training of eight existing port employees as an immediate measure to resume operations of the two vessels. The Secretary to the Ministry of Port, Shipping and Aviation, K.D.S. Ruwanchandra and several high officials of SLPA were present."

He said efforts have been made to blacklist fertiliser companies that fraudulently sell inferior fertilisers and to discontinue purchasing fertiliser from them. He made these remarks while responding to questions from journalists following an inspection visit to the Walahanduwa Agricultural Service Centre. “The National Fertiliser Secretariat inspects fertiliser quality. The District Secretary and agricultural organisations now have full authority to purchase organic fertilisers for the district. It is their responsibility to purchase high-quality fertiliser. A company in the Galle district was distributing organic fertilisers when it was discovered that it was of poor quality. The purchase of fertiliser from that company has been halted and it has been blacklisted,” he explained. In addition, he said fertiliser will not be purchased from that company, and that information has been received that officials are being persuaded to sell substandard fertilisers. He said some fertiliser was brought down and given under Indian loan assistance and World Bank assistance and that in the future, fertiliser prices should be controlled. “The price of fertiliser has not been raised to the point where the farmer can no longer afford it. You can see how many farmers protest for fertiliser if there is no fertiliser. At the moment, there is enough fertiliser to meet the country’s needs,” he said. By Kamal Wijehewa – Galle"

They claimed that in previous years, diaries and calendars were designed and printed in various styles and sizes and that large orders were received by them. However, due to a shortage of paper in the country and an increase in the price of inks used for printing, the cost of printing calendars and a day books had increased fivefold, when compared to last year. As a result, printers claim that the business community did not place orders for calendars and day books for 2023. Furthermore, because of the increase in electricity bills, printing calendars and diaries digitally was expensive and as a result, only a small number of businessmen, who placed orders for printing calendars and diaries for the year 2023, had ordered a small number of calendars and diaries. According to the printers, while in previous years, various major companies and businessmen in the island printed the annual calendar in 12 pages and distributed it to customers, this year some businesses have limited the annual calendar to six pages. The public and private banks provide free calendars to their customers every year, and some of those banks have prepared a calendar for the year 2023 and forwarded the calendar to customers through social media networks.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Last month’s (December 2022) deceleration was aided by food inflation decelerating to 64.4 per cent for the third consecutive month and non-food inflation also decelerating for the third consecutive month, to 53.4 per cent. Colombo inflation, YoY, as at last year end, increased by 57.2 per cent, Census and Statistics Department (CSD) data released on Friday (29 December 2022) showed. Consequently Colombo inflation has been in double digits for 13 consecutive months to last month end (December 2022). Prior to  last month, the last time Colombo inflation was  in double digits, for at least 12 consecutive months, was 14 years and two months ago, where Colombo inflation was in double digits for 32 consecutive months, from June 2006 to January 2009. The period June 2006 to January 2009 was the height of the final phase of the war.

Prior to last month, the last time Colombo inflation decelerated for  at least three consecutive months, was 30 months ago, where from March to June 2022, spanning a total of four consecutive months, inflation decelerated, YoY.  Year 2020 was the era when Covid-19 became a global pandemic, restricting or completely stopping the movement of people, thereby crippling the global economy, hence causing flagging demand and thereby slowing down inflationary pressure. However, the current record high inflationary levels are due to multiple causes led by excessive money printing and record high rupee depreciation, in the context that Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy, made worse by Sri Lanka stopping the repayment of its external debt in April 2022 due to a US dollar shortage, thereby closing the access to international markets for the country. Among some of the commodity price hikes responsible for the YoY rise in food inflation  last month, ie up  by  a minimum of 100 per cent and over only, was the retail price of dried chillies increasing by 176.97 per cent (Rs 1,153.22) to Rs 1,804.85 a kilo;   retail price of an egg up by 105.46 per cent (Rs 26.91) to Rs 52.43; red onions up by 109.98 per cent (Rs 364.97) to Rs 6,906.80 a kg; cowpea up 140.02 per cent (Rs 738.86) to Rs 1,240.26 a kg; the retail price of  a kg of papaw up 137.29 per cent (Rs 221.36) to Rs 382.61a kg; mangoes up 135.26 per cent (Rs 98.50) to Rs 171.32 a kg  and the retail price of a kg of green gram up 143.81 per cent (Rs 721.37) to Rs 1,222.97.

The federal agency also arrested another man, identified as Sanofar Ali, for allegedly taking part in plans to carry out terror attacks in the country. NIA officers, familiar with the developments, said IS member Sheikh Hidayatullah was allegedly in touch with Maulvi Zahran bin Hashim, the mastermind of the deadly Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka on 21 April 2019, that claimed over 250 lives. Both Hidayatullah and Sanofar Ali were arrested from Tamil Nadu, an NIA officer said. “Investigations have revealed that the accused persons had entered into a criminal conspiracy in the interior of forested regions of Asanoor and Kadambur areas of the Sathyamangalam forest, Erode District, in February 2022,” NIA said in a statement. “The meetings were led by previously arrested accused Umar Farooq and participated in by deceased accused Jameesha Mubeen (died in Coimbatore blast), along with Mohammed Azharuddin, Sheikh Hidayatullah and Sanofar Ali, where they conspired to prepare for and execute terror acts.” Jameesha Mubeen, who was questioned by NIA in 2019, for alleged terror links, was charred to death in suspicious circumstances after the LPG cylinder inside a Maruti 800, he was driving, exploded near Kottai Eswaran temple, in Coimbatore’s Ukkadam, on the morning of October 23.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts.

Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

The federal agency also arrested another man, identified as Sanofar Ali, for allegedly taking part in plans to carry out terror attacks in the country. NIA officers, familiar with the developments, said IS member Sheikh Hidayatullah was allegedly in touch with Maulvi Zahran bin Hashim, the mastermind of the deadly Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka on 21 April 2019, that claimed over 250 lives. Both Hidayatullah and Sanofar Ali were arrested from Tamil Nadu, an NIA officer said. “Investigations have revealed that the accused persons had entered into a criminal conspiracy in the interior of forested regions of Asanoor and Kadambur areas of the Sathyamangalam forest, Erode District, in February 2022,” NIA said in a statement. “The meetings were led by previously arrested accused Umar Farooq and participated in by deceased accused Jameesha Mubeen (died in Coimbatore blast), along with Mohammed Azharuddin, Sheikh Hidayatullah and Sanofar Ali, where they conspired to prepare for and execute terror acts.” Jameesha Mubeen, who was questioned by NIA in 2019, for alleged terror links, was charred to death in suspicious circumstances after the LPG cylinder inside a Maruti 800, he was driving, exploded near Kottai Eswaran temple, in Coimbatore’s Ukkadam, on the morning of October 23. The incident took place around 200 metres from a Police patrol. The deceased was registered as the prime accused in the blast case. The State Police had invoked the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the case, which was later handed over to NIA. According to NIA officers cited above, Hidayatullah, who has been propagating IS ideology since 2017, was earlier arrested along with Azharuddin in June 2019. He was released on bail in 2020. Azharuddin, from Ukkadam and leader of Kerala-Tamil Nadu IS module, is currently in jail for the Sri Lanka bombings. All the above accused were inspired by Hashim, who masterminded and executed the Sri Lanka bombings — in which 252 people were killed — and planned to carry out similar attacks in two South Indian States at that time. Prior to the Sri Lanka bombings, Hidayatullah and Hashim were in touch through a Facebook page ‘KhilafahGFX’, according to NIA’s charge sheet filed against Hidayatullah in 2019.  (Hindustan Times)"

It will be able to issue international standard certificates in Sri Lanka, conducting laboratory tests on natural fertilisers, seeds, soil samples, agricultural crops, and intermediates, according to Governor Yahampath. “There are two agricultural research laboratories in Mahailuppalama in the Anuradhapura District and Gannoruwa in the Kandy District. But there is not a single ISO-compliant agricultural research laboratory in Sri Lanka. It is the first time that such a laboratory is being built in partnership with the Industrial Technology Institute,” Yahampath said. The Governor expressed confidence that Sri Lankan agricultural products that are ISO-compliant can reach the international market easily and will get the highest value among the potential customers. “With the construction of the proposed agricultural laboratory, farmers in the North Central and Northern provinces can test their samples. At a time when the country is facing a severe shortage of foreign reserves, farmers can contribute to bring more dollars to the country by exporting their ISO compliant agricultural products. Rather than increasing the loan burden of Sri Lanka, it would be ideal to focus attention on new methodologies. We don’t have enough agricultural technology.

He also said if money is printed and distributed to the middle class to purchase solar panels for offices, factories, public schools, and hospitals, it will be beneficial. “Instead of providing innovative solutions, we reject the Government’s attempt to enrich diesel power generation while shifting the burden on the people,” Gammanpila said. When asked if it Minister of Power and Energy’s statement regarding electricity tariffs was true and that it would put an end to the electricity crisis, Gammanpila answered in the negative. “The majority of electricity was used by factories, hotels, offices, and middle-class homes. If those who use excess electricity were given interest-free loans to purchase solar power systems with a battery to produce the electricity they require, they will stop getting electricity from the national grid.

President Wickremesinghe issued these instructions during an observation tour of United Dairies Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, which belongs to the Ambewela Farm Group, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said. The President has commended the systematic growth achieved by the Ambewela Farm in the dairy production industry, adding that it has set an example for other dairy farms as well. The President also instructed to open this farm for research activities for university students to gain experience in dairy farming. General Manager of the Ambewela Farm Group, Sarath Bandara said the Ambewela Farm is the main centre in Sri Lanka as well as in South Asia which can boast of the highest technical application in dairy production and farming technology. The PMD also said, at present, there are about 1,000 dairy cows at the Ambewela Farm, adding that all activities such as maintaining the dairy cows, providing necessary fodder, weighing, diagnosing diseases and separating them from others are done through an automated system. The cows are milked thrice a day and 40,000 litres of liquid milk is supplied to the market daily. Around 4,500 cows are presently being fed within the entire Ambewela Farm network. While this institution was under the Government before the establishment of the Ambewela Group in 2001, the daily milk production stood at a mere 1,500 litres. The Ambewela Farm system has been working for the last 15 years to create the best dairy cows for Sri Lanka. None of these dairy cows are imported and only a very few male animals are imported once every few years. Further, around one thousand indirect jobs have been created in the process of providing fodder for the animals on this farm. A mechanism is already in place to source the whole maize plant to the Ambewela Farm from farmers after harvesting. The Ambewela Farm has facilities to gather around 25,000 metric tonnes of maize plants annually and store them. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also inspected the 30 acres of abandoned land in the vicinity of the Ambewela Farm which has been identified as a suitable location to grow grass, the PMD added."

The trip was made utilising his personal funds with the best interests of Sri Lankans in mind, Rambukwella said, lambasting those who claimed that his hotel stay was paid for by the Indian pharmaceutical manufacturer.     Speaking to the media at the Health Ministry yesterday (28), Rambukwella said he had acted with good intentions. “Pharmaceuticals cannot be bought like essential food commodities from the market. They have a shelf life. They cannot be stored indefinitely unlike certain parties with vested interests would want people to believe.” “Some persons want the health service to collapse and see people die without medicines,” he added. Rambukwella said he had been concerned with regard to the time it took after the order was placed which had prompted the decision to sanction Cabinet approval to purchase medicinal drugs utilising the remaining funds received through the Indian credit line. According to the agreement, these purchases can only be made from pharmaceutical producers in India. A Cabinet Memorandum was submitted as the medicinal drugs had to be purchased on an unsolicited basis. “However, with all the rumours and claims with regard to the manufacturing practices in India, the Health Ministry deployed one of its Additional Secretaries followed by myself as the Health Minister to check on manufacturing practices,” he said. Fielding questions, the Minister said the Health Ministry owed Rs 15 billion to its suppliers, Rs 16 billion to banks, and another Rs 4 billion to local manufacturers. State hospitals owe another Rs 10 billion to their supply chain. Referring to media reports and to a media briefing conducted by the Education Secretary of the Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Pubudu Jayagoda with regard to local manufacturing of certain medicines, the Minister said although he was ready to give priority to local manufacturers, the medicines that were manufactured were inadequate to cater to the local requirement. Although over 180 tender applications had been submitted, only three pharmaceutical suppliers had been able to cater to the need owing to the present economic drawbacks of the country, he added. A Cabinet Paper was submitted on 25 October regarding pharmaceutical imports from Savorite Pharmaceuticals Private Limited, an Indian manufacturer. However, the Finance Ministry issued an observation paper on 8 November signed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe which stated that approval from two committees is compulsory to initiate the process, since it fell outside procurement. The FSP Education Secretary said another Cabinet Paper had been submitted on 5 December by Rambukwella ignoring the given instruction, choosing Kausikh Therapeutics Pvt. Ltd. as the latest company. However, Minister Rambukwella said the particular company exported a large number of medicinal drugs to several countries including Australia. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The previous record was Rs 3.3678 trillion (Rs 3.37 trillion) which was established on 15 December. However, Tuesday’s MP increase was non-demand pull inflationary, as it was used to settle swaps totaling Rs 257,634.89 million (USD 709.43 million) between Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and GoSL that took place on Tuesday. Conversions are based on the administered value of the official, but benchmark ‘spot’ on Thursday (22 December) which was Rs 363.16 to the US dollar. GoSL’s at least theoretical MP borrowing costs (BCs) decreased by 0.88 per cent(Rs 1,019.08 million) toRs 114,570.53 million on Tuesday, due to buying pressure of Treasury (T) Bills and T-Bonds in secondary market trading because of high yields offered by the same, at the expense of lending to the private sector, the engine of growth. Market shortfall increased for the third second consecutive market day to Tuesday, this time by 1.10 per cent (Rs 4,076 million) to Rs 373,078 million, thereby causing sustained rate pressure. Market was short for a record 318 market days to Tuesday. GoSL’s highest to the 323rd highest FVMP debt has been recorded in the 323 consecutive market days to Tuesday. GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs 3 trillion for a record consecutive 118 market days to Tuesday due to a persistent lack of revenue. Swaps between GoSL and CBSL are foreign reserves-neutral. CBSL which administers daily ‘OMO’ lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T-Bill and T-Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL. GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T-Bills and T-Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot.’ The ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and to lower the cost of energy imports which are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee, as Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy.

The previous record was Rs 3.3678 trillion (Rs 3.37 trillion) which was established on 15 December. However, Tuesday’s MP increase was non-demand pull inflationary, as it was used to settle swaps totaling Rs 257,634.89 million (USD 709.43 million) between Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and GoSL that took place on Tuesday. Conversions are based on the administered value of the official, but benchmark ‘spot’ on Thursday (22 December) which was Rs 363.16 to the US dollar. GoSL’s at least theoretical MP borrowing costs (BCs) decreased by 0.88 per cent(Rs 1,019.08 million) toRs 114,570.53 million on Tuesday, due to buying pressure of Treasury (T) Bills and T-Bonds in secondary market trading because of high yields offered by the same, at the expense of lending to the private sector, the engine of growth. Market shortfall increased for the third second consecutive market day to Tuesday, this time by 1.10 per cent (Rs 4,076 million) to Rs 373,078 million, thereby causing sustained rate pressure. Market was short for a record 318 market days to Tuesday. GoSL’s highest to the 323rd highest FVMP debt has been recorded in the 323 consecutive market days to Tuesday. GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs 3 trillion for a record consecutive 118 market days to Tuesday due to a persistent lack of revenue. Swaps between GoSL and CBSL are foreign reserves-neutral. CBSL which administers daily ‘OMO’ lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T-Bill and T-Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL. GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T-Bills and T-Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot.’ The ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and to lower the cost of energy imports which are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee, as Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy.

CEB statistics also showed that Sri Lanka consumed a total of 34.34 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity on Tuesday.  CEB’s average tariff rate of Rs 16.37 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which the above calculations are based on, are as per Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL’s) 2021 Annual Report, which is the latest of such data available in the public domain.  An 8.72 per cent transmission and distribution loss as per last year’s cost estimates as computed by the CEB is also taken into consideration in the above computation, coupled with a 75 per cent tariff hike which was effective from 9 August. Meanwhile, the breakdown of the 34.34 GWh of electricity generated on Tuesday comprised 11.47 GWh of CEB coal, 14.87 GWh of CEB hydroelectricity, 3.6 GWh of CEB fuel/thermal oil, 2.1 GWh from RE other than CEB hydroelectricity and 2.3 GWh from independent power producers’ (IPP’)/ private sector fuel oil, respectively. According to the CBSL, the cheapest electricity  generation cost to the CEB last year was CEB hydroelectricity at Rs 1.67 a unit of electricity (one kWh of electricity), followed by CEB coal (Rs 10.68), ‘other RE’ (Rs 16.22), IPP fuel oil (Rs 30.35) and CEB fuel oil (Rs 32.03), respectively.  The main driver of CEB hydroelectricity is the Mahaweli which generated 10.07 GWh of electricity and which contributed to 29.32 per cent of total electricity generation on Tuesday.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The official, pointing out that systematic measures have been already taken to solve the current financial crisis, said the results would be reaped by March next year. He said it was not possible to allocate funds for an election in such a backdrop as the programme launched to revive the economy will be interrupted and the economy would take a turn for the worse.  “At present, Rs 93 billion was required for State sector salaries, Rs 26. 5 billion was needed to pay State pensions and Rs 6 billion was needed for Samurdhi allowances.  Apart from this, the Government has to borrow money to pay Rs 3.5 billion as social welfare benefits, Rs 3,000 million for medicine and health services, Rs 2 billion for military rations, Rs 2 billion for fertiliser, Rs 7 billion for fuel, electricity, water and insurance and Rs 3 billion as recurrent expenditure and to settle loans. As the Banks have reduced overdrafts granted to the Government, the only other option was to get money from the Central Bank,” he said. Money needed for an Election should be obtained from the Central Bank and hence escalation of the inflation rate when money is printed cannot be prevented and will affect the people by increasing the existing burden, he said.  “However, it will take at least a year for the economy to stabilise. At present, the economic situation has been relieved to some extent. Due to the concessions given to agriculture and paddy cultivation by the State, a surplus in the paddy harvest has been obtained”, the official added. He said, however, if funds were spent on an Election, another economic collapse was inevitable. “If there is an economic recession in the country again, there is no way the country could revive”, he said. “There is a possibility of borrowing money from Banks once the IMF programme begins to operate by March next year. Additionally, it will take a few more months for the Government to amass benefits through the tax policies,” he added. (NJ)"

He said if electricity tariffs are not raised in accordance with the Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB) requirements, extended power cuts are inevitable. Speaking to the media yesterday (27) at the Ministry of Power and Energy, he also said due to Sri Lanka’s coal crisis and its impact on the Lakvijaya Power Plant in Norochcholai, the electricity tariffs will have to be increased to keep daily power cuts to a minimum. CEB General Manager Rohan Seneviratne, who participated in the media briefing, said a unit of electricity is priced at Rs 29.14 while the production cost is Rs 48.42 per unit. Wijesekera refuted recent claims that electricity tariffs are being raised to recover CEB losses incurred thus far, explaining that the increase is being proposed to generate the required amount of electricity. He added that if tariffs were raised to recover CEB’s losses, they would have to be raised by a much higher percentage. He also said electricity tariffs will undoubtedly be revised in January 2023, with a detailed report due to be submitted at the first Cabinet meeting on 2 January 2023. Several ministers suggested that instead of another tariff hike, an alternative programme should be put in place to minimise the Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB) losses at a Cabinet meeting earlier this month. However, Wijesekera said at the time the present issue could not be resolved and the duration of daily power cuts would have to be increased to at least six hours if electricity tariffs were not raised. Meanwhile, he said plans are underway to provide all places of worship with a free 5 KW solar power unit within the next three months. The project is to be facilitated under an Indian credit line, he said. “A programme will be implemented to provide solar panels to all low-income religious places through the Indian credit line within three months to provide at least a 5 KW solar system free of charge. A majority of religious places use less than 650 units of electricity. After installing the solar system, their electricity bills will be nil,” he said. By Thameenah Razeek"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA.

He said if electricity tariffs are not raised in accordance with the Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB) requirements, extended power cuts are inevitable. Speaking to the media yesterday (27) at the Ministry of Power and Energy, he also said due to Sri Lanka’s coal crisis and its impact on the Lakvijaya Power Plant in Norochcholai, the electricity tariffs will have to be increased to keep daily power cuts to a minimum. CEB General Manager Rohan Seneviratne, who participated in the media briefing, said a unit of electricity is priced at Rs 29.14 while the production cost is Rs 48.42 per unit. Wijesekera refuted recent claims that electricity tariffs are being raised to recover CEB losses incurred thus far, explaining that the increase is being proposed to generate the required amount of electricity. He added that if tariffs were raised to recover CEB’s losses, they would have to be raised by a much higher percentage. He also said electricity tariffs will undoubtedly be revised in January 2023, with a detailed report due to be submitted at the first Cabinet meeting on 2 January 2023. Several ministers suggested that instead of another tariff hike, an alternative programme should be put in place to minimise the Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB) losses at a Cabinet meeting earlier this month. However, Wijesekera said at the time the present issue could not be resolved and the duration of daily power cuts would have to be increased to at least six hours if electricity tariffs were not raised. Meanwhile, he said plans are underway to provide all places of worship with a free 5 KW solar power unit within the next three months. The project is to be facilitated under an Indian credit line, he said. “A programme will be implemented to provide solar panels to all low-income religious places through the Indian credit line within three months to provide at least a 5 KW solar system free of charge. A majority of religious places use less than 650 units of electricity. After installing the solar system, their electricity bills will be nil,” he said. By Thameenah Razeek"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/12/28/imfs-tax-free-threshold-more-cognisant-of-poor/,IMF’s tax-free threshold more cognisant of poor,Author not found,0,2022-12-27T20:30:00+00:00," IMF’s tax-free threshold in its personal income tax (PIT) proposals for Sri Lanka appears to be more cognisant of the poor than President and Finance Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s PIT rates, as spelt out in his recent Budget 2023 proposals, which was passed by Parliament earlier this month. As per Wickremesinghe’s ‘Budget 2023,’ the PIT tax-free annual income threshold is a mere Rs 499,999.99, whereas the IMF, in an upload made on its Sri Lanka website on Friday recommends that the PIT tax-free threshold should be “upped” by Rs 100,000 (Rs 100,001) to Rs 600,000. As per Wickremesinghe’s Budget 2023, the new PIT rates effective from April will be a six per cent tax rate on the first Rs 500,000 accruals (monthly income of Rs 41,667 in the 12 months beginning in April 2022 and ending on 31 March 2023), where the annual tax-free threshold will be Rs 499,999.99. A further 12 per cent tax rate on the next Rs 500,000 annual income, 18 per cent on the next Rs 500,000, 24 per cent on the next Rs 500,000 income slab, 30 per cent on the following slab and a flat rate of 36 per cent in the balance, respectively. On the other hand, the IMF recommendation, uploaded on its Sri Lanka website on Friday suggests that PIT increases should be in the form of an annual tax-free allowance up to Rs 600,000. Between Rs 600,001 and Rs 1.2 million (next Rs 600,000) a 10 per cent PIT, next Rs 600,000, 20 per cent and for the balance a flat rate of 30 per cent, respectively, it said. “Based on Sri Lanka’s household income distribution, we estimate that this hypothetical marginal PIT rate schedule would be strongly progressive, imposing an estimated 82 per cent of the tax burden on households in the top 10 per cent of the income distribution, and none on those in the bottom 60 per cent,” IMF said. “Based on Sri Lanka’s relative revenue performance, we estimate that adopting a marginal PIT rate schedule broadly in line with those of its comparators would raise PIT revenue by an additional 0.2 per cent points of GDP, up from its 2020 level of 0.3 per cent of GDP,” it added. The above IMF recommendations are found on a study titled ‘Sri Lanka: Selected Issues’ dated 11 November, but released on its website only on Friday (23). By Paneetha Ameresekere"

He said steps will be immediately taken to remove all buildings that are blocking the waterways and that if this is not done, the city will be destroyed soon. He was speaking during a discussion on the Kandy disaster situation, at the Kandy District Secretariat yesterday (26).

Senanayake noted that no matter how much rain falls in Kandy, such destruction has never occurred, and that some politicians should be held directly responsible for this destruction. He emphasised that there are many unauthorised constructions in Kandy, and as a result, many avenues to drain the water are blocked. The mayor also pointed out that, as a result of the floods caused by unauthorised constructions, the city council is being held accountable by those who carried out the unauthorised constructions.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/12/27/sri-lanka-is-finally-back-on-the-holiday-map-daily-mail/,Sri Lanka is finally back on the holiday map – Daily Mail,Author not found,0,2022-12-26T20:50:00+00:00,"Mary Wales of the Daily Mail has urged British tourists to visit Sri Lanka as the nation is providing great holiday packages at low costs.  According to Mary Wales, seldom has so little money been spent by so few to gain so much luxury as Sri Lanka now offers. Full article: “With the British Government now giving a green light for travel to the country, tourists are being offered unprecedented bargains following the almost total tourism shutdown earlier in the year due to fears about riots and food shortages. Those fears appear to have been over-stated and short-lived. I have just spent two weeks in Sri Lanka, a country I have always loved and was amazed by what I found. As one tourist chief put it: “This is the only country in the world which deals with revolutionary anger through flowers, friendliness and good nature.” Indeed, the friendliness is perhaps even more evident than before the corrupt government began to destroy the economy. What’s more, Sri Lankans are delighted Britain has its first British Asian Prime Minister. “We hope Rishi comes here and that he sends us more tourists,” said the manager of Lakshmi Jewels, a boutique in Galle, the delightful former Portuguese Fort town 40 miles west of Tangalle. It’s certainly easier to come here compared with India, where UK citizens now need three weeks and must turn up in person at a consulate to get a tourist visa. To enter Sri Lanka, you get your digital visa in 36 hours. Go now and you’ll find many hotels are near empty, most running at 10 per cent occupancy, but bookings are slowly rising. The most luxurious hotel in the south of Sri Lanka, the Peace Haven Anantara, near Tangalle, heroically kept on its 340 staff including sushi and Italian chefs. Peacocks still parade on its lawns and giant monitor lizards soak up the sun. You can bag a room here for around £239 a night in January and February. Tangalle’s glorious beaches are deserted. Small bars offer grilled lobster for £15. It is an incredible bargain time for Western travellers. The cost of a shirt being tailored at Numesh Tailors is £3; a pair of linen trousers at Sanu Fashion costs £9. Fresh papayas and pineapples are offered as complimentary desserts. But there’s no question that many hotels and shops are struggling. Some guest houses have closed. In Galle, there is a trail of motley backpackers with only a few higher-spenders hitting the shops or the somewhat eccentric maritime museum. The hunger for tourists is intense even in this laidback seaside town. Delicious curry and a Lion beer is just £10 at The Spice Chest restaurant. The Amangalle, the chic boutique-chain hotel with its white-uniformed staff, has dropped rates by as much as 30 per cent off its peak time prices. Jenny Hope, a retired teacher from Sheffield is a rare British middle-class traveller, enjoying her £40-a-night room at the Parawa guest hotel. ‘I can get a thali meal for £8 and a ten minute tuk-tuk taxi for £1. It is safer and sunnier than any town I can name in Yorkshire,’ she says. Sri Lanka always offers unlimited sunshine and friendliness. And there’s wildlife, too. After two days of spa and sand at the Peace Haven hotel, we headed to Yala national game park on the south-east coast hugging the Indian Ocean, near Hambantota. To seek the rare indigenous leopards is like visiting Kipling’s Jungle Book with its dense green terrain, waterholes where elephants, wild boars and peacocks cool down, and trees where monkeys chatter and swing. And, at the moment leopards outnumber tourists. Before flying back from the capital, Colombo, we stayed a night at The Wallawwa Hotel, just 15 minutes from the airport. This peaceful country house is the perfect antidote to airport hell. Rooms are going for £180 per night, which is a little bit more than pre-pandemic because taxes have risen due the economic crisis, but it’s still lower than in comparable hotels in places such as Mauritius. Sri Lanka needs tourism like never before. Its people are suffering. The good news is that the Foreign Office no longer advises against visiting this beautiful country and Sri Lanka has dropped all its Covid-19 restrictions for arrivals from overseas. My advice is to get there sooner rather than later.”"

During the investigation, a person who impersonated a young girl had communicated with the victim via mobile phone, and obtained his personal pictures. The suspect then demanded money and pre-paid phone cards from the victim. It has been discovered from the statements obtained from the father of the deceased, the student had given the money to the suspect after stealing his father’s money, which was earned by selling betel nuts. Police also found many scratched prepaid cards hidden in the student’s room.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Full article: “With the British Government now giving a green light for travel to the country, tourists are being offered unprecedented bargains following the almost total tourism shutdown earlier in the year due to fears about riots and food shortages. Those fears appear to have been over-stated and short-lived. I have just spent two weeks in Sri Lanka, a country I have always loved and was amazed by what I found. As one tourist chief put it: “This is the only country in the world which deals with revolutionary anger through flowers, friendliness and good nature.” Indeed, the friendliness is perhaps even more evident than before the corrupt government began to destroy the economy. What’s more, Sri Lankans are delighted Britain has its first British Asian Prime Minister. “We hope Rishi comes here and that he sends us more tourists,” said the manager of Lakshmi Jewels, a boutique in Galle, the delightful former Portuguese Fort town 40 miles west of Tangalle. It’s certainly easier to come here compared with India, where UK citizens now need three weeks and must turn up in person at a consulate to get a tourist visa. To enter Sri Lanka, you get your digital visa in 36 hours. Go now and you’ll find many hotels are near empty, most running at 10 per cent occupancy, but bookings are slowly rising. The most luxurious hotel in the south of Sri Lanka, the Peace Haven Anantara, near Tangalle, heroically kept on its 340 staff including sushi and Italian chefs. Peacocks still parade on its lawns and giant monitor lizards soak up the sun. You can bag a room here for around £239 a night in January and February. Tangalle’s glorious beaches are deserted. Small bars offer grilled lobster for £15. It is an incredible bargain time for Western travellers. The cost of a shirt being tailored at Numesh Tailors is £3; a pair of linen trousers at Sanu Fashion costs £9. Fresh papayas and pineapples are offered as complimentary desserts. But there’s no question that many hotels and shops are struggling. Some guest houses have closed. In Galle, there is a trail of motley backpackers with only a few higher-spenders hitting the shops or the somewhat eccentric maritime museum. The hunger for tourists is intense even in this laidback seaside town. Delicious curry and a Lion beer is just £10 at The Spice Chest restaurant. The Amangalle, the chic boutique-chain hotel with its white-uniformed staff, has dropped rates by as much as 30 per cent off its peak time prices. Jenny Hope, a retired teacher from Sheffield is a rare British middle-class traveller, enjoying her £40-a-night room at the Parawa guest hotel. ‘I can get a thali meal for £8 and a ten minute tuk-tuk taxi for £1. It is safer and sunnier than any town I can name in Yorkshire,’ she says. Sri Lanka always offers unlimited sunshine and friendliness. And there’s wildlife, too. After two days of spa and sand at the Peace Haven hotel, we headed to Yala national game park on the south-east coast hugging the Indian Ocean, near Hambantota. To seek the rare indigenous leopards is like visiting Kipling’s Jungle Book with its dense green terrain, waterholes where elephants, wild boars and peacocks cool down, and trees where monkeys chatter and swing. And, at the moment leopards outnumber tourists. Before flying back from the capital, Colombo, we stayed a night at The Wallawwa Hotel, just 15 minutes from the airport. This peaceful country house is the perfect antidote to airport hell. Rooms are going for £180 per night, which is a little bit more than pre-pandemic because taxes have risen due the economic crisis, but it’s still lower than in comparable hotels in places such as Mauritius. Sri Lanka needs tourism like never before. Its people are suffering. The good news is that the Foreign Office no longer advises against visiting this beautiful country and Sri Lanka has dropped all its Covid-19 restrictions for arrivals from overseas. My advice is to get there sooner rather than later.”"

In a statement issued yesterday (26), Ministry of Agriculture said in order to make rice cultivation successful in the 2022/23 season, the fuel distribution activities had been very successful as per the instructions given by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to provide diesel and kerosene to the farmers without any shortage or inconvenience. “The proposal presented by Minister Amaraweera, to provide fuel in the Maha season without any shortage was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers led by the President. Accordingly, for the distribution of fuel, the Petroleum Corporation and the Ministry of Agriculture appointed one officer each to coordinate these activities. Due to this, there were no reports that there had been any shortage of fuel or any difficulty for the farmers to get fuel from filling stations for their Maha season cultivation activities, which started last September,” the Ministry said. Among the facts revealed in the discussion about the progress of fuel distribution for the cultivation activities in the Maha season, the required 6,600 litres of fuel had been provided to the farmers through 3,559 bowers from last September to the second week of December. Accordingly, fuel has been supplied by 866 bowsers in September, 1587 bowsers in October, 1004 bowsers in November and 102 bowsers by 11 December. Apart from this, 151 bowsers of 6,600 litres of kerosene had also been provided to the farmers for cultivation purposes. Accordingly, 16 bowsers in October, 111 bowsers in November, and 24 bowsers in December had been given to the farmers. Amaraweera said that although there is an economic crisis in the country, the Government has taken steps to provide the necessary facilities to the farmers despite the difficulties in order to make this season a success. He also emphasised that although a large number of people criticised the Government, when there were some problems in providing fuel for cultivation in the last Yala season, it is a pity that nobody, not even farmer organisations, appreciate the measures taken regarding the provision of fuel and fertilisers without any delay or shortage."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/12/27/two-thirds-employed-in-informal-sector-imf/,Two-thirds employed in informal sector – IMF,Author not found,0,2022-12-26T20:30:00+00:00," Informal employment contributed to two-thirds of total employment in Sri Lanka, the IMF, in a publication titled ‘Sri Lanka: Selected Issues’ said. In 2019, about 5.5 million (67 per cent), from a total 8.2 million employed in Sri Lanka, were considered informal, it added. These workers are neither subject to national labour legislations and income tax nor entitled to social protection and employment benefits. They are not registered with the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and Employment Provident Fund (EPF), do not have formal financial accounts, do not have EPF accounts, or such establishments do not have 10 or more employees. An important feature of informal employment in Sri Lanka is that a significant share of workers (0.8 million, nine per cent of total employment or 22 per cent of formal sector employment) have informal contractual relationships while working in formal enterprises, the IMF said. “They work in the formal sector but without contribution to social security programmes,” it added. Informal workers also receive less protection from labour regulations due to gaps in labour legislation and weak law enforcement in the informal sector. Although Sri Lankan labour laws seek to protect all workers, some components of the law exclude informal workers. For example, provisions of the Termination of Employment of Workmen Act (TEWA) and the Payment of Gratuity Act generally apply to enterprises with 15 or more workers. Thus, workers engaged in smaller, informal establishments lack protection and compensation against sudden dismissals by an employer, like in the case of Covid-19, the IMF publication said.  Informal workers also have limited protection since the unemployment and retirement benefits in Sri Lanka rely on payment by the employer at the end of the contract, it said. Workers in informal establishments are also vulnerable due to limited enforcement of labour laws due to their lack of visibility, the IMF said. IMF recommendations to uplift the lot of the informally employed, included immediate mobilising revenue to provide adequate fiscal space to support the poor and vulnerable groups whilst remaining the top priority, this could be complemented by broadening the coverage of social service net (SSN) programmes to include the informal sector and improve targeting, allowing for support to be intensified during a crisis such as Covid-19. Meanwhile, over the medium-term, policies should focus on facilitating a gradual transition from the informal to formal sector to increase productivity, employment protection, and Government revenues. These include investing in human capital, improving business and investment climate, simplifying registrations and regulations for new businesses, simplifying tax payments, reforming labour market and laws, and improving access to finance, the IMF recommended.

In a statement issued yesterday (26), Ministry of Agriculture said in order to make rice cultivation successful in the 2022/23 season, the fuel distribution activities had been very successful as per the instructions given by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to provide diesel and kerosene to the farmers without any shortage or inconvenience. “The proposal presented by Minister Amaraweera, to provide fuel in the Maha season without any shortage was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers led by the President. Accordingly, for the distribution of fuel, the Petroleum Corporation and the Ministry of Agriculture appointed one officer each to coordinate these activities. Due to this, there were no reports that there had been any shortage of fuel or any difficulty for the farmers to get fuel from filling stations for their Maha season cultivation activities, which started last September,” the Ministry said. Among the facts revealed in the discussion about the progress of fuel distribution for the cultivation activities in the Maha season, the required 6,600 litres of fuel had been provided to the farmers through 3,559 bowers from last September to the second week of December. Accordingly, fuel has been supplied by 866 bowsers in September, 1587 bowsers in October, 1004 bowsers in November and 102 bowsers by 11 December. Apart from this, 151 bowsers of 6,600 litres of kerosene had also been provided to the farmers for cultivation purposes. Accordingly, 16 bowsers in October, 111 bowsers in November, and 24 bowsers in December had been given to the farmers. Amaraweera said that although there is an economic crisis in the country, the Government has taken steps to provide the necessary facilities to the farmers despite the difficulties in order to make this season a success. He also emphasised that although a large number of people criticised the Government, when there were some problems in providing fuel for cultivation in the last Yala season, it is a pity that nobody, not even farmer organisations, appreciate the measures taken regarding the provision of fuel and fertilisers without any delay or shortage."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/12/27/two-thirds-employed-in-informal-sector-imf/,Two-thirds employed in informal sector – IMF,Author not found,0,2022-12-26T20:30:00+00:00," Informal employment contributed to two-thirds of total employment in Sri Lanka, the IMF, in a publication titled ‘Sri Lanka: Selected Issues’ said. In 2019, about 5.5 million (67 per cent), from a total 8.2 million employed in Sri Lanka, were considered informal, it added. These workers are neither subject to national labour legislations and income tax nor entitled to social protection and employment benefits. They are not registered with the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and Employment Provident Fund (EPF), do not have formal financial accounts, do not have EPF accounts, or such establishments do not have 10 or more employees. An important feature of informal employment in Sri Lanka is that a significant share of workers (0.8 million, nine per cent of total employment or 22 per cent of formal sector employment) have informal contractual relationships while working in formal enterprises, the IMF said. “They work in the formal sector but without contribution to social security programmes,” it added. Informal workers also receive less protection from labour regulations due to gaps in labour legislation and weak law enforcement in the informal sector. Although Sri Lankan labour laws seek to protect all workers, some components of the law exclude informal workers. For example, provisions of the Termination of Employment of Workmen Act (TEWA) and the Payment of Gratuity Act generally apply to enterprises with 15 or more workers. Thus, workers engaged in smaller, informal establishments lack protection and compensation against sudden dismissals by an employer, like in the case of Covid-19, the IMF publication said.  Informal workers also have limited protection since the unemployment and retirement benefits in Sri Lanka rely on payment by the employer at the end of the contract, it said. Workers in informal establishments are also vulnerable due to limited enforcement of labour laws due to their lack of visibility, the IMF said. IMF recommendations to uplift the lot of the informally employed, included immediate mobilising revenue to provide adequate fiscal space to support the poor and vulnerable groups whilst remaining the top priority, this could be complemented by broadening the coverage of social service net (SSN) programmes to include the informal sector and improve targeting, allowing for support to be intensified during a crisis such as Covid-19. Meanwhile, over the medium-term, policies should focus on facilitating a gradual transition from the informal to formal sector to increase productivity, employment protection, and Government revenues. These include investing in human capital, improving business and investment climate, simplifying registrations and regulations for new businesses, simplifying tax payments, reforming labour market and laws, and improving access to finance, the IMF recommended.

The medicines valued at USD 130,000 (approx. 47 million LKR) were urgently procured by UNICEF with funds raised by Rotary’s global network and alumni through the online donation platform https://lifelinesrilanka.rotary.unicef.org.au “We are happy to present the first consignment of the medicines to the Ministry of Health so that the people of Sri Lanka can be served,” said Jennifer Jones. “Rotary will continue to find ways of supporting the country which is very special. Your country has such wonderful people with smiling faces all the time. We must make sure to save that smile in the future,” she said. This consignment of medicines will support various types of treatment including for women during childbirth, pain management, and hypertension. “The protracted nature of the crisis is stretching vital social services such as healthcare and education. UNICEF is using its procurement and logistics expertise and leveraging its partnerships to deliver lifesaving supplies to families,” said Christian Skoog, UNICEF Representative in Sri Lanka. “Despite some improvements in the economic situation in Sri Lanka, the needs of the most vulnerable children and families remain acute, and we are seeking the support of multiple stakeholders to help sustain and scale up our assistance,” he said. The former President of Rotary International, K.R. Ravindran, and the Rotary Sri Lanka Governor Pubudu de Soyza were also present at the event. Explaining the initiative, past Rotary International President Ravindran said “As 80 per cent of our medical supplies are imported, with foreign currency reserves running out because of the economic crisis, essential medicines are not available, and our healthcare system is close to collapse. Lives are in peril, surgeries are being postponed and children and pregnant women are most at risk. This is the reality, and we must accept it and then find ways to help Sri Lanka. I am glad that the Global president is present to hand over the stocks to the Government of Sri Lanka.” In August this year, Rotary International and UNICEF partnered to raise funds to support the delivery of life-saving medicines, clean drinking water, education materials, and other critical supplies to children and families impacted by the economic crisis across the country."

SKDRF President Cho Sung Lea reprimanded the top invitee, Pasqual, over his late arrival saying that if this delay had occurred in Korea, the person would have been investigated and possibly removed from the position because he would not have been deemed suitable for the position. It happened when the Minister arrived about 30 minute late and the SKDRF President began his lecture by pointing out Pasqual’s delay and irresponsibility. In the video going viral, Lea chastised the Minister by saying when anyone engages in a job, he must be honest. When the boss is around the worker tends to be working but when he leaves, the worker starts to idle. If the promises are not kept, I will not continue working with them said Lea. “What is a lie? When the meeting is at 9 a.m. and if the person concern arrives at 9.30 a.m., it’s a lie. He assured he will come and he did not and his assurance was a lie. Why should I meet a person like that? There is an English saying “don’t let a man who lies even build a toilet for you.  “if someone lies the English people  cut connections with him completely.  If one cannot work properly even for a minute, he is done. In Sri Lanka, lying is like eating rice every day. Lying is common and a regular thing here. Despite my saying, it seems so simple to break promises for Sri Lankans. As Sri Lankans you should be ashamed to hear a foreigner saying this. It has become part of your tradition in Sri Lanka. This has to change and it is an important point. We must be honest and reasonable.  If you have given a responsibly take it up and work on it 100 per cent. When a task is given to you, do it with responsibility. We must be accountable for the work we undertake. The point is that here no one takes the responsibility for the given task. The reason is you have managed to accept it as normal and reasonable.  If I am given a task I will sacrifice my life to complete it with honesty,” he added. He also pointed out Sri Lankans employed in Korea are asked to leave if they idle. If the workers are known to be lazy and idling they lose popularity and the demand to be employed there. “Without doing the work properly, but asking for a pay, does not work. We also should be reasonable. If a person lies to a Korean, that’s the end. There is no pointing in continuing our talks.  The business with him comes to an end. For the last 10 days we have been engaged in a workshop and there should not be a delay of even five minutes. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

President Wickremesinghe arrived in Nuwara Eliya Yesterday (22), and spoke on the solutions to the land problems of Nuwara Eliya people and said he would want to resolve it before 4 February, Independence Day. On the same lines, he also spoke about a cable car project between Pattipola-Boralanda for tourists to see the World’s End. President Wickremesinghe instructed officials during the Nuwara Eliya District Development Committee meeting, held yesterday, to commence construction of a cable car project. Ganesan continued to remind the Government of its stance on the Hill Country Tamils. He further noted that the Government of Sri Lanka has officially decided to evaluate and then recognise the contribution of Indian Origin Hill Country Tamil community to the national economy over the last 200 years since their arrival in 1823.  He said that the TPA, as the major community party, welcomed the Cabinet Memo of President Wickremesinghe. “Next year, 2023, is going to be the 200th anniversary of the arrival of the first generation of Hill Country Tamils of most recent Indian origin, now a Sri Lankan community, to Ceylon. MP Ganesan said further, “realisation of the Sri Lankan State on the need to support the underprivileged Hill Country Tamil community makes us happy, but the economic crisis may not be conducive to provide all livelihood subsidies and other infrastructure allocations needed by these people.  To this, he added that it is a wakeup call and that goes to India also. “Governments of the Indian Union and the State of Tamil Nadu should consider providing monetary assistance and expertise to the Sri Lankan Government to design and conduct affirmative action programmes in the plantations.”  He pointed out that the most underprivileged segments in India are looked after with special reservations, with constitutional provisions.  “It is the vision of Dr. Ambedkar and C.N. Arignar Annadurai towards the marginalised people in India under the concept of Social Justice. We request India to extend the same to our people through the Government of Sri Lanka,” Ganesan said.

Addressing a media briefing, Gammanpila said the increased direct and indirect taxes will come into effect on 1 January 2023, and people will feel the real pressure due to the increased taxes after that. Holding an election when the people are angry would be fatal for the Government, he pointed out. “According to the election law, the Election Commission should announce the local government elections before 9 January 2023. The Election Commission is as interested in holding the election as the Government is in not holding the election,” he explained and added, “We (Sri Lanka) were the first to announce that the IMF facility would be available after March. It is expected that one billion US dollars would be received from the Asian Development Bank and USD two billion from the issuance of Bonds, in addition to the IMF loan. The Government hoped to use the funds to purchase fuel and medicine, thereby alleviating the shortages. It was hoped that the money would be used to stabilise the rupee and lower the cost of goods. They hoped to go to the elections as heroes, but they failed big time.” He went on to say that the Government knows that when none of these things can be done on time, if it has to face an election in the midst of a power outage, a medicine shortage, rising commodity prices, and an increasing tax burden, it will be fatal blow to them. “But, no matter how hard the Government tries, we promise the people that we will not allow the Government to deprive the people of their right to vote,” he said.

He accused Sri Lanka’s leaders of seeking assistance from foreign countries to obtain food and drink like beggars. What is the attitude of this country’s leaders which makes them go begging like this? It is their blameworthy actions that led to this sorry situation in Sri Lanka, the Cardinal claimed.  Cardinal Ranjith said, it is not possible to celebrate Christmas with joy when a majority people in the country were hungry. The United Nations has said that 6.1 million people in Sri Lanka skipped at least one meal due to poverty. Therefore, with Sri Lanka going through such a vulnerable situation, how can the Christian community celebrate and enjoy Christmas this year, he said. Christmas is not all about crackers, food, drink, decorations. What is given is more important than what is received at Christmas, he added.  Ten children with special talents from low-income families in Kalutara were given the necessary facilities to study in the school, and a special financial donation was made to twenty poor families in ten villages of Kalutara.

He met food-insecure communities and heard first-hand accounts of the difficulties they are facing and how USAID and WFP support has helped provide regular meals for their families. During his visit, Shiau met communities from Mullaitivu in the North, who are among those worst affected by the economic crisis – including pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and people with disabilities – to better understand their nutritional needs. This year, the US has provided a record total USD 20 million (approximately Rs 7.3 billion) to support WFP’s response to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka. Of that, USAID’s most recent contribution of USD 13 million (approximately Rs 4.7 billion) is providing cash assistance and food rations to families hard-hit by the economic crisis across the country. USAID also donated funds to WFP to help feed children enrolled in the national school meal programme. “The United States of America is a significant contributor to WFP’s emergency operation in Sri Lanka and the single largest donor to WFP globally,” said Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, WFP Sri Lanka’s Representative and Country Director. “We are immensely grateful for the contribution from USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance which has enabled us to swiftly expand our emergency operation, so we can help more people access regular, nutritious meals. We welcome Shiau’s visit to Sri Lanka where he has witnessed how valuable USAID’s contribution is to food-insecure communities.” According to the latest WFP surveys, seven out of 10 households are adopting negative coping strategies – such as limiting portion sizes or skipping meals altogether – to deal with high food prices and reduced incomes. The US funding comes at a critical time to help safeguard these communities and prevent them from adopting potentially damaging coping strategies. USAID’s long-time support to WFP and the Government of Sri Lanka includes disaster risk reduction initiatives related to floods and landslides. During his visit, Shiau participated in a live demonstration of a mapping exercise in Moratuwa – an area susceptible to weather-related natural disasters – to understand the process by which authorities use Geographic Information System (GIS) software to identify where the most vulnerable communities may be hardest-hit during an emergency. With support from donors like the US, WFP is rapidly scaling up its emergency operation – which commenced in June – with plans to provide food and nutrition assistance to 3.4 million people. WFP has so far reached over one million people with cash, food and vouchers and through the national school meal programme."

Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Thanigaivasan Ratnasingam lamented that doctors will have to pay two months’ salary as taxes if measures were not taken to introduce the proposed amendments. Accordingly, they will only receive 10 months wages. He said, a serious disparity in pay between grades due to the unusually high tax percentage gap between the highest and the lowest wages in the same service will only disrupt the existing National Wage Policy. Dr. Ratnasingam observed that the more serious point is that in a backdrop where salaries had not been increased in the public service to match the price inflation, the purchasing power in the State service will continue to reduce. The Union proposed therefore to raise the levy from Rs 1.2 million to Rs 2.4 million, and increase the annual tax slabs from Rs 500,000 to Rs 600,000. They also proposed a revision to the tax rates ranging from the six per cent to 36 per cent to four per cent to 24 per cent. The Media Committee member said doctors had also proposed that the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) and all other allowances they received be exempted from taxation. He said, the petition also proposed that a maximum limit on percentage of tax levied for professionals following the framework be introduced and not to compare them with profit-making businesses.

Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Thanigaivasan Ratnasingam lamented that doctors will have to pay two months’ salary as taxes if measures were not taken to introduce the proposed amendments. Accordingly, they will only receive 10 months wages. He said, a serious disparity in pay between grades due to the unusually high tax percentage gap between the highest and the lowest wages in the same service will only disrupt the existing National Wage Policy. Dr. Ratnasingam observed that the more serious point is that in a backdrop where salaries had not been increased in the public service to match the price inflation, the purchasing power in the State service will continue to reduce. The Union proposed therefore to raise the levy from Rs 1.2 million to Rs 2.4 million, and increase the annual tax slabs from Rs 500,000 to Rs 600,000. They also proposed a revision to the tax rates ranging from the six per cent to 36 per cent to four per cent to 24 per cent. The Media Committee member said doctors had also proposed that the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) and all other allowances they received be exempted from taxation. He said, the petition also proposed that a maximum limit on percentage of tax levied for professionals following the framework be introduced and not to compare them with profit-making businesses. Dr. Ratnasingam said his outfit had discussed the issue facing all professional categories, with several other professional trade unions including Federation of University Teachers’ Associations (FUTA), CEB Unions Registered Medical Officers Union etc. and were prepared to collaborate with all professionals affected by the unfairness of the Act.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/12/22/to-uplift-hospitality-education-and-bridge-skills-gap/,To uplift hospitality education and bridge skills gap,Author not found,0,2022-12-21T20:30:00+00:00,"To uplift the hospitality education sector in Sri Lanka, the Swiss Hospitality & Management Academy (SHMA) of A. Baur & Co. Pvt Ltd. also known as Baurs, a leading conglomerate with diversified business interests, recently set up a private and public sector partnership with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). The official signing was held on 8 December 2022, at the Embassy of Switzerland in Colombo. The contract exchange took place between Baurs MD and CEO Rolf Blaser and Dr. D. Furgler, Swiss Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives. The Skills for Sustainable Growth (SSG) initiative came about during the height of the pandemic and has seen tremendous participation from both Baurs and SDC. At a time when the hospitality and tourism industry came to a standstill with increasing talent migration, Rolf Blaser discovered the Switzerland-based RIESCO programme and quickly felt fervent of it being a practical and immediate solution in addressing the widening skills gap.  During end last year, officials from Baurs held a briefing with the Swiss Ambassador and introduced SHMA and the various solutions from an educational standpoint. With further discussions earlier this year, Baurs proposed a collaboration opportunity with SDC to localize and implement the RIESCO programme in the country. Bringing Switzerland’s distinctive reputation and quality standards in hospitality education which is one of the best in the world to Sri Lanka is a timely and ideal solution to the country’s tourism and hospitality sector, where hundreds of thousands of livelihoods depend upon, in the backdrop of various ongoing challenges, and eventually contribute immensely to the overall economy, ensuring that a quality pool of talented and employable professionals are created especially among the youth in the rural areas. This will with no doubt minimise the industry’s skills gap, take off the burden on the state, and go on to uplifting the country as a whole Designed by Hotel & Gastro Formation, the RIESCO programme is aimed at migrants entering Switzerland, who are heavily reliant on state welfare system. The programme methodology and content ensure that one completes the programme in the shortest possible time and acquires the necessary skills that are highly employable, translating them into active participants in the hospitality sector and economy. SHMA plans to sustain this programme through advanced digitalisation platform, working with both the public and private sector. Coming under the SSG initiative, this will bring about immense benefits to the learners and country as a whole, in contrast to lengthy and conventional hospitality education programmes in Sri Lanka. By aligning and implementing a Swiss Vocational Skills Development (VSD) curriculum in hospitality management, SHMA will enhance local curriculums throughout the numerous learning centres island-wide. Through its train the trainer programmes, SHMA will go onto further strengthen impactful teaching methodologies. The SSG programme aims to create 2,240 skilled young men and women within three years, with the first batch of student intake of 240 scheduled to take place during July 2023, followed by training 800 students in 2024 and 1,200 students in 2025, including increasing female representation to 40pct from the current industry levels exhibiting below 10pct. This will cover core hospitality operations and soft skills development including hospitality English, grooming and etiquette, and basic IT skills. The Districts will include Jaffna, Trincomalee, Ampara, Puttalam, Kurunegala, Kandy, Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Moneragala, Ratnapura, Batticaloa, Anuradhapura, Hambantota among others, with a drive to also identify potential learning centres within the districts. The certificate programme runs for nine months, with the first six months comprising  70 per cent practical classroom learning and 30 per cent theoretical knowledge, and thereafter take up a three month internship with possible extension to six months. Baurs has already partnered with many hotels in facilitating these internships, with more joining onboard. The programme will pursue a hybrid teaching model where a SHMA faculty member will be placed at each learning centre for six months upon implementation, ensuring that it’s well absorbed and in line with the standards and frameworks of the learning curriculum. The SSG programme will play a key role in minimising the skills gap and enhancing the quality of education through increased female participation, competent talent pool, quality standards in par with global trends, and making Sri Lanka among the best tourist destinations. The inclusion of females and returning workers is a main SDGs of this project, to increase equal employment opportunities and ensure correct and safe employment channels and migration paths. The SSG hospitality certificate provides a stepping stone towards enrolling for Professional Diploma programmes facilitated by SHMA and awarded by École hôtelière de Lausanne EHL, world’s number one hotel management school. SHMA provides world class education through its VET by EHL Professional Diploma programme, available in Culinary, Food and Beverage and Hotel Operations, with the next intake taking place in February and March 2023."

Wickremesinghe said an environment will be created for small and medium-scale industrialists to become successful using modern technology and the Government was ready to empower industrialists as the main stakeholders in earning foreign exchange for Sri Lanka. The President pointed out that instead of looking at the fallen economy and regretting it, everyone should work together to create an environment for a prosperous future. He said Japan and Germany, which were destroyed by World Wars provide ample testimony of how to rebuild the country and the economy. The President added that the industrialists have a great responsibility to rebuild the fallen economy. “Industrialists are a group of people who contributed immensely to the economy,” he said. “We have no option but to increase taxes, but I am confident that we can pull through and we will pull through. We have gone through this earlier. You ran through wars. We have gone through the worst of what has happened this year. We have to pull through and that is where we have to look at all of you. Because we have to preserve what is left. We still have issues. Nevertheless, the Government’s aim is to revive and help as many businesses as possible. Many businesses must survive,” the President added. “The Government focuses on Small and Medium enterprises with economic difficulties, as without these enterprises no one can survive. The Government is going through a series of exercises to correct the economy and uplift small and medium-scale enterprises. Modern technology can be used for that. We should look at the development of small and medium-scale industries in other countries and use modern technology to develop these industries. We are ready to provide all the support we can as a government for that,” he said. The President queried from industrialists as to whether they would like to strengthen the economy with new innovations to win the international market or to remain with the same old methods. He further said with new technology and new innovations, industrialists have a good chance of becoming economically stronger to conquer the world. “For that, we need a change in attitude”, he said. At present the country needs foreign exchange, with increasing foreign exchange, the economy will be strengthened. This enables the Government to allocate more financial assistance to the education and health sectors and to solve problems that have arisen in the field of education and health. The President presented awards to top 10 achievers. The Vice Chancellor of the Jayewardenepura University, Prof. Sudanta Liyanage, Secretary to the Ministry of Industries Thilaka Jayasundara, CNCI Chairman Canisius Fernando and several others participated."

Gunashekharan alias Guna, a resident of Colombo, who was key person in the alleged LTTE revival conspiracy in association with Pakistani national Haji Salim, Pushparajah alias Pookutti Kanna, Mohammad Asmin, Alahapperumaga Sunil Ghamini Fonseaa, Stanly Kennady Fernando, Ladiya Chandrasena, Dhanukka Roshan, Vella Suranka and Thilipan. “The case pertains to activities of a Sri Lankan drug mafia controlled by C. Gunashekharan and Guna and Pushparajah alias Pookutti Kanna, in association with Haji Salim, drug and arms supplier based in Pakistan, which has been operating in India and Sri Lanka in illegal drugs and arms for the revival of LTTE in India and Sri Lanka,” the NIA said in a statement. Haji Salim, according to a counter-terrorism official in Delhi, “runs one of the biggest networks of smuggling drugs and arms from Pakistan to Sri Lanka.” The agency did not describe the role of other arrested persons in the case. The federal anti-terror probe agency has registered at least four cases since last year to probe conspiracy by several LTTE cadres based in India and Sri Lanka to revive the activities of the banned outfit by indulging in arms smuggling, ferrying of drugs and using hawala for transfer of funds. Earlier, NIA charged some active LTTE cadres including a Sri Lankan woman Letchumanan Mary Franciska and five others for forging documents to use a bank account so that, LTTE’s activities can be funded. While filing a charge sheet against them on 29 March this year, the NIA said – “Mary Franciska, T. Kenniston Fernando and K. Baskaran entered into a conspiracy with foreign entities to siphon off deposits in dormant bank accounts by using Indian identity documents obtained fraudulently and forging identity documents to revive, revamp and regroup LTTE in India and Sri Lanka. They were abetted by Johnson Samuvel, Dharmendran and Mohan in forging Indian identity documents.” In October last year, a former intelligence officer of LTTE – Satkunam alias Sabesan was arrested in a probe into seizure of five AK-47 rifles, thousands of rounds of 9 mm ammunition and 300 kg of heroin from fishing vessel Ravihansi, which was intercepted by the Coast Guard off the coast of Minicoy in Lakshadweep on 18 March 2021. “Sebastian played a crucial role in routing the proceeds of drugs trafficking to former LTTE cadres in Sri Lanka for the revival of LTTE,” the agency said in a statement in October 2021.

Sri Lanka is witnessing an unprecedented economic crisis and the situation is exacerbated by political and social turmoil, it said. Consequently, the supply of food in local markets is shrinking and food inflation is soaring, reaching 90 per cent in July 2022. Moreover, four in every ten households experienced a reduction in their incomes and one in every two households are currently relying on negative coping mechanisms to cope with the lack of food or money to buy it, said FAO. This also has to be looked at in the context that nearly 40 per cent of the population depends on agriculture as a primary source of income, it said. But the ongoing multidimensional crisis is posing an enormous threat to their livelihoods and disrupting the national food system, FAO warned. “Agricultural production is on a downward trend since mid-2021 due to the unavailability of fertilisers and other essential production inputs; livestock keepers are unable to access feed and basic veterinary supplies and fishers are unable to access fuel for motorised boats,” said FAO. Therefore, immediate action to provide farmers with quality seeds, fertilisers and pesticides will enable them to protect their livelihoods and feed their communities, it said. “It is also critical to provide the most vulnerable farmers, livestock keepers and fishers with cash assistance to enable them to restore their productive assets and fast-track their recovery,” it added.

General Secretary of the All Ceylon Nurses Union, S.B. Mediwatta yesterday (19) said that a large number of regional and rural hospitals, especially in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Monaragala, Galnewa and Vavuniya, will be severely affected by the proposed retirement plan by the end of December this year.  In some of those hospitals there were three to four nurses retiring when they have only about seven to ten nurses to serve in them. He said at least 400 nurses would be retiring by end of this year. The situation would worsen by the end of five years as over 8,000 nurses would complete the age of 60. Those who joined the service in 1988, 1989 and 1990 would belong to this group. Mediwatte said that although advertisements had been placed and about 3,500 applicants had been accepted the Health Ministry was yet to interview them as new nursing trainees. At least 2,000 trained nurses have left service after completing seven eight years due to delays in promotions which have led to delays in grade promotions which would afford them salary increments, allowances etc and the  economic issues. The ACNU General Secretary urged the government and provincial councils to make necessary arrangements to recruit nurses to ensure that the remaining nurses would not have to bear the weight of ensuring that hospital services run smoothly.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He told Ceylon Today that there were 23 children, four young girls and 29 women and the rest were men between the ages of 18 and 23. There was also an elderly person over the age of 70 who was treated at the KKS base hospital after becoming ill while travelling for more than a week. He also said, they are from Myanmar and it still needs to be verified to which community they belong. Their language is not understood and assistance was sought to clarify matters. According to the Navy Spokesman, they are all in good health and are currently being guarded by the Police at the Navy camp. They are being fed by the Navy. He said, Navy’s three patrol boats, one gun boat and two Dovra went on rescue operation and brought them ashore at KKS.

According to reports, the distressed vessel entered Sri Lanka’s territorial waters on late Saturday night after experiencing a technical problem while transporting these individuals from Myanmar to Indonesia. According the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Rohingya activists it is reported that another two boats with about 200 Rohingyas are now adrift in the Strait of Malacca. They reportedly began their journey from the coast of Bangladesh late last month and some of them reportedly died amid shortage of food and water for more than a week. The UNHCR last week repeated its earlier appeal to rescue the Rohingyas, who otherwise, risk death. “We are grateful to the Sri Lankan Navy and all who have acted to save lives,’’ said Indrika Ratwatte, UNHCR’s Director for Asia and the Pacific. “This is an example in humanity that all States in the region must follow to promptly and swiftly act to prevent the tragic loss of life at sea,” he added. The UNHCR is providing support to the Sri Lankan authorities for the immediate needs of those who were rescued. Also, the UNHCR yesterday (19) said it repeats its appeal to all responsible States to rescue those in distress and adrift on the boats, allowing them to safely disembark in line with legal obligations and humanitarian traditions. It remains concerned on reports of another boat in distress in the Bay of Bengal, near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some 161 refugees have been reported dead or missing at sea in 2022.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Taking into account the damage caused to crops due to drought, floods and wild elephants, especially in the Maha season of 2021-22, steps have been taken to award such compensation. Accordingly, arrangements have been made to provide compensation to 31,613 farmers for 42,934 acres. Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera further said that it has been decided to raise the insurance amount per acre for paddy, maize, potato, chilli, onion and soya bean to Rs 100,000.  The Government will contribute Rs 40,000, and farmers can contribute the remaining Rs 60,000 by paying Rs 6,400 per season. Amaraweera also said that since the damage caused by wild animals and the Fall Army worm (sena caterpillar) has aggravated, farmers will be able to get some relief in case of crop damage. Anuradhapura District has the highest level of compensation with Rs 81 million being set aside while Rs 69 million has been allocated for Manampitiya in Polonnaruwa and Rs 68 million for Moneragala. Meanwhile, Minister Amaraweera recently handed over crop damage compensation to ten farmers at the Buttala Agricultural Service Centre, symbolising compensation for farmers harmed by the Sena caterpillar."

Immigration officials have taken steps to deport them back on the same plane they arrived on. Among them is a 41-year-old Iranian national who works as a musician. The other Iranian, 50, is a professional photographer. The two had arrived at the BIA from Kuwait at 3.30 a.m. on Al Jazeera flight J-9551 on 17 December.  When they presented their Norwegian passports to obtain visa approval to enter Sri Lanka, immigration officials identified them as fake and referred them to the Katunayake Airport Border Enforcement Unit officers. These passports have been found to be fake. The two Iranians intended to spend two days in Sri Lanka before fleeing to Stockholm, Sweden. They had forged the United Arab Emirates immigration stamps in the Norwegian passports to accomplish this. They had paid a Turkish broker 20,000 euros to arrange these two fake Norwegian airline tickets. That sum is equal to Rs 7,780,000 in local currency. Further, they have declared to Immigration officials that all of their money was stolen by the broker. During preliminary investigations, Katunayake Airport immigration officials found that they had attempted to flee the country due to political unrest in Iran. After arresting them, while inspecting their belongings, immigration officers found their original Iranian passports hidden in their luggage.

If doctors, engineers, and other professionals in the State service retire at the age of sixty, the same law must apply to all politicians, according to Venerable Kappitiyagoda Sirivimala Thera, Anunayake of the Rajopavanaramadhipati Ramanna Nikaya of Gatambe. He was speaking at the  Gatambe Vihara when Prof. G.L. Peiris paid a visit yesterday (18). “The Prime Minister has issued a circular in this regard stating that at the age of sixty, all State employees should retire. This means that after the age of sixty, people experience physical, mental, and health problems, as well as other weaknesses, so the retirement age has been set at sixty years, as recommended by doctors. How can politicians work after sixty years?” he queried. Speaking further, he said the same law should apply to politicians as well. Otherwise it was a grave  injustice for retire only state employees to retire at sixty. “How can politicians work if state employees cannot? This is an amusing fact. We, the Maha Sangha, believe that politicians in this country should voluntarily retire at the age of 60 and make opportunities available to young people who can work. Otherwise, there is no reason to stay in Parliament until you walk with a walking stick. Many people define public service as serving themselves. Because of the privileges, many do not even consider retiring from Parliament,” he said. Speaking further, the Thera highlighted that this system should be changed and that youth groups should be given opportunities, adding that Parliament was the most powerful place in the country to take decisions and make laws.”How can people who can’t think and whose health has deteriorated work to build a country?” he queried. “If there are academics or other people over the age of sixty, they can get their services by forming a voluntary parliamentary advisory council. The masses are unable to bear the burden of life. Despite claims that there is no money to do anything in the country, the number of ministers continues to grow. They are attempting to spend and sell the country’s resources to accomplish this,” he said. The Thera also requested that all such things should stop, that political opinions be set aside and that everyone should come together and work to lift the country out of the abyss it has fallen into, even if only for a short time.
