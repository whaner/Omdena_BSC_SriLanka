Speaking to the media, Dr. de Silva emphasised that the SJB will not back the programme if it includes a debt haircut that effectively writes off debt, and stressed the importance of protecting depositors. He also reiterated the SJB’s stance that the Government should not touch the funds of the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF). The SJB will only support the programme if the Government agrees to their outlined conditions, he added. Additionally, Dr. de Silva revealed that the Opposition had been informed about the Government’s plan to present the domestic debt restructuring plan to Cabinet on 28 June, followed by referral to the Public Finance Committee on 29 June, and ultimately seeking approval from Parliament on the forthcoming Saturday.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/26/no-direct-evidence-covid-started-in-wuhan-lab/,No direct evidence Covid started in Wuhan lab,Author not found,0,2023-06-25T20:33:00+00:00,"US intelligence agencies found no direct evidence that the Covid-19 pandemic stemmed from an incident at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, a report declassified on Friday (23) said. The four-page report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said the US intelligence community still could not rule out the possibility that the virus came from a laboratory, however, and had not been able to discover the origins of the pandemic. “The Central Intelligence Agency and another agency remain unable to determine the precise origin of the Covid-19 pandemic, as both (natural and lab) hypotheses rely on significant assumptions or face challenges with conflicting reporting,” the ODNI report said. The report said while “extensive work” had been conducted on coronaviruses at the Wuhan institute (WIV), the agencies had not found evidence of a specific incident that could have caused the outbreak. “We continue to have no indication that the WIV’s pre-pandemic research holdings included SARS-CoV-2 or a close progenitor, nor any direct evidence that a specific research-related incident occurred involving WIV personnel before the pandemic that could have caused the Covid pandemic,” the report said. The origins of the coronavirus pandemic have been a matter of furious debate in the United States almost since the first human cases were reported in Wuhan in late 2019. US President Joe Biden in March signed a bill declassifying information related to the origins of the pandemic. Biden said at the time of signing that he shared Congress’ goal of releasing as much information as possible about the origin of Covid-19. The debate was refuelled by a Wall Street Journal report in February that the US Energy Department had assessed with “low confidence” in a classified intelligence report that the pandemic most likely arose from a Chinese laboratory leak, an assessment Beijing denies. FBI Director Christopher Wray said on 28 February his agency had assessed for some time that the origins of the pandemic were “most likely a potential lab incident” in the Chinese city of Wuhan. China said this claim had “no credibility whatsoever”. As of 20 March, four other US agencies still judged that Covid-19 was likely the result of natural transmission, while two were undecided.

Justice Rohini Marasinghe was part of the 11-member Commonwealth Election Observation Mission headed by the former Vice President of the Republic of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, and High Commissioner Veluppillai Kananathan, who is a well-known personality in Africa, was invited by the Electoral Commission of Sierra Leone to join the international observer mission.  It was a unique occurrence that two members from Sri Lanka were included in the international election observer mission in an African country. High Commissioner Kananathan has already been engaged as an election observer in the recent general elections in Kenya and Nigeria. While on the election observation mission, High Commissioner Kananathan met with high-profile African personalities, including former President of Nigeria Goodluck Jonathan, former President of Ethiopia Hailemariam Desalegn, former Prime Minister of Burkina Faso Kadré Désiré Ouédraogo, and former Vice President of Nigeria Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. Further, the High Commissioner also met with the lead Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates and other candidates. Further, the European Union (EU), the African Union Commission (AUC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and other teams led by non-governmental organisations comprised the electoral observation mission. During her visit to Sierra Leone, Justice Rohini Marasinghe, a retired Supreme Court Judge and the current Chair of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, intends meeting with Bishop Dr. Joseph Humper, Chairman of the TRC Sierra Leone, early next week. She had a conversation with Yasmin Jusu-Sheriff over the phone and meeting is fixed for Sunday. The human rights abuses had occurred in Sierra Leone between 1991 and 2002. Justice Marasinghe said that Sri Lanka studied the experiences of the TRC in South Africa and added that Sri Lanka was in the process of establishing a suitable model of a truth and reconciliation and the normative Act of the TRC is already in preparatory process. She said that the country is very much committed to deal with the past conflict in the North and East as well as the conflict in the South in the 70s and 80s and move forward as both parties had committed atrocities and now the time has come to put an end to that dark era. She said that most important matter is to understand the challenges faced by the TRC Sierra Leone and the manner it could overcome those challenges. Justice Marasisnsghe further explained that it is important before the country moves for transitional justice, there must be a well-established agreement with families of the victims and the perpetrators. The terms of reference of the Commission including its mandate and the composition must be acceptable to all concerned. Justice Marasinghe intends to have a full briefing on this matter with the local members of the TRC of Sierra Leone. The TRC of Sierra Leone comprised a diverse group of professionals, including lawyers, academics, religious leaders, and activists, who collectively worked towards achieving the objectives of truth, reconciliation, and healing in Sierra Leone."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/26/happy-birthday-thaththa/,Happy Birthday Thaththa!,Author not found,0,2023-06-25T20:30:00+00:00,"Today, 26 June, my father will turn 86. He’s not in the best of health and is in no condition to celebrate. My mother, brothers and perhaps some close relatives and friends will be there to wish him. I will be a few hours late. By the time I reach home from the airport, he is likely to be asleep. That kills me because my father would always be a few hours early for my birthday and those of my brothers. Eric Cooray, my father, was always surrounded by lots of people as a young man, but all that changed when he married my mother. From that day onwards he was absolutely devoted to her and later to us as well. I can’t remember my baby days, but I vividly remember my first days at S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia. I insisted that I sit close to a window. He was strictly instructed to locate himself so that I could see him. He didn’t need to be told. I was extremely attached to him and he loved all of us very much, as I realised much later, for it was a pattern — he never let us down. He put up with all our nonsensical demands and quite happily too. Nothing has impressed me more than the fact that he has always been a family man, first to his wife, then to his sons and now to his daughters-in-law and grandchildren. A few weeks ago, when he was in hospital, there were times I fell asleep out of exhaustion. I always woke up feeling guilty because I remembered how he stayed up by our beds when we fell sick, checking on us throughout the night. Then I understood and appreciated all over again the fact that he has always been my hero. He has set the standards that I aspire to achieve and maintain. My father, who hails from Paiyagala, was an extremely hard-working man who lived a very tough life but faced all challenges with utmost calm and exemplary courage, never once compromising his principles. A strong Catholic, he firmly believed that God gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason. He spoke little and didn’t care much for those who overdramatised matters. Neither did he speak ill will of anyone. He may have had reservations about people, but he kept those to himself. It was clear however that he appreciated loyalty and honesty. Indeed, he taught us the virtues of both qualities, simply by affirming them in his life. He worked hard and appreciated deeds more than words. He bore his crosses quietly, grieved in private. He knew who he was and what he was capable of. He never pretended to be someone he was not. He was proud of what he had accomplished but was not one to brag about it. His grit, discipline and faith saw him through the tough times, but he didn’t make a song and dance about it. Family, as I said, was everything to him. He wanted to see his sons grow into strong men and responsible citizens and did everything to make this possible but didn’t let any of it detract from his love and loyalty to his wife, our mother. Today, as I, now a father, struggle to do everything to make it possible for my daughters to grow into strong, intelligent, compassionate, and responsible young women, I find myself drawing extensively from my father’s life, thinking the ways of parenting. He has taught me even though he hardly ever lectured me about such things. I too want to be the bedrock of my family as he was the bedrock of his. I strive to cultivate his indomitable spirit and often wonder if I can ever emulate him. It doesn’t matter, though. Whenever I have to make an important or difficult decision, I simply ask myself ‘What would Thaththa have done?’ Invariably I remember many instances where he did things in a certain way and I get the answer I was looking for. I don’t know if I ever lived up to his expectations, but then again he never insisted that any of us should be anything other than what we wanted to be. He was distant that way. Correctly so, I might add. He’s close in so many other ways; so close and such a giant too that he makes me feel very small, and so well protected by him even though he’s in his eighties and I am in my fifties.

Speaking in Parliament, Jayasekara stressed that the cockpit crew had undertaken a deliberate slowdown of work, as a form of strike action, motivated by payment issues arising during the Covid-19 period. Jayasekara said, while some of their demands were reasonable, others were not and the delay would persist until their concerns were adequately addressed. Additionally, he alleged that the engineers were also engaged in a trade union action. In response, Minister of Ports, Shipping and Civil Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva assured that he would provide a comprehensive explanation on the matter later. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

Addressing the media at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), the Minister pointed out that some companies in the country had not passed on concessions to the consumers despite benefiting significantly from the Government. They have enjoyed extraordinary profitability. “It is crucial for them to consider the welfare of the people. If we aim to develop our nation, we must also reduce the prices of non-essential goods. Construction activities need to resume across the country, and every citizen should have the opportunity to build a house and have access to proper sanitation facilities. Therefore, we anticipate taking legal action against companies that unreasonably increase prices,” he stressed. Furthermore, the main focus of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) is on informing consumers rather than conducting raids, he said. Fernando said as proper price displays can go a long way in addressing pricing concerns, he has instructed the CAA to assess whether price displays are being carried out effectively. The Minister said after receiving concessions from the government, these industrialists have the capacity to reduce prices even further. “The CAA has been instructed to ensure that prices are not unjustifiably maintained in the future. Additionally, we are in the process of establishing maximum retail prices for tiles, cement, and bathroom accessories. It is our mandate to set a maximum retail price for every product sold within our country. The import reduction of tiles led to an increase in their prices. By strengthening the value of our currency against the dollar, we can introduce competition in this connection. I have urged them to prepare for this challenge,” he said. Through the measures implemented by our Government, we have created an environment conducive to providing relief to consumers, he said and added, “I have conveyed to these companies the necessity of explaining their price calculations when setting retail prices for cement in the future. The maximum retail price should be determined by considering production costs, profits, and the trader’s margin.” BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

This measure aims to reduce stress on children and promote stronger parent-child bonds by allowing children to spend more time with their parents. The District Secretary has also urged representatives of private educational institutions and resource persons to raise awareness among parents, as requested by social activists. To achieve this, the cooperation of all Divisional Secretaries, Divisional Secretariat Children’s Division Officers, religious institutions, charitable organisations, parents, and private educational institutions is essential in spreading awareness about this decision. The new regulations also require private educational institutions, involved in co-curricular activities (such as arts and sports) up to Grade 9, special group classes, and classes conducted through online platforms like Zoom to discontinue these activities from 1 July. Furthermore, the institutions must refrain from conducting classes on Sundays and evening classes on Fridays, the Secretariat noted. Private educational institutions are also expected to have adequate health facilities and suitable locations for the learning process of students. These aspects will be verified by the Department of Health, Local Government Councils, and Divisional Secretariats. All private educational institutions engaged in educational activities, including those conducting special group classes must submit company-specific reports to the local councils and provide details to the divisional secretariats. Additionally, apart from academic activities, institutions should allocate 15-30 minutes to sensitise students on spiritual and social issues. In order to streamline the operations of private educational institutions and facilitate their input and feedback in the future, it is proposed to establish a registered organisation, at the district level, that integrates all such institutions currently involved in educational activities. This organisation would serve as a platform for representatives to express their opinions and observations. To ensure the proper implementation of the aforementioned resolutions and facilitate future activities, committees will be formed at the district and regional levels. These committees will comprise representatives from the health department, Police, education department, religious leaders, social workers, child welfare officers, and private educational institutions. Monthly discussions will be organised through this group to raise awareness among parents and monitor the effective functioning of these activities, aiming to bring about social change.

It was revealed that a sum of Rs 56 billion (Rs 56,388 million) has been estimated for the 11 projects that have been halted midway due to the problems between the institutions, and although the UDA has spent Rs 2.5 billion (Rs 2,531 million), there are outstanding bills of Rs 1.4 billion (Rs 1,423 million) for further payment. Also, it was revealed that a sum of Rs 56.6 billion (Rs 56,999 million) is required for the completion of the projects. The Committee emphasised that in addition to the projects that have been stopped, due to lack of funds, the main reason for these projects to stop is that there is no good cooperation or agreement between the relevant institutions. The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development which met on Tuesday (20) under the Chairmanship of Ajith Mannapperuma, took into consideration the projects which have been initiated by the Urban Development Authority but have been abandoned due to various reasons thereby making a change in the strategies or existing rules followed in starting and maintaining the projects. Since, there are projects that have been stopped due to lack of funds, as well as projects that have been stopped due to institutional issues that need to be resolved, between various institutions, the committee focused its attention on projects that have been stopped midway due to problems between institutions. The Ceylon Electricity Board, Road Development Authority, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Sri Lanka Railway Department, he Urban Development Authority and the Prisons Department were called before the Committee,. Among the 11 projects that have been stopped, due to inter-institutional issues, are the construction of the new access road from Kottawa to Mahenawatta, the development of Alavwa town (road widening), the construction of the entrance to Yakkala from the Gampaha highway, the expansion of Imaduwa town, the construction of low-income houses in Beruwanawatta, Eheliyagoda and Hatton. The committee considered the development of the railway station and the relocation of the Welikada prison. Work on the construction of the new access road from Kottawa to Mahenawatta is about 98% completed and the problem of land acquisition has been largely resolved, as another place has been proposed for the people who will lose their land and prior to resolving the remaining issues with the Homagama Divisional Secretary, the project can be given to the Road Development Authority for completion Officials of the Urban Development Authority said. It was disclosed that the construction of 34 low-income houses in Beruwanawatta, Eheliyagoda, planned to resettle people who will lose their land during the construction of the proposed by-pass instead of the pass through the city, which is very important for the development of Eheliyagoda, has been stopped due to problems in obtaining electricity and water supply for those houses. The Committee instructed that since the houses have been completed, to have the projects completed by resolving problems of providing facilities with the Electricity Board and the Ratnapura District Community Water Supply Department and to resolve ownership issues of the land existing between the Railway Department and the Road Development Authority through cooperation between the institutions. Furthermore, it was revealed before the Committee that although the land acquisition work of the proposed Gampaha, Makavita Nelumwila Health Lane Project has been completed, the project has stopped midway. As Rs 13 million has been spent for this purpose, the Committee instructed to carry out urban forestry on this piece of land and use it in the process of increasing forest cover in Sri Lanka. Under the relocating of the Welikada prison, the Prisons Department and the Urban Development Authority were instructed that the value of the land where Welikada is currently located should be accurately assessed by the Government Valuation Department, and the money obtained by leasing the existing land or calling for tenders and selling the land should be used to locate the prison on the proposed land in Horana with more space and facilities under approved measurements. The Committee emphasised that the cost can be covered through the investment received without spending government funds for the relevant project. The Committee also emphasised that by replacing the Welikada prison, the government hopes to use the more valuable Welikada land for other productive investment purposes and to re-establish the prison with more spacious facilities with the large amount of funds received. According to the facts considered, the Committee emphasised that the main reason for the ceasing of the projects is the lack of good cooperation or agreement between the institutions involved."

The Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association of Doctors (MCPA) yesterday (21) accused the Minister and the Secretary of posing a threat to the lives of Sri Lankan citizens.   Dissatisfied civil activists and civil organisations accused the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of having a laid back attitude against the complaint that had been lodged against the Health Minister, Keheliya Rambukwella and former State Minister Prof. Channa Jayasumana. However, dissatisfied by the existing law enforcement mechanism, the group met the President’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake yesterday (21) on an invitation to discuss the issue. Jamuni Kamanta Roshan, of the National Movement Against Bribery and Corruption, lodged the complaint in collaboration with several civil rights organisations. The complaints noted that government had lost large sums of money through the purchase of cheap antibiotics and other medicinal drugs under emergency purchasing. The organisation pointed out that there were possibilities of producing surgical raw materials locally. But, these ventures had been thwarted to buy equipment and accessories from foreign countries causing damage. “The President’s Secretary and the President are aware of the sluggishness of the investigations conducted into corruption charges lodged against the Minister and the State Minister even when purchasing Covid vaccines,” the MCPA alleged. The Data Fraud which occurred at the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), the questionable purchases of the State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC) and the operation of the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) were also taken into consideration during discussions.

The construction had come to a halt following the suspension of Japan’s JAICA loan facility, which occurred shortly after the country was declared financially bankrupt. To avoid further delays, the construction of the second passenger terminal, at the airport, resumed on 20 May, utilising funds from the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd. The construction is being carried out by Sri Lanka’s ACESS Engineering Company, under the supervision of Japan Airport Consultants, Inc. (JAC). The event was attended by Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation, K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, Secretary to the Ministry, Retd. Major General (Rtd.) G. A. Chandrasiri,  Chairman of the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd., as well as officials from the consultancy and construction institutions. A sum of Rs 500 million has been utilised as expenditure by the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd., for these constructions. Expressing views at the occasion the Minister said, “Due to the recent economic situation in the country, international donor agencies had halted loans to Sri Lanka. However, I am pleased to announce that the government has made significant progress in engaging with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As a result of these fruitful discussions, Japan and JAICA have decided to release loan facilities to support the country’s development process.” The Minister said the construction of the airport’s second terminal has been given top priority with the aid of these facilitations. Additionally, he mentioned that as a result, the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd. has allocated Rs 500 million for these crucial constructions. “A special Cabinet approval has also been obtained for this,” he added."
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/22/country-heading-towards-severe-shortage-of-specialist-doctors/,Country heading towards severe shortage of specialist doctors,Author not found,0,2023-06-21T20:33:00+00:00," With 4,000 consultant specialists being required by 2025 and only around 2,050 specialist doctors in place by 2023, the country would face a more serious situation in the near future, due to  the retirement of a total 250 specialist doctors by 31 December 2023, in accordance with a Government Gazette, warned the health services. Countering a news report, published in the Ceylon Today on 13 June 2023, in which the Government Medical Officers’ Forum (GMOF) accused over 200 consultants of remaining in service beyond retirement age, informed medical sources yesterday (21) accused the Forum and certain parties with vested interests of blowing the issue out of context. “The situation has nothing to do with highly popular posting, it is about viewing the bigger picture and seeing the plight of the country, should M.B.B.S. qualified doctors opt to go abroad while the existing consultants, with experience, are sent on retirement. Special units will collapse without specialists, leading to closure of hospitals, especially in the peripheries of the island due to shortage of qualified medical professionals for them to function,” they explained. Further explaining, sources said that the retirement of about 250 specialist doctors, who had reached the age of 60 by30 June, 30 and 31 December 2023, would take place in accordance with this Gazette Notification. What the union failed to enumerate was the collapse of several services which would occur as a result. While the currently available number of consultants would further reduce with their forced retirement from service, the shortage created may result in the closure of several medical units in countrywide hospitals. Citing an example sources noted that currently there were 18 Cardio Thoracic consultants while the cadre requirement for the speciality was 27. Of them the National Hospital, Colombo has six Cardio Thoracic consultants,  Kandy four ,Teaching Hospital Karapitiya  three, Lady Ridgeway Hospital has three and Teaching Hospital Jaffna has two. While one consultant would be retiring on reaching the age of 63 the remaining five affiliated to the NHSL would be forced to retire if the gazetted regulations were implemented with regard to the medical profession as well. Sources said that this would jeopardise cardiac procedures such as stenting at the NHSL, Colombo while in order to rectify the situation a consultant would have to be transferred from one of the other stations to Colombo. They said that the situation was prevalent in the other specialties as well. While those being forced to retire earlier, the expected age of 60 would include paediatricians, physicians and anaesthetists. Of the 302 cadre projection for Paediatric consultants, Sri Lanka had only 146. Of them 28 were scheduled to retire on reaching the age of 60 by 31 December 2023. Five would retire on reaching the age of 63 by the end of this year while those lost to the State health service, other than by retirement, (by migrating or joining the private sector or universities) numbered 23. They said that 12 board certified paediatric consultants, had returned to Sri Lanka in 2022.  There were already 63 vacant paediatric posts in the 2023 annual transfer list. While in 2020, 2021 and 2022 only about 400 to 500 medical practitioners left the country or joined the private sector, this year the number had topped 700. Sources noted that the 2023 annual transfer list had been “strategically delayed by the State health authorities for about six months and had been released on the Health Ministry’s website recently.” Currently, there was a shortage of about 750 specialists in the country according to the 2023 transfer list. About 350 have left the country by December last year, while the numbers that had completed training abroad and returned to the island according to the data of the Post Graduate Institute Medicine (PGIM) was about 250 while, of them about 120 have returned to the island after completing their staffing requirements only to leave the island once more, they explained. However it should be considered unfortunate if health authorities and the government imagine that the 150 will be adequate to fill in the 750 vacancies. In addition, while forcing retirement on those who complete 60 years by the end of 2023, about 50 specialist doctors over the age of 63 have been verbally asked to continue working on a temporary contract basis, they charged. While State health officials and the government could point out with evidence that the vacancy of specialist doctors in the island may exceed 1,000 by next year they would not be able to increase the number to even the existing 2,500 with the loss of consultant doctors who were to be forced into retirement at the end of this year. Of the required 4,000 by 2025 the country would have only about 1,750 in service by 01 January 2024, they lamented. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara yesterday (21) said in Parliament that this decision comes as a response to the significant challenges faced by Sri Lankan migrant workers, caused by continuous delays of SriLankan Airlines flights. The Minister made these revelations in response to concerns raised by MP Dayasiri Jayasekara, who highlighted the difficulties faced by migrant workers due to flight delays. Nanayakkara further said that in the interim, temporary arrangements have been made to send Sri Lankan migrant workers to South Korea via Singapore after a two-week waiting period. “As an immediate measure, we have devised a plan to have our workers travel on SriLankan Airlines flights to Singapore and then proceed to South Korea on Korean flights. This temporary arrangement will be implemented in two weeks,” he announced. Nanayakkara emphasised the gravity of the situation, explaining that the flight delays have resulted in severe hardships for migrant workers, as their employers in South Korea have been unwilling to accept them when they arrive late. Furthermore, the Minister expressed disappointment in SriLankan Airlines for disregarding the repeated complaints regarding flight delays and the resulting issues faced by the workers. This month, a group of workers to Korea could not be sent due to the delay of flight UL 470 for about 12 hours. In May, in a similar turn of events, SriLankan Airlines flight was delayed and the Human Resources Department of Korea refused to accept the Sri Lankan workers who were to leave for Korea on that flight. However, with the intervention of the Foreign Employment Bureau, the workers left the country for Korea on 4 June, but the flight was delayed for two hours on that day as well.

In a statement, the airline said, “Unfortunately, one cockpit crew member, who was scheduled for this flight, was sick last night, and due to the various regulations for fatigue and safety, that govern operating crew, there was no available replacement until the morning of 21 June 2023.” SriLankan Airlines said it regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers by the delay of UL 470. In such circumstances, the airline does everything possible to keep the passengers updated and provide hotel accommodation for those who need it. “The airline is also working with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment and Korean authorities to rebook the passengers scheduled to travel to Seoul for work on the next earliest flight. As a matter of fact, SriLankan’s flight schedule to South Korea is primarily based on supporting the travel needs of migrant workers and in that regard SriLankan has been collaborating closely with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) since April 2022. “All airlines have delays from time to time. This is an industry which is highly regulated for safety reasons, with strict rules governing flying hours, maintenance checks and under what conditions an aircraft may or may not fly. SriLankan Airlines monitors its on-time performance very closely. In the first quarter of 2023, SriLankan Airlines’ performance was fully in line with the major alliances, and the airline’s record for long delays over the first five months of the year compares favourably with the average for airlines flying from Colombo,” the airline said."

According to the facts considered, the Committee emphasised that the main reason for the ceasing of the projects is the lack of good cooperation or agreement between the institutions involved."

He emphasised that merely giving houses may lead to problems such as selling the houses or being unable to maintain them. Therefore, the best approach would be to empower plantation workers to construct their own homes by allowing them to demolish the existing line rooms. He said there are presently 14,000 people living in temporary shelters, not even in line rooms but essentially homeless. “Considering the need for approximately 205,000 houses, it is crucial to be realistic,” he said. Minister Thondaman emphasised he would not want to mislead the people by falsely claiming to provide houses when the land is not rightfully theirs. “In light of these circumstances, the practical solution would be to grant land rights to the workers and assist them in demolishing the line rooms. An allocated area, such as 10 perches, could be demarcated for each worker to build their own house. Sufficient time should be provided for them to complete the construction. If they encounter difficulties, they can apply for loans through the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA), with the option to deduct repayment instalments from their salaries.” The Minister highlighted that his intention is not to promote political gains through housing distribution. Rather, he believes that if the workers build their own homes, they will take responsibility for their maintenance. “It is essential to provide them with the opportunity to build their own houses as it fosters social progress, which, in turn, leads to economic progress,” he added. Moreover, Minister Thondaman questioned the rationale behind building 10,000 houses using Indian grants. He pointed out that although these houses may cater to some of the population, the overall demand for housing will continue to rise. Instead of relying on external aid, the focus should be on granting land rights to the workers, allowing them to build their own houses. President Ranil Wickremesinghe plans to form a committee, comprising members from various political parties to collectively address this issue, he added. Rather than focusing on highlighting poverty for attention, the aim is to present a viable solution. It is important to recognise that the entire community is not living below the poverty line. He said during a visit, the US Ambassador was shown both the line rooms and a vocational training centre. The Ambassador interacted with children who conversed with her in English. “This shows the progress made despite the challenges faced, including the 30 years of war, the JVP insurgency, and other crises. The focus is not merely on achieving equality, but also on promoting equity,” he added. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Furthermore, the Minister emphasised that this initiative would empower the bureau to thwart unnecessary interference and combat illegal activities effectively. He further revealed that, under the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Ministry of Finance has constituted a committee to oversee the implementation of this programme. Minister Nanayakkara conveyed these sentiments during a press conference held yesterday (20) at the President’s Media Centre. “Rebuilding the country was a daunting task, especially considering the dire state of our economy. We faced a severe shortage of foreign currency reserves, but we took on the responsibility of bringing in much-needed dollars. Through the efforts of our overseas workforce, comprising 312,000 dedicated individuals, we were able to contribute USD 4.8 billion to our nation’s economy. Their contribution played a significant role in improving our financial situation. We have made substantial progress in reducing inflation, which stood at a staggering 80 per cent when the President assumed office. Today, we have managed to bring it down to 25 per cent. I express my gratitude to the foreign workers who have played a crucial role in creating a liveable environment for our people,” he said. “However, we face various obstacles when it comes to investments, particularly due to rigid labour laws. Therefore, we must create a favourable environment for foreign investors by reforming labour laws to ensure worker protection. We also need to enhance the productivity of our labour force by providing investors with opportunities to collaborate and enhance productivity together,” he pointed out. The Minister said the country requires a comprehensive social security system. We have already begun drafting a Bill for the social security programme, which will be presented to the Cabinet after obtaining initial approval from the Labour Consultative Council appointed by the President. “Similarly, we are actively pursuing the digitisation of the labour department. Currently, the tender process is underway for the digitisation of the Employee Trust Fund (ETF), Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and the e-salary service. Furthermore, we are taking measures to introduce a licensing system that covers all professions, from labourers to doctors. It is crucial for anyone working in the country to be registered under this system, enabling us to have comprehensive information about their employment. Additionally, a programme is being implemented to extend social security benefits, including ETF and EPF, to daily wage workers,” he said. “To optimise government revenue, we have allocated vacant floors of the Mehewara Piyasa building to investors. Moreover, allowing foreign workers to import electric vehicles has resulted in saving USD 70 million for the country. This opportunity to import electric vehicles is available to anyone worldwide until September. We have already launched various welfare initiatives for foreign workers and are implementing nationwide programmes to provide vocational training for young people and creating job opportunities abroad. The first phase of this programme will commence with the global fair in Jaffna next month,” he added. Speaking further, Nanayakkara said as only 40 per cent of the workforce in Sri Lanka is engaged in direct employment, while the remaining 60% is in indirect employment, the government is committed to providing comprehensive benefits through a centralised fund. “This includes maternity benefits, compensation in case of job loss, and accident insurance. We secure these benefits through the funds acquired from ETF and contributions from employers. These measures are implemented without any bias towards political affiliations, as our goal is to safeguard the well-being of the people of our country,” he said. Nanayakkara also spoke about the Broadcasting Authority Bill. He said, “It is important to clarify certain misconceptions. This Act does not aim to suppress the media, as the government has no intention of controlling it. The Broadcasting Authority Act has several key objectives, with the primary one being the protection of freedom of speech as enshrined in the Constitution. “Freedom of speech is an essential right that cannot be compromised. However, it is crucial for accurate information to be disseminated, and self-censorship and responsible reporting are vital in achieving this goal. “The rules and regulations of the Broadcasting Authority Act are developed in collaboration with the Association of Broadcasters, without any government interference. ‘Journalists and media organisations are not restricted and licences are issued in a fair and unbiased manner. Nevertheless, it is necessary to have an independent committee to investigate and address any misinformation or damage caused by certain media outlets in the past, ensuring that such incidents are not repeated.”"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Jagoda further alleged that when considering certain ministries or government entities, nearly 50% of the employees serving in those entities would not meet the required standards, leading to low productivity levels. The digitalisation programme for State entities, as recommended by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, is a highly effective and prudent measure aimed at advancing the country’s economy and providing satisfactory services to the general public while minimising time and cost wastage. Jagoda cited the example of obtaining a passport within three days through the respective Divisional Secretariats as one of the focal points of the programmes introduced by the government. “We are aware that President Wickremesinghe has been entrusted with the significant responsibility of addressing the economic crisis and ensuring a satisfactory livelihood for those affected. Digitalisation is one of the key factors that will drive economic progress,” Jagoda said. Jagoda also criticised the opposition for opposing the formulation of internationally accepted rules and regulations without taking responsibility. He mentioned that President Wickremesinghe, who eliminated criminal activities, is preparing the Broadcasting Authority Bill, which the Opposition alleges is an attempt to suppress media and its freedom of expression. Jagoda clarified that media owners and personnel have been given ample opportunities to express their views and proposals, and the proposed Act will not harm their rights; rather, it is aimed at protecting media rights.

It said: “Throughout this long journey the Board had brought significant fortunes to the people while contributing massively to the economic development of the country as well. It is quite unfortunate for our country to get caught in a massive economic crisis for the past two years which virtually paralysed the whole country and its people. Now we are marching towards dawn in the path of economic development and it is high time for us to remember and the tremendous support given to us by our District Sales Agents who have worked hard for us, despite their various hardships. We are obliged to remember their support at this moment and we look forward to strengthening their contribution towards the economic development of the country. It is the exact reason for our intention to talk to them today. Today is a very special day. “The National Lotteries Board was formed to strengthen the economic development of the people and the country and we have been executing our part firmly and satisfactorily towards the economic development, through six (06) lottery tickets. Accordingly, a development fund for the country’s health sector was established through the ‘Jathika Sampatha’ lottery introduced in 2010. Similarly, the ‘Shrama Vasana’ Fund was created for the ‘Shrama Dhana’ initiative. Lottery draws were held on Wednesdays and Saturdays and through this the National Lotteries Board was able to contribute massively to the economic development of the country. Now the draws are being held on all seven days of the week with the aim of supporting the integrated development of the country in a still better way. During its career, the Board had succeeded in creating hundreds of millionaires and other rich people. This year alone three millionaires got this fortune and plans are being made to increase this position. The number ‘7’ immediately comes to mind for anyone who utters the words lottery luck. The number ‘7’ cannot be easily forgotten by the multimillionaires and other rich people who got benefited by the lottery rewards. So, based on that principle, we have created a new lottery ticket named ‘Lucky 7’ by simulating the number ‘7’ and introducing it to the market today. Special Features of ‘Lucky 7’ Gift Pack: 1. Prize for initial digit too 2. Prize for final digit too 3. Prize if matched from start to finish 4. Prize if matched from end to start 5. Prize no matter how the numbers match 6. Zodiac gift 7. ‘Lucky 7’ Number Matching Prize (L 7) The special draw will be held on 14th July 2023. On that day a draw for the ‘7 Star’ number will be held with the offering of special gifts as follows: = Gift of a luxury car = Gift of gold coins = Rs 200,000 cash prizes. = Rs 100,000 cash prize for digit matches and millions worth other prizes. Since then onwards we look forward to bringing you even more gifts with ‘Lucky 7’ on all seven days of the week.”"

K. Jayawardena said, if flour based products, including bread, are to be reduced in price by Rs 10, as requested by the Minister of Trade, then, first and foremost, all wheat flour firms should reduce their prices. However, Minister of Trade Nalin Fernando said that before wheat flour firms conduct a price revision, they should seek the necessary approval from the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) as a Gazette Notification has already been issued preventing arbitrary increase in prices. Jayawardena added that when wheat flour firms and the ACBOA had consented to reduce the price of bread and flour based products, the consumers had not been able to enjoy that relief due to the haphazard issuance of Gazette Notifications by the subject Minister.

Addressing a letter to the Speaker, on behalf of the Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus and the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Children, Women and Gender, the chairperson of the Caucus, Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle, has stated that the Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus is very happy to see the inclusion of the concept of sexual bribery being addressed in the draft of the present Anti-Corruption Bill. However, the caucus said there should be a change in the offense of ‘sexual favour’. The Caucus requests that the term ‘sexual favour’ diminishes the offence and therefore, instead, the term ‘sexual bribery’ be substituted as it ensures that the gravity of the offence is reflected in the law. Dr. Fernandopulle pointed out that the second is that due to the Section 162 sub-section (f) re corruption – the draft Bill reflects that the offence is committed by both the giver and the taker of any bribe and the person giving the bribe may be treated unfairly. Thus, the Caucus requested the speaker to include an exception in the case of sexual bribery only, where the giver of the bribe is not considered the guilty party. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

Due to the significant impact this optimisation has on the market situation, Semasinghe emphasised the need to refrain from making statements that create doubts. He called for responsible actions from everyone involved. He mentioned that after President Wickremesinghe’s visit to France, a better understanding of issues, particularly regarding the restructuring of foreign debt, is expected. Semasinghe noted that criticisms have been raised on the current economic program implemented by the government, but he urged those criticising to present practical ideas or programs for the country’s development. The government aims to address the economic crisis without relying on the intervention of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). While specific solutions not involving the IMF were not mentioned, the government’s commitment and efforts are expected to lead to positive developments in 2024. Semasinghe highlighted the progress made in transparency, anti-corruption measures, and fraud prevention, which has gained international attention. The upcoming parliamentary week is expected to enhance confidence in Sri Lanka’s economy, administrative structure, and financial system. Passing important bills such as the Budget Office Bill and an Anti-Corruption Bill is crucial to strengthen the country’s financial market and attract investments, potentially changing rating agencies’ opinions about Sri Lanka. The first review with the IMF in September will showcase the progress made and the current programme being implemented. Alternative measures have already been taken to address the slight decrease in income levels. Semasinghe assured that the economic process is being successfully implemented in the country, although it may take some time for its effects to be felt by the people. Semasinghe emphasised the government’s commitment to advancing this program and cautioned against opposition or attempts to destabilise the political and social stability achieved. He called for support to steer the country onto a new path and prevent future crises. He acknowledged the existence of two groups in the country one that capitalises on people’s suffering during the economic crisis for political gain and another that genuinely supports the government’s efforts.

The NIA said the charge sheet was filed on Thursday against the arrested accused for the illegal drug trade to fund, amass and stash weapons for the revival of the LTTE in India and Sri Lanka. Three Indians named in the charge sheet are Selvakumar M, Vigneshwara Perumal alias Vicky and Iyyapan Nandhu. Further, the NIA has named Sri Lankan nationals C Gunashekharaan alias Guna and Pushparajah alias Pookutti Kanna, who allegedly ran a drug syndicate in the island nation and have been accused of working with Pakistani drugs and arms supplier Haji Salim. “The drugs were being sourced from Salim, who is suspected to be residing in Pakistan. The accused persons were using foreign WhatsApp numbers to carry out the clandestine trade,” the NIA said in a statement. Salim, as reported by HT on 30 April, allegedly worked with Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). He handled almost the entire maritime smuggling of drugs and arms to India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and other nearby countries, the agency said. “Investigations in the case had exposed their conspiracy to fund the revival of LTTE through the drug trade. They were arrested (last year) at the Trichy Special Camp. Investigations had further revealed that the accused were using the proceeds of crime to live a lavish life. Several mobile phones with pre-activated Indian SIM cards were also seized from them, along with various digital devices, documents relating to drug transactions, cash to the tune of eight million rupees and nine gold bars. The cash and gold were proceeds from the sale of narcotics and were being channelled through hawala networks between Chennai and Sri Lanka. Several transactions using Crypto platforms were also unearthed,” the NIA statement added. Besides Guna and Kanna, eight other Sri Lankans who have been named in the charge sheet are: Mohammad Asmin, Alahapperumage Sunil Ghamini Fonseka, Stanly Kennady Fernando, Dhanukka Roshan, Ladiya, Vella Suranga, Thilipan and Danarathnam Nilukshan. While Vicky and Nandhu were arrested in April this year, the others were arrested in December 2022. The federal agency is probing at least four cases related to conspiracy to revive the activities of LTTE in India and Sri Lanka. In October 2021, Satkunam alias Sabesan, a former intelligence officer of LTTE, was arrested by the NIA in connection with a probe into the seizure of five AK47 rifles, thousands of rounds of 9mm ammunition and 300 kg of heroin from fishing vessel Ravihansi, which was intercepted by the Coast Guard off the coast of Minicoy in Lakshwadeep on 18 March 2021.  (Hindustan Times)"

This year, the Kataragama Ruhunu Perahara will take place from today (19) to 4 July, attracting over 1.5 million devotees from across the country. However, this massive influx of people often leads to inadequate garbage management. In a statement, the CEA said, during this period, approximately 1,700 tons of solid waste is usually collected from various areas, including the Kataragama town, the pooja area, and the Manik River. To address this issue, the CEA in collaboration with the Kataragama District Secretariat and the Kataragama Perahara Committee, has organised several initiatives this year. “These efforts include baggage checks at the main entrance to the shrine, the provision of eco-friendly substitute bags as an alternative to polythene bags, the placement of Kataragama Pooja notification stickers on buses transporting pilgrims, the use of billboards and distribution of leaflets, and the installation of special bins for the proper disposal of plastic bottles, among other site setups. Additionally, proper garbage disposal arrangements have been made along the pathway of the Pada Yatra. After the Esala Perahara concludes, cleanup programmes will be conducted to ensure the Kataragama city, the pooja area and the Manik River are cleaned. These efforts aim to assist devotees in disposing of their garbage correctly and to maintain a clean environment throughout the festival,” the statement said. (SM)"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/19/mcpa-demands-presidents-attention-on-nmra-issues/,MCPA demands President’s attention on NMRA issues,Author not found,0,2023-06-18T20:32:00+00:00," Following the tragic death of another woman, who was given an anaesthetic drug, at Teaching Hospital Peradeniya, during a hernia surgery, the Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association of Doctors (MCPA) demanded that the President address the issues surrounding the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and restructure it with a scientific approach to ensure the well-being of the public. A 59-year-old school principal died on 16 June due to complications, possibly due to the anaesthetic drug, which caused the death of a pregnant woman earlier.  She was at the ICU for about two months. In the wake of this second death, MCPA President, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa, lashing out, said yesterday (18) the NMRA should work towards public benefit rather than that of the politicians, its officials, pharmacists or the trade unions, so that it was devoid of corruption. It is only then that even local and foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers could have access to its services sans bribery and corruption. Dr. Sanjeewa said he had repeatedly emphasised on the necessity to regulate the regulators in the NMRA, unfortunately as a result of negligence on the part of the health authorities and the government, human lives have been lost due to substandard drugs. Outlining issues, he noted that previously cosmetic drugs were under the direct supervision of the Cosmetic Devices and Drug Regulatory Authority (CDDRA). But with the NMRA being stripped of the power to regulate cosmetic drugs, beauticians and salons use various cosmetic products such as whitening creams. Confusion has been created following reports of a death allegedly due to an anaesthetic drug allergy and beauticians giving different types of skin whitening creams and injections and the continuous arrival of substandard and unregistered drugs into the country. The MCPA urged the President to intervene in unravelling the quandary in the NMRA and said it hoped to discuss the situation with him. Dr. Sanjeewa lamented that the NMRA, which had been tasked with the responsibility for providing superior drugs to the people of the country, had gone astray. He accused the government of having shirked its responsibility in ensuring the quality of the drugs made for citizens of the country. Not only did the NMRA not have a Laboratory facility certified by the Sri Lanka Standard Institute neither did it have a Technical Advisory Council that could provide proper scientific and technical advice until recently. The NMRA Act should be prepared in a very solid and scientific manner by a committee made up of subject experts in Sri Lanka to suit the country’s need rather than drafting it by assembling parts obtained from other countries, he noted. If the functioning of the NMRA was done appropriately, it would not be difficult to get an international standard for local pharmaceutical products. But under the current confusing situation, there was a backlog of more than 2,500 files related to pharmaceutical companies and products which have accumulated at the NMRA. Many misconceptions regarding the NMRA have been established in the society due to the actions of certain pharmacists and officials who consider the institution their private property, he accused. It is questionable as to why pharmacists, who have training only as general pharmacists, were serving in the NMRA, when there should be nationally and internationally trained pharmacists serving in it, in accordance with recommendations of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), he added.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/19/nhsls-microbiology-unit-not-functioning/,NHSL’s Microbiology Unit Not Functioning,Author not found,0,2023-06-18T20:32:00+00:00," Owing to the non-functionality of the Microbiology Unit of Colombo National Hospital, at least 10,000 tests including urine tests, sputum microbiology tests, antibiotic drug sensitivity tests, antibiotic resistance tests, that cost nearly Rs 30 million have been diverted to the private laboratories each month, the Academy of Health Professionals (AHP) lamented. The AHP alleged that Consultant Microbiologist of the Microbiology Unit of the Colombo National Hospital, who was tasked with instructing people about the danger of antibiotic resistance, was paving the way for such a dilemma by keeping the Unitnon-functional for the past two months. AHP President, Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (18) said that patients seeking free healthcare had to do about 200 urine culture tests per day in the private sector. Close to 10,000 tests including urine tests, sputum microbiology tests, antibiotic drug sensitivity tests and antibiotic resistance tests were diverted to the private laboratories per month. The Microbiology Unit of the NHSL, Colombo was incurring heavy losses to the Government as patients seeking treatment were being diverted to the private sector laboratory facilities. He noted that patients seeking treatment from government hospitals had to spend a tidy sum while the private labs received close to Rs 30 million worth tests from the NHSL non-functional bora Microbiology lab facility. He alleged that there was a serious suspicion as to whether there was a 20 to 30 per cent commission involved in this process. A minimum of Rs 3,000 had to be spent to get these tests done in a laboratory near the NHSL, Colombo. He noted that as a result many of the patients did not subject themselves to the test due to monetary reasons. It only worsened their condition and they had to be admitted to the hospital. To control the resulting complications, the Health Ministry had to spend a grand sum of money unnecessarily by having to administer antibiotics instead of oral antibiotics, Kumudesh lamented. Due to the inability to carry out antibiotic sensitivity tests, doctors were forced to presume what the disease was and recommend antibiotics increasing the risk of antibiotic resistance in the country.

Minister of Environment, Naseer Ahamed, presided over the discussion. The primary objective of the discussion was to formulate a plan addressing various environmental concerns in Colombo. These include flood control, continental air pollution control, global temperature control, air quality in the city both during the day and night, water quality in the Kelani River, coastal ecological system, mangrove and aquatic life protection, forest population and measures to preserve vegetation. The management of plastic, polythene, and non-degradable waste in Colombo is also an important issue to be addressed in this plan, aiming to improve the overall environmental conditions for pedestrians. The plan also emphasises the management of the Beira Lake, canals, and drainage systems to enhance health, hygiene, and the preservation of the city’s beauty and natural heritage. Gunawardena highlighted that, until now, there has been no environmental and climate plan specifically tailored for Colombo, and implementing such a plan would enable the city to become the ‘Garden City of Asia’. The Colombo Provincial Development Committee also pointed out the increasing population density in Colombo, attributed to various employment, service, business, educational, and tourism opportunities in the city. The objective of this project is to create a society with mental satisfaction through clean air, water, and environmental conditions, which are fundamental for the well-being of all residents. This plan aligns with the Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goals 3, 6, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 17. During the discussion, specific dates were set for the preparation of this plan, which will serve as a blueprint for the development of Colombo. By Sanjana Marzook"

The Minister emphasised the importance of transitioning public transportation to electric vehicles as a solution to these challenges. In addition to buses, efforts are underway to introduce electric three-wheelers, vans, and trains. He further mentioned that the private sector is expected to introduce electric three-wheelers within the current year. Furthermore, Gunawardena highlighted that the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) is taking steps to close down several unprofitable depots across the country. These steps are being taken to improve the financial sustainability of the SLTB, he added. BY Mithun Jayawardena"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/19/mcpa-demands-presidents-attention-on-nmra-issues/,MCPA demands President’s attention on NMRA issues,Author not found,0,2023-06-18T20:32:00+00:00," Following the tragic death of another woman, who was given an anaesthetic drug, at Teaching Hospital Peradeniya, during a hernia surgery, the Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association of Doctors (MCPA) demanded that the President address the issues surrounding the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and restructure it with a scientific approach to ensure the well-being of the public. A 59-year-old school principal died on 16 June due to complications, possibly due to the anaesthetic drug, which caused the death of a pregnant woman earlier.  She was at the ICU for about two months. In the wake of this second death, MCPA President, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa, lashing out, said yesterday (18) the NMRA should work towards public benefit rather than that of the politicians, its officials, pharmacists or the trade unions, so that it was devoid of corruption. It is only then that even local and foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers could have access to its services sans bribery and corruption. Dr. Sanjeewa said he had repeatedly emphasised on the necessity to regulate the regulators in the NMRA, unfortunately as a result of negligence on the part of the health authorities and the government, human lives have been lost due to substandard drugs. Outlining issues, he noted that previously cosmetic drugs were under the direct supervision of the Cosmetic Devices and Drug Regulatory Authority (CDDRA). But with the NMRA being stripped of the power to regulate cosmetic drugs, beauticians and salons use various cosmetic products such as whitening creams. Confusion has been created following reports of a death allegedly due to an anaesthetic drug allergy and beauticians giving different types of skin whitening creams and injections and the continuous arrival of substandard and unregistered drugs into the country. The MCPA urged the President to intervene in unravelling the quandary in the NMRA and said it hoped to discuss the situation with him. Dr. Sanjeewa lamented that the NMRA, which had been tasked with the responsibility for providing superior drugs to the people of the country, had gone astray. He accused the government of having shirked its responsibility in ensuring the quality of the drugs made for citizens of the country. Not only did the NMRA not have a Laboratory facility certified by the Sri Lanka Standard Institute neither did it have a Technical Advisory Council that could provide proper scientific and technical advice until recently. The NMRA Act should be prepared in a very solid and scientific manner by a committee made up of subject experts in Sri Lanka to suit the country’s need rather than drafting it by assembling parts obtained from other countries, he noted. If the functioning of the NMRA was done appropriately, it would not be difficult to get an international standard for local pharmaceutical products. But under the current confusing situation, there was a backlog of more than 2,500 files related to pharmaceutical companies and products which have accumulated at the NMRA. Many misconceptions regarding the NMRA have been established in the society due to the actions of certain pharmacists and officials who consider the institution their private property, he accused. It is questionable as to why pharmacists, who have training only as general pharmacists, were serving in the NMRA, when there should be nationally and internationally trained pharmacists serving in it, in accordance with recommendations of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), he added.

The AHP alleged that Consultant Microbiologist of the Microbiology Unit of the Colombo National Hospital, who was tasked with instructing people about the danger of antibiotic resistance, was paving the way for such a dilemma by keeping the Unitnon-functional for the past two months. AHP President, Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (18) said that patients seeking free healthcare had to do about 200 urine culture tests per day in the private sector. Close to 10,000 tests including urine tests, sputum microbiology tests, antibiotic drug sensitivity tests and antibiotic resistance tests were diverted to the private laboratories per month. The Microbiology Unit of the NHSL, Colombo was incurring heavy losses to the Government as patients seeking treatment were being diverted to the private sector laboratory facilities. He noted that patients seeking treatment from government hospitals had to spend a tidy sum while the private labs received close to Rs 30 million worth tests from the NHSL non-functional bora Microbiology lab facility. He alleged that there was a serious suspicion as to whether there was a 20 to 30 per cent commission involved in this process. A minimum of Rs 3,000 had to be spent to get these tests done in a laboratory near the NHSL, Colombo. He noted that as a result many of the patients did not subject themselves to the test due to monetary reasons. It only worsened their condition and they had to be admitted to the hospital. To control the resulting complications, the Health Ministry had to spend a grand sum of money unnecessarily by having to administer antibiotics instead of oral antibiotics, Kumudesh lamented. Due to the inability to carry out antibiotic sensitivity tests, doctors were forced to presume what the disease was and recommend antibiotics increasing the risk of antibiotic resistance in the country. Even the World Health Organization (WHO) had warned against this, the AHP President explained.  A few months earlier the same Microbiologist issued instructions to dispose off live microbiological films without proper biocidal conditions, resulting in health staff suffering from an extremely rare condition called ‘miliodosis’ while working in this laboratory.

Vithanage explained that while coconuts are sold at high prices ranging from Rs 120 to 130 each, the price of coconut oil remains fair due to the efficient supply chain. However, there is a group of individuals who sell coconut oil at an inflated price by falsely claiming that it is traditionally made. These unscrupulous entrepreneurs not only manipulate the coconut oil market but also cause the prices of eggs and chicken meat to rise. “These individuals aim to increase the price of coconut oil by disrupting its supply and creating a false shortage,” Vithanage emphasised. He also noted that this group had artificially inflated coconut oil prices the previous year too. These fraudulent businessmen produce coconut oil without proper raw materials or adhering to standard methods. To maximise profits, they even substitute or mix palm oil with coconut oil, which can be harmful to the consumers’ health. Vithanage said his union has already informed the relevant authorities, about these fraudulent practices, to safeguard consumers. He expressed concern that if these deceitful practices are successful, consumers in the country will not only have to pay high prices for coconut oil but also risk consuming coconut oil processed with toxic palm oil.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/19/nz-denies-asylum-to-convicted-lankan-counterfeiter-sex-offender/,"NZ denies asylum to convicted Lankan counterfeiter, sex offender",Author not found,0,2023-06-18T20:31:00+00:00,"A Sri Lanka asylum seeker in New Zealand (NZ), who claims his wealthy family’s connections got him off the hook with Sri Lankan authorities, had to face the full force of New Zealand law when he was convicted of sexual assault and counterfeiting currency. Now, the 33-year-old is being booted out of New Zealand on account of his offences despite arguing to remain, claiming he had become a Christian while in prison and his life would be in danger if he returned to his homeland. The man’s plight was recently set out in an Immigration and Protection Tribunal New Zealand decision, in which his name was redacted and he was instead referred to as HX. HX, a citizen of Sri Lanka, appealed to the tribunal against a decision declining to grant him refugee or protected person status. He gave details of his background, which included that his wider family was relatively wealthy due to political and business connections, and they owned several businesses themselves. From 2009 to 2011, HX undertook studies in a European country before returning to Sri Lanka to care for his sick father. His father died a short time later and despite HX’s uncles encouraging him to return overseas to complete his education, he stayed in Sri Lanka and began drinking, partying and engaging in antisocial behaviour. He told the tribunal his family’s connections sometimes got him out of trouble with the authorities. This appeared to be the case in 2013 when HX was arrested and charged with attempted murder after he struck a man in the head with a piece of timber, knocking him out, during a fight. “[HX] spent approximately 28 days in jail, after which he was released because his family paid money to the local authorities. The charge was later reduced.” However, he told the tribunal there were still two cases of civil proceedings against him in the Sri Lankan higher courts, brought by the man who he struck with the timber. The man alleges he has suffered long-term disabilities and is seeking damages. After HX was released from prison, ‘gang members’  connected to the earlier fight were allegedly making threats against him. He and his family went into hiding. He later decided to leave Sri Lanka for his own safety and he relocated to New Zealand to study. HX was granted a student visa in 2014 and then further student visas in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, he was approved for an essential skills work visa to work in healthcare. But in 2018, he began partying again and became involved in drug use. During this time, he sexually assaulted a woman. While on bail for the offending, HX became involved in counterfeiting currency. He was arrested and charged. As a result, HX was sentenced in 2019 to four months’ imprisonment and granted leave to apply for home detention on 18 counts of using forged documents and one of theft. The following year, the sexual assault matter came to an end and he was jailed for two years and eight months for unlawful sexual connection with a female over 16. While locked up, Immigration New Zealand served him with a deportation liability notice as a result of his offending. In 2021, HX filed an application for recognition as a refugee or protected person on the grounds he feared returning to Sri Lanka. He claimed to be afraid of the gang that was after him due to the 2013 fight, and that threats had been made against him by people who had heard he had been convicted of sexual offending. HX also said he would have a lack of family support in Sri Lanka. But his application was unsuccessful. In his recent appeal to the tribunal, he said he had converted to Christianity while in prison and began attending church when he was released in early 2022. His pastor provided a letter to the tribunal stating he had provided practical and emotional support to HX who has been without employment and accommodation. Tribunal chairperson, Judge Martin Treadwell, accepted HX’s submissions regarding his background but said his account of the fight in 2013 had evolved over time and it was “difficult to be certain as to the accuracy of the latest iteration of it”. In considering whether HX met the threshold for refugee or protected person status, the judge found there was no real chance of him being persecuted in Sri Lanka. Judge Treadwell accepted that many people would be aware of HX’s sexual offending in New Zealand and that they may ostracise him. But this did not amount to serious harm arising from breaches of human rights, he said. “He will need to work hard to regain trust and acceptance by the community. He may never achieve that with some people. Resettlement into his community will be difficult for him. “There is, however, no right to be liked by everyone.” The judge found HX had lived independently of his family for many years and so there was little weight in his lack of family support argument. In regards to the gang that was allegedly after him due to the 2013 fight, Judge Treadwell found there was nothing to suggest HX was at serious risk. The judge said the fight was a decade ago and “the heightened emotions of the time will have long since dissipated”. While HX did not raise any concerns about his conversion to Christianity, the tribunal considered it anyway and found nothing in Sri Lanka’s country information indicating he would face a real chance of serious harm due to his newfound beliefs. “For the above reasons, the tribunal is satisfied that the appellant does not face a real chance of serious harm arising from breaches of human rights in Sri Lanka. He does not have a well-founded fear of being persecuted there.” HX’s appeal was therefore dismissed. (New Zealand Herald)"

This discussion was prompted by the existing gap in monitoring certain business activities, such as tax payments. The committee convened in Parliament and engaged in discussions regarding the importance of establishing a robust regulatory mechanism for online businesses. Currently, there is a lack of formal mechanisms to oversee and regulate business activities conducted on the Internet, including aspects such as tax payments by companies operating in this domain. Recognising this gap, the committee emphasised the necessity of taking proactive steps to address this issue. During the discussions, it was proposed that the implementation of a legal framework, coupled with the introduction of a digital service tax, could effectively regulate online businesses. These measures would contribute to ensuring fairness, accountability, and compliance within this sector. Furthermore, the committee also explored the idea of promoting digital transactions as a viable alternative to traditional currency notes and coins. This initiative aligns with the objective of enhancing the Ease of Doing Business Index and further streamlining economic activities in the digital age. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

In the letter, Medhananda Thera said there is a risk of grave repercussions in the area if the lands surrounding the temple site end up in the hands of individuals who support divisive and racist ideologies. Referring to the Media reports that non-temple lands have already been distributed among the public, the Thera said distribution of lands could be inappropriate due to the presence of ruins from various Buddhist monasteries scattered around the site. Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe categorically denied claims suggesting his intention to settle a group of Tamil people on the land owned by the temple. The President addressed this matter during the launch ceremony of the new online passport application system held at the Homagama Divisional Secretariat yesterday (15).

AHEO National Convener, Disnaka Dissanayake, fielding questions yesterday (15), said there were questions as to the reason for the visible downturn in the efforts being made by the Anti-Malaria Campaign (AMC) to maintain the status earned from the World Health Organization (WHO) as a country which eliminated malaria.  He said, the WHO itself had noted that the island’s journey to eliminating the mosquito-borne disease had been tough, and had “demanded strict, responsive policies after malaria cases rose in the 1970s and 80s, in the 1990s.” Everyone from medical practitioners to minor employees worked alike toward that goal. However, the situation has seen a downward trend even before ten years had lapsed after receiving the certificate from the WHO. Dissanayake lamented that there was a breakdown in surveillance so much so that there had even been a malaria death with occurred in April this year. A malaria death that occurred 10 years after the last case of endemic malaria was reported in the country. Another incident was also reported two weeks before when a fever patient who had later been diagnosed with malaria had been to the AMC office to undergo a malaria test. Unfortunately, the lifts had not been operational as it had been the weekend while the said patient had to climb up the stairs to the sixth floor of the building in which the AMC office was situated only to collapse once he reached the particular floor. Here too only one person had been present even to take a blood sample for testing from that patient. Speaking further, Dissanayake said there should also be a regular parasite survey to mainly ensure vector control. Unfortunately, neither the Health Ministry nor the Director of the AMC seemed interested in continuing to maintain a country free of malaria let alone maintaining the recognition Sri Lanka earned from the WHO, the AHEO’s National Convenor alleged.

This recommendation was brought at the Western Province sub-committee, responsible for curbing the dengue outbreak chaired by State Minister Dr. Seetha Arambepola, who is the Chairperson of the Dengue Control Expert Committee. This recommendation, focused on minimising the risk of mosquito bites, should not be a burden for the parents, it was noted and the Ministry of Education would actively engage with schools to disseminate this recommendation.  Dr. Arambepola spoke on the importance of safeguarding fever patients from mosquitoes. The Minister highlighted that dengue, a disease transmitted through mosquitoes, can be passed from one infected person to another. She emphasised the need to raise awareness among the public regarding the protection of both dengue-infected patients and individuals with fever until a confirmed diagnosis is obtained. In response to the escalating dengue crisis, President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently appointed a ministerial committee and an expert committee dedicated to dengue control. The expert committee promptly appointed nine provincial sub-committees, one of which is chaired by State Minister Dr. Arambepola. The primary focus of the Western Province sub-committee’s meeting revolved around taking immediate measures to effectively control the dengue outbreak within a few days. State Minister Arambepola led discussions on the urgency of implementing necessary steps to combat the disease and minimise its transmission. Further, the State Minister emphasised that the present situation presents an opportunity to promptly address the carriers and levels of the virus through immediate measures. Instructing the National Dengue Control Unit, guidelines were issued to control dengue in the vicinity of hospitals. The Unit was directed to create designated areas exclusively for fever patients (Fever Corners) as well as for patients diagnosed with dengue, with the aim of preventing the spread of the disease within hospitals. Additionally, steps were advised to disseminate information regarding the risk of dengue transmission, through text messages. The State Minister has announced a comprehensive plan to allocate five days a week for inspecting schools, places of worship, State and private institutions, commercial premises, and abandoned plots, which are notorious breeding grounds for dengue mosquitoes. To facilitate this effort, the State Minister has enlisted the support of the Police and Armed Forces for spot checks. She has advised the relevant departments to coordinate these inspections effectively. Further, raising awareness about the use of mosquito repellents has been proposed as an effective measure. Dr. Arambepola acknowledged the valuable contribution of the “dengue groups” in the fight against Covid-19. She expressed her commitment to addressing any challenges faced by these groups and emphasised the need to strengthen their efforts to combat dengue. Their support will be crucial in the ongoing dengue control measures. Recognising the significance of the situation, the State Minister advised local government commissioners to address the issues faced by Medical Officers of Health (MOH) and provide them with the necessary facilities. Additionally, it was suggested that regional health directors actively participate in the weekly meetings of the sub-committee, allowing them to remain updated through discussions with MOHs and Public Health Inspectors (PHI).

Ordinary Level Examination and the Grade Five Scholarship Examination. During the first discussion of the expert committee appointed to support the Ministerial Committee for the national education policy framework on Wednesday (14), President Wickremesinghe also said there is a need for fixed examination periods and announced his intention to legally establish a specific month for the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination. Any changes to the fixed schedule would require submission to Parliament for approval, except in cases of extreme emergencies such as pandemics or Tsunamis, he said and highlighted the preparation of corresponding laws. Drawing inspiration from the progress achieved by developed nations, the President stressed the importance of establishing a robust education system and cultivating a skilled workforce to accomplish the objectives of becoming a developed country by 2048. He acknowledged the significance of aligning the country’s human resources, enhancing the education system, and transforming the nation into a regional education hub. To facilitate this, the ‘Education Ministerial Committee’ was formed, chaired by President Ranil Wickremesinghe comprising ten members. Additionally, a sub-committee was appointed to support the reforms in five key areas, including early childhood education, primary and secondary education, higher education, vocational training, and information technology. Amidst the discussions, urgent amendments to the education system were extensively deliberated upon, with a focus on equipping the future generation to overcome upcoming challenges and build a skilled workforce. In addition, the President emphasised the imperative of advancing education and technology while maintaining the standard of the school system. Special attention was given to the measures required to enhance the English skills of schoolchildren. Recognising the significance of the quality of education, the President stressed the need for established standards in both government and private schools. To achieve this, the operation of inspectorates was deemed necessary. Further, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the urgency for immediate changes in the vocational training sector. Acknowledging that a trained workforce is essential for a country’s development, he underscored the importance of rapid transformations in Sri Lanka’s vocational training sector to meet the demands of the upcoming labour market. President Wickremesinghe further said a comprehensive long-term economic philosophy should precede discussions on education. Emphasising the interdependence of education and economic growth, he outlined the aim to overcome short-term debt and achieve a sustained economic growth rate of 8 per cent to 9 per cent within three years, maintained for at least a decade. Such progress is pivotal for propelling the country forward. The President highlighted several factors influencing the rate of economic growth, emphasising the importance of scaling up products and drawing inspiration from successful examples such as Malaysia, China, and Singapore. However, he also emphasised the need for a phased approach, recognising that immediate transformation on par with Singapore’s development is not feasible. However, the President said Sri Lanka needs to look at automation to meet the labour shortage within the next ten years, so that Sri Lanka would have a highly automated labour force and become the automated manufacturing hub in this region. Highlighting human resources as the primary resource for this journey, the President referred to the examples of South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and India, which have achieved development through the effective utilisation of human capital. The path to such goals needs to be carefully planned and determined. Therefore, the convergence of education, economic framework, and climate change was identified as crucial. Only through competitiveness can the country progress towards a highly competitive economy, which remains the ultimate objective. The discussion was attended by President’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Prime Minister’s Secretary Anura Dissanayake, and members of the Education Expert Committee."

Unfortunately, neither the Health Ministry nor the Director of the AMC seemed interested in continuing to maintain a country free of malaria let alone maintaining the recognition Sri Lanka earned from the WHO, the AHEO’s National Convenor alleged.

Further, Ambassador Perera deeply appreciated the support Japan continues to extend to Sri Lanka at all international forums and also utilising the many tools at the disposal of Japanese agencies to support Sri Lanka’s economy bilaterally. He informed the audience that Sri Lanka is exploring collaborations with Japanese companies to increase production, provide goods and services, and modernise industrial and agricultural industries while developing closer bilateral cooperation to use its ports as shipping hubs for Japanese products and services in the South Asian region. Joining the seminar online, Naoshi Yamada, Managing Director of Metatechno Lanka Pvt. Ltd., having invested in Sri Lanka in a successful venture, shared his positive experience in doing business in Sri Lanka in the IT sector, while Arunya de Silva from the Investment Promotion Division of the Board of Investment (BOI) explained in detail why Sri Lanka is an attractive investment destination.

According to the MP, Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Vidura Wickremanayake, should take responsibility and resign, as he is believed to be the main figure responsible for the land issues in the North and East. During a Media briefing held on Wednesday (14), the MP emphasised that it is Minister Wickremanayake who is the Cabinet Minister overseeing cultural affairs, which includes the Department of Archaeology. The MP highlighted that most of the land issues in the North and East can be traced back to the involvement of the Minister, contrary to the President’s statement urging the Director General to adhere to Cabinet policies. The MP argued that instead of using the Director General as a scapegoat, it is Minister Wickremanayake who should be asked to resign to truly resolve the land matter. Rasamanickam further mentioned instances in the past where photographic evidence clearly shows the Minister leading land operations in the North and East, while officials from the Archaeological Department have lodged complaints regarding land issues with the Minister. “Despite personal discussions with the Minister, no action was taken to address the matter. The Minister even invited the MP to his Ministry, but later claimed ignorance and promised to halt land surveying, although there is evidence of the Minister’s active involvement,” he said. Further, the MP alleged that the Minister neglects to attend any meetings related to archaeological sites, thereby undermining the effectiveness of recent actions taken by the President, which resulted in the Director General’s resignation. The MP emphasised that as long as a Minister like Wickremanayake remains in power, the country’s national policy against land grabbing cannot be effectively implemented. Prof. Manatunga, on 12 June, was accused of disregarding Cabinet policy. In a recent meeting, the President warned Manatunga that adherence to policy decisions made by Cabinet is essential, as failure to comply may lead to non-compliance with national policy as well.

Addressing the Media from the Opposition Leader’s Office in Colombo, the SJB MP said when Gotabaya Rajapaksa became the President in 2019; he went on reversing previous Gazettes, resulting in State revenue being reduced by one-third. But in a tragicomic situation, his successor reverses other laws and legislations, threatening the very fabric of democracy. “While the Government is introducing various anti-democratic and anti-people Bills, it is also creating problems regarding race and religion, threatening ethnic and religious harmony in the country,” Wickramaratne warned. The MP emphasised that the people are waiting for the best laws to eliminate corruption and fraud because they are tired of corruption, theft and fraud in this country. “Sri Lanka went bankrupt for the first time under the leaders of the present regime. But now the parties responsible for it are trying to bring the above laws. People are wondering why this group that destroyed the country is manipulating matters once more,” he said. He also advised the Government that when going to discuss amendments with regard to the IMF agreement in September, the tax-free limit imposed on the working people should be raised to Rs 200,000 from the present tax-free threshold of Rs 100,000 due to the economic hardships faced by the masses.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

This was revealed at the recently held Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) meeting in Parliament. During the meeting, COPA expressed its displeasure at the delay in the work as recommended by the committee previously that a new legislation be prepared in accordance with international standards to replace the existing Act establishing the Prisons Department. Upuldeniya told COPA that the prison inmates have increased and this figure is generally 259 per cent and in some prisons this figure has increased by 300 per cent – 400 per cent. Accordingly, although there is room for only 11,762 inmates in the prisons, 26,791 inmates are currently in prisons, Secretary to the Justice Ministry, Wasantha Perera revealed. Out of this number, 17,502 are remand prisoners and 10,470 of them are drug-related offenders. Furthermore, the Commissioner General of Prisons said that there are 9,289 people who have been convicted by the court and 3,569 of them are drug-related offenders. It was also revealed that 1,309 of them are in prison for not being able to pay fines. Additional Commissioner General of Prisons Chandana Ekanayake said it is a huge problem that people who cannot pay fines are released under special amnesty on occasions like Vesak and Poson Festivals. It was also revealed that the number of drug-related offenders has increased rapidly. According to this, rehabilitation work will be done in nine new centres, said the Commissioner General of Prisons. The Committee also informed the officials to quickly prepare and submit the necessary proposals and plans to control this situation. Out of the total number of 7,872 employees, there are 1,663 vacancies. COPA Chair instructed to complete these as well as to present related plans and proposals if an increase in the total number of employees is required. Furthermore, four of the 11 machines that are used to body check and check the bags of goods in the prison were out of order. Officials pointed out that since these machines are more than 10-years-old, it is profitable to buy new machines compared to the cost of repair. Accordingly, the COPA Chair instructed officers to submit a plan regarding the necessary machines for all prisons. Due to the ‘jammer’ that disables telephone signals in the prison, attention was drawn to the fact that signals are not working in the surrounding areas as well. The Commissioner General of Prisons said that these activities are currently being carried out by the Sri Lanka Signal Corps and that a technology that works accurately only for the relevant area is currently available in developed countries.

The Summit will highlight the urgency of finding solutions to the multiple crises plaguing the global community. These crises range from climate change and biodiversity loss to the on-going impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, escalating conflicts, and growing inequality.

Recognising the need for a new financial pact to confront these challenges, President Macron extended an invitation to President Wickremesinghe, emphasising the importance of collective action. The Summit aims to establish a shared vision for reforming the multilateral financial sector and charting a path towards a decarbonized global economy that aligns with the SDGs.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/15/csr-project-proposed-by-adani-unclear/,CSR project proposed by Adani unclear,Author not found,0,2023-06-14T20:33:00+00:00," The Northern Province MPs strongly questioned Jaffna/Kilinochchi District Coordinating Committee Chairman and Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda regarding the lack of clarity in the proposed Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project of the Adani Green Energy project, which aims to install a 234MW wind power facility in Pooneryn. The discussions also revealed that the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is not ready and there is lack of clarity when it comes to the CSR project proposed by Adani.  The MPs refused to approve the project, demanding further details, on Tuesday (13), while Minister Devananda insisted on proceeding with the approval, citing his authority as the committee’s chairman. During the heated argument on Tuesday, MPs M.A. Sumanthiran, S. Sritharan, and Angajan Ramanathan raised concerns about the lack of clarity regarding the CSR  project promised by Adani Green Energy for the benefit of the people in Pooneryn. An Adani representative at the committee meeting outlined the CSR initiatives, including road renovation, education and health support for the local hospital, mobile clinics and ambulances, livelihood support for fisher families, and the provision of a smart room for an elementary school. However, the MPs insisted on clearer details regarding the CSR project, stating that the agreement paper did not provide sufficient information. Sumanthiran specifically questioned the consequences if the road project were to fail or be inadequately implemented. He emphasised the need for accountability and clarity regarding the contractor responsible for the road and the repercussions for the wind power developers. Sumanthiran raised concerns about the utilisation of the proposed 20km road by the community and stressed the importance of clarifying the responsibilities of the contractor and the consequences faced by the wind power developers if they failed to fulfil their commitments.  Ramanathan echoed these concerns, emphasising the number of ambulances and what equipment would be provided to the Pooneryn Base Hospital as mentioned in the CSR project. Sritharan expressed skepticism about the benefits of a smart room for elementary school-children promised by the Adanis. Sumanthiran said similar facilities provided in Sri Lanka remained non-functional due to a lack of trained teachers and difficulties in maintenance. Sritharan suggested providing a park or playground to foster natural development is far better than smart room. Despite Minister Devananda’s assertion that he had the authority to approve the CSR project, the MPs strongly disagreed. Ramanathan insisted on obtaining a comprehensive CSR project proposal and a list of commitments from Adani before considering approval. He emphasised the importance of raising awareness about the wind power mill installation and understanding the conditions and execution plans.  “There are four houses in that area and they are located on State land. We are looking to relocated them with a land and Rs. 2 million as compensation and another Rs. 1.5 million to build a house on that new location Adani has agreed to,” said the Minister.  “What else can we ask for?  These members in the committee all the time want to create a ruckus and confuse and that’s what they had done in the past.  My final say is that make use of the opportunity for the betterment of the people and the country” he said. Ramanathan added that the project should focus on improving the livelihoods of the downtrodden people in the area, demanding written clarity and accountability for the consequences of inadequate implementation in the proposed CSR. He reiterated that the project would not be approved until such details were provided. In response to the MPs’ demands, Minister Devananda agreed to wait for the final recommendations and decide on approval accordingly. He criticized the MPs, accusing them of creating unnecessary conflicts and hindering the project’s progress for their own political agendas. He emphasized the importance of considering the benefits the project would bring to the people and the country. The government officials at the meeting expressed the government’s desire to commence the project by December 2024, citing the need for a proper road, education, healthcare, and employment opportunities in Pooneryn. Sumanthiran recalled the previous case of the Maruthankerni road, which ended up in disrepair after the Road Development Authority (RDA) received funds for the project. He questioned who was responsible for quality assurance and who paid the contractor. The road deteriorated within three months, he added. At the meeting it was agreed to include a clause that would establish a monetary agreement between the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and RDA to address defaults in road implementation. Sumanthiran emphasized that it is crucial to penalize those who fail to fulfill their commitments, as many projects make assurances but are not properly implemented. Addressing the CSR aspect, an Adani official who arrived from India stated that they would conduct topographic surveys to design the rest. They would provide the detailed designs to the relevant authorities for validation he said. He assured   Sumanthiran that they will adhere to the agreement specified to the RDA when constructing the road. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Kariyawasam’s statements came in the backdrop of Prof. Anura Manatunga, Director of the Archaeology Department tendering his resignation after being pulled up by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. He was speaking at a media briefing at Sirikotha. Kariyawasam said these two institutions should be merged and run in a modern manner. To develop tourism, new rules and regulations should be introduced for such institutions and he also said the Antiquities Ordinance should be amended and the existing outdated rules should be changed. Kariyawasam while pointing out the shortcomings of the Department said permission has even to be obtained from the Archaeology Department when building a new toilet. He said while protecting archaeological sites, ways and means to benefit the country from those sites must be put in place. “Today archaeology is considered as a management subject in the world and accordingly, archaeology should be managed in a way that does not affect the lives of the people while protecting the archaeological monuments,” he stressed. He said when he was the Cabinet minister in charge of archaeology during the good-governance government, several programmes were initiated to generate income from archaeological sites but the opposition at that time had different opinions against it. Kariyawasam said that even now the opposition has run out of topics to talk about and thus they are trying to carry out their politics by using archaeology. BY Amith Maduranga Gamage"

MCPA President Chamal Sanjeewa yesterday (14) accused the Ministry Secretary of initiating investigations against the Administration of the Hospital due to a survey conducted under his guidance on the expenditure the Ministry incurred by granting permission to administrators of State Hospitals to carry out local purchasing. According to the survey it had been revealed that the Health Ministry footed a bill which was 16% more than it would through the normal procurement procedure. Dr. Sanjeewa accused the Health Ministry of having been unable to provide a large quantity of medicinal drugs required by patients being treated by the NINDT during the past year. As a solution, it had instructed the hospitals to carry out local purchasing from the private sector. Due to the sudden purchase of medicinal drugs from private pharmacies, the Health Ministry spent 16% more than amount spent by the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) on one medicinal drugs and vials of medicines through normal procurement procedures. He said the survey had also presented the importance of purchasing medicines with the intervention of philanthropists. “This survey was conducted after sifting through several medicines related to kidney disease by focusing on medicines which were frequently used in the hospital and which have to be purchased externally,” the MCPA President explained. The NINDT had taken steps to informed all specialist doctors and pharmacists and also submitted the report of the survey carried out to the Director General of Health Services (DGHS). The NINDT Director also took measures on an earlier occasion to submit proposals through the MCPA to the Sub Committee on Health, Ruwan Wickremasinghe, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and Presidential Secretary Saman Ekanayake on how to purchase medicinal drugs at a low cost from India instead of carrying out emergency purchasing. Dr. Sanjeeva noted that at that time the Presidential Secretary had informed him that although the proposals were beneficial to the country they could not be implemented due to the actions of certain officials. He accused politicians and officials of the Health Ministry of working with vested interests instead of discussing such positive proposals and implementing them in practice. The MCPA President alleged that Health Ministry had also initiated an investigation against the President of the Pharmacists’ Association, Ajith Thilakaratne, for allegedly revealing facts regarding the increase in pharmaceutical prices and the shortage of medicinal drugs in the country.

The intervention petition is filed in the public interest. It refers to serious allegations of irregularity, mishandling, sabotage, bribery and corruption surrounding the claim for compensation arising from the X-Press Pearl disaster. The key points that have been raised in the intervention petition are the grave allegations of interference and extraneous pressure surrounding the claim for compensation arising from the X-Press Pearl disaster, the statement by the Justice Minister in Parliament on 25 April 2023 that one Chamara Gunasekara alias Manjusiri Nissanka had received a payment of USD 250 million into a private bank account in connection with the X-Press Pearl disaster, the media statements of Chinthaka Waragoda, who reportedly invented a machine to remove debris which washed ashore after the shipwreck, alleging that he was offered payment to discontinue the use of his machine, to avoid exposing the full extent of the damage caused by the disaster and questions surrounding the quantum of compensation due to Sri Lanka for the damages caused by MV X-Press Pearl. The freight ship ‘MV X-Press Pearl’ caught fire off the coast of Colombo on 20 May 2021. It sank a few days later, releasing its cargo of plastic pellets and tons of toxic chemicals into the ocean, causing Sri Lanka’s worst maritime disaster to date. It is alleged that Sri Lankan authorities obtained the assistance of the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited (ITOPF), a representative of the insurer of the Ship’s owner, in the post-disaster activities, despite the grave conflict of interest arising from it. TISL has urged that the private parties involved in the X-Press Pearl incident be held accountable and be made to pay optimal compensation for the damage and pollution caused to the marine and coastal ecology of Sri Lanka and the payment of compensation for the loss caused to the fishing communities and those engaged in tourism, as well as obtaining compensation under the Marine Pollution Prevention Act. TISL has also highlighted the need to hold anyone guilty of wrongdoing fully accountable. The petition for intervention is to be mentioned for Support in the Supreme Court tomorrow (15)."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/14/vehicle-import-restrictions-hamper-customs-revenue-target/,Vehicle Import Restrictions Hamper Customs Revenue Target,Author not found,0,2023-06-13T20:33:00+00:00," Sri Lanka Customs is currently struggling to achieve the revenue targets set for 2023 due to the imposition of import restrictions on vehicles. As a result, the Customs could only rake in a revenue of Rs 783 billion, instead of the originally set target of Rs 1.2 trillion. That too, would be challenging, if the vehicle import ban continues because only Rs 355 billion has been collected during the last five months, the Customs said. This was disclosed by the Sri Lanka Customs officials at the recent meeting of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Economic and Physical Plans, chaired by MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage The committee discussed the potential contributions of the Sri Lanka Customs towards increasing State revenue. During the meeting, the Customs officials emphasised that as long as the import restrictions remain in place, they will struggle to achieve their revenue goals. They said the projected revenue for this year is Rs 783 billion, but it will be challenging to reach this target with the current import restrictions. The officials highlighted that approximately 20 per cent of their revenue is derived from taxes collected on vehicle imports. To illustrate this, they provided data showing that in 2018, Sri Lanka Customs generated tax revenue of Rs 923 billion, the highest sum between 2014 and 2022. Out of this total, Rs 194 billion was collected through vehicle taxes. They further stated that if the import restrictions on vehicles are relaxed this month, it is estimated that Rs 150 billion can be earned from vehicle import taxes alone over the next six months. The officials suggested if vehicle imports are resumed through a foreign Credit Line, the Customs revenue could be increased. If it is successful they would be able to obtain Rs 1.1 trillion in revenue, they claimed. In response, Aluthgamage said the government is currently holding discussions with regard to the matter and a decision on resuming the importation of vehicles would be taken soon.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/14/no-input-from-national-security-authorities-pmd/,No input from National Security authorities – PMD,Author not found,0,2023-06-13T20:33:00+00:00,"The report compiled by the Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on National Security chaired by Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara pertaining to the risks involved in the privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) did not involve any inquiry with the relevant authorities responsible for national security, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said. According to the PMD, the matter was discussed during the National Security Council (NSC) meeting held yesterday (13). The report of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security was presented to Parliament by Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara on 9 June. The report prepared on the privatisation of SLT, said privatisation is not recommended given the possible leakage of matters sensitive to national security. Meanwhile, speaking during the ‘101 Katha’ talk show hosted by the PMD, former Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) Professor Rohan Samarajiva assured that the privatisation of SLT does not pose a threat to national security. Speaking on the said report, Prof. Samarajiva said it relies on assumptions and has turned “national security” into a mere slogan. He further said the report lacks a professional study and contradicts the standards set by the Sectoral Oversight Committee. He pointed out the ignorance of both the present and the past, emphasising that during the 1990s, Sri Lanka invited numerous firms, including Sri Lanka Telecom, which, at that time, did not possess a mobile phone network. “Despite Mobitel being owned by an Australian company, the management rights were retained by an Australian company, and Mobitel had a history of serving the Government due to the telecom firm’s ownership. Additionally, the operations of Mobitel were overseen by Telstra Corporation, a Japanese business was responsible for telecommunications, and the majority of decisions were made by Japanese CEOs, even though the Chairman of Telecom was Sri Lankan. Amid the conflict, Sri Lanka had four mobile phone providers and three fixed phone businesses, with Dialog being the only corporation with a Sri Lankan CEO, although it was fully owned by Malaysia,” he said. Also, Prof. Samarajiva said the phrase “national security” was being repeated without proper examination, suggesting that it had become a mere mantra or slogan. He emphasised that when the Government solely owned the telecom firm, all foreign calls were routed through the telecom headquarters in Colombo, and any harm to it would isolate Sri Lanka from the international community. Further, he explained that even with cables and satellites, if the software system failed, the entire network would be disrupted, as there was no alternative system in place. He cited two bomb attacks by the LTTE that occurred on the same day to underscore the national security threat faced by the Government-controlled telecom. Following privatisation, Prof. Samarajiva recommended that a Japanese corporation develop a backup system, which was promptly implemented, thanks to their investment. “A government agency could not have achieved what the Japanese firm did, as most government organisations do not prioritise infrastructure security due to limited funds. He suggested that privatisation, with appropriate controls, allows for investment and urged authorities to consider their recommendations seriously.” Citing an example, he mentioned a case where Telecom and the Japanese corporation faced a one-million-dollar loss due to a mistake, but the customer was refunded. He also pointed out that during the 1990s, there was a monopoly on international calls, but now international connections are no longer solely dependent on telecom. He highlighted the use of Gmail for government communication and emphasised that the majority of government information is transmitted through the Gmail domain, which is foreign-owned.  Additionally, politicians and government officials use WhatsApp, which is also owned by a foreign entity, to communicate. Prof. Samarajiva argued that privatisation does not mean government data is being compromised since data centres in Sri Lanka, including those of the Telecom Company and Dialog, are rented to store government data. He used the analogy of renting a part of a safety deposit box in a bank, where the control lies with the individual who leases the safe, not the bank. Thus, only the authorised personnel have access to government databases, and having a copy of the data stored outside Sri Lanka enhances security.

The foot may be turned inward or downward, making it difficult for the child to place the foot flat on the ground. This malformation can affect one foot or both feet. Globally, statistics show that approximately one child in every 800 births is born with this condition. However, with early diagnosis and proper treatment, about 95 per cent of these children can be completely cured. Dr. Akalanka Jayasinghe, an Orthopedic Surgeon at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Specialised Children’s Hospital, emphasised the importance of parents bringing their children to the hospital for assessment and participating in the clinics. By doing so, the hospital can evaluate the condition of the children and provide them with the necessary treatment. The walk organised on World Clubfoot Day aimed to create awareness about clubfoot and promote early detection and treatment. BY D. Wanniarachchi – Menikhinna"

He made this remarks during a meeting held in Mihintale. Fernando, who addressed certain allegations made against the Rajapaksa family, emphasised the importance of proving these allegations before spreading them on social media platforms. He urged for a fair investigation and prosecution rather than the spread of false information. He recalled previous claims, in 2015, that the Rajapaksas owned 19 Lamborghinis, which were supposedly imported through the port. However, the same individual who made these allegations later retracted his statement and instead claimed the presence of golden horses and money in Uganda, Fernando added. He mentioned witnessing young protesters holding banners during that period, accusing the Rajapaksas of massive corruption. He calculated the astronomical figures mentioned in those accusations and pointed out that they could buy the entire world and land on Mars. He questioned the credibility of such claims. Fernando defended former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, highlighting his significant voter support as an individual due to his role in developing the country and successfully combating terrorism during his tenure. He asserted that attacks against Mahinda were an attempt to undermine the strong leadership he represents. Fernando argued that a strong leader is vital to preserve a country’s culture, and those who slander the leaders are, in fact, attacking the cultural fabric of the nation. He emphasised that Mahinda Rajapaksa is deeply ingrained in the hearts of the people because he cannot be controlled or manipulated by any external influence."

ACAF National Organiser Namal Karunaratne told Ceylon Today, the Government has distributed 65 per cent of fertiliser vouchers to farmers, but 100 per cent should have been distributed by now. He said the Yala Season is going on and some places are close to harvesting, but the Government is still distributing fertiliser vouchers and this puts immense pressure on farmers. He also said there is still no fixed price for fertiliser and if you go to ten different shops, they would quote ten different prices. “Despite the Government selling a fertiliser bundle to the farmer for Rs 8,000 per acre, a fertiliser bundle being sold for Rs 12,000 outside is a big tragedy,” he said. He pointed out that since there is no price regulation for the acreage, weed killers and insecticides, unfair profits are being made in the black market and farmers still sell the old paddy for Rs 70. “If the old paddy is sold for the above price, the farmers are under a lot of pressure as to how much the paddy price will fall in the future,” he added.

Or do you want me to teach you?” Several Tamil politicians from the North and the East, including MPs M.A. Sumanthiran, S.

During the discussion, the President posed several questions to Prof. Manatunga regarding the alleged acquisition of a massive 300,000-acre land, without the approval of the Archaeology Department. The Professor clarified that they do not have the authority to own such lands, but there is an issue concerning land in the Eastern Province where they have only demarcated the area without taking it over. The Archaeology Department explained that some portions of the land were originally designated as forest and wildlife areas, but they are currently occupied by a Buddhist temple. They assured that they would revisit the site to take necessary action. The President expressed concern over the occupation of such a large land by a temple on state-owned land. The Professor reiterated that they have not claimed any ownership of the land in question. The President further questioned whether the Archaeology Department could teach him Sri Lanka’s history, or if he should be the one teaching them. This particular discussion gained significant attention on social media platforms. The acquisition of land by the Archaeology Department in the North and East has sparked controversy in the region in recent times.

GMOA General Secretary Haritha Aluthge yesterday (12) said his outfit had taken several decisions during a GMOA Central Committee meeting with regard to the 2014/15 A/Level batches who had even passed out of medical faculties and were awaiting internship appointments. However, the Health Ministry has continued to delay giving these appointments, while there were allegations being levelled against certain Health Ministry officials in this regard. The only way in which these allegations and suspicions could be abated was for the Ministry to take immediate measures in sanctioning intern appointments for these two batches. The 2014/15 A/L batches comprise those who qualified from local medical faculties in August 2022 while there are approximately 180 medical graduates who passed out from foreign universities early this year awaiting internship appointments. The Health Ministry had, he said, only issued the first announcement with regard to the Internship appointments due to the pressure from the GMOA. However, it was yet unable to announce the appointed dates for online applications, the date for awarding of the internships, and the date when Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) would be officially notified in this regard. Dr. Aluthge lamented that the present batch of Interns would complete their service period on 27 June 2023 while the batches that take over from them should have at least one week to work alongside their seniors. He said that it was only then that the results would be more satisfactory. But for all this there only a very limited time period left. It has prompted the GMOA Central Committee to decide on several trade union measures of which one is to express serious opposition against the responsible officials. Dr. Aluthge said his outfit would also pressure officials to announce a specific time period during which all details to be completed and the appointments to be made. He warned that the union would resort to a strike after 19 June 2023 if the Ministry failed to award the internships before the current interns completed service. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Speaking in Parliament last week, Dr. de Silva, quoting the latest findings of LIRNEasia, a Colombo-based think-tank, claimed that the people are in this situation thanks to misguided policies of the Government led by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He highlighted the profound impact of this dire situation on the daily lives of families. “It is deeply concerning that 47 per cent of households have been compelled to reduce their food consumption in order to make ends meet.” The consequences of poverty extend far beyond hunger, the MP said and emphasised that in 27 per cent of households, parents have been forced to sacrifice their own meals to ensure that their children are fed. Equally troubling is the fact that six per cent of households with children aged 5-18 has been unable to send their kids to school, he said.  “About half the boys in the nearby estate have dropped out of school. They take on odd jobs in the area and can earn about Rs 200 if someone calls them,” he said. Speaking further, he called for a united effort among MPs to raise awareness and support initiatives aimed at alleviating this crisis. He emphasised that no child should go hungry or be deprived of an education.  (SM)"

The World Oceans Day of this year was celebrated on the theme ‘Planet Ocean: Tides are Changing’. Following the directives of the Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, the Sri Lanka Navy is actively involved in planting mangroves in estuaries, lagoons, and rivers as part of its ongoing mangrove conservation project across all Naval commands. The recent initiative was yet another milestone of the timely project, organised by the Southeastern Naval Command. The mangrove ecosystem plays a significant role in safeguarding the biodiversity of the coastal ecosystem.The distinct ecosystem serves as a fertile habitat for a wide variety of fish species, offering significant benefits to the fishing community too. Additionally, the ability of mangroves to absorb carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases highlights the importance of preserving and expanding these habitats in effectively mitigating global warming in the long run. The mangrove ecosystem also plays an essential role in limiting the waste that finds its way into our precious oceans. They also stand against the relentless forces of erosion, safeguarding the coastal environment in lagoons, rivers, and estuaries. Moreover, mangroves can even contribute to air purification, ensuring mankind can breathe in fresh and clean air. Realising the immense value of these guardians of our coastal belt, the Sri Lanka Navy often throws its weight behind initiatives that are set in motion to protect the mangrove ecosystem. A group of senior and junior officers and sailors from the Southeastern Naval Command actively took part in this mangrove planting efforts."

Rasamanickam expressed disappointment, stressing that despite clearly highlighting the political and fundamental rights issues of the Tamil people to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, their concerns seemed to have fallen on deaf ears. He lamented that the problems faced by the Tamil people remain unresolved despite continuous pressure being exerted on the Government regarding this matter. Rasamanickam mentioned that during a meeting with President Wickremesinghe, he and a delegation from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) had explained the continued agitations of the Tamils, but feared that their concerns were not being heard. He further said they have given President Wickremesinghe a ‘deadline’ until 30 June to propose an acceptable solution to the problems faced by the Tamil people. If he fails to do so, they will take the matter to the international stage soon. However, Rasamanickam expressed confidence that President Wickremesinghe, who frequently emphasises unity and reconciliation, will recommend a sustainable solution to address the pressing issues faced by the Tamil community.

Citing examples to the media at the Opposition Leader’s Office in Colombo, he said three persons charged with corruption, bribery and money laundering in Sri Lanka were fined and punished by the Courts of foreign countries. However, to date, the Rajapaksa Governments have not dealt with those officials who are their cronies and relatives, although they were fined in overseas judiciaries, stressed Wickramaratne. Wickramaratne also said the proposed Act aims to send a complainant to prison for a maximum period of 10 years if the person making a complaint about corruption cannot prove the allegation. He, therefore, asked whether it is an Anti-Corruption Bill or rather an Anti-Whistleblower Bill. Giving examples of Government duplicity, the SJB MP said significant marine pollution was caused by the MV X-Press Pearl disaster. The Justice Minister said USD 250 million was paid to a person to suppress the MV X-Press Pearl case. But the Government has not taken any action regarding such accusations. “Therefore, even if the new Anti-Corruption Bill comes into being, there will be reasonable doubt whether the Government will take measures to combat corruption in the country,” Wickramaratne said. Recently, an MP who smuggled gold and mobile phones through the airport’s VIP Lounge was released after paying only 10 per cent of the fine imposed on an ordinary citizen of this country who tried to smuggle gold of a similar quantity. The Opposition MP claimed that if two persons were fined differently for similar kinds of offenses, he queried whether the proposed Anti-Corruption Bill of the Government would be used to catch thieves in the country. Further, a lot of corruption allegations were made on the awarding of contracts for the construction of expressways. “Allowing time to pass, under the guise that these are mere accusations led to loss of people’s trust in the Government,” Wickramaratne warned. If those who have been accused of corruption and theft are not found guilty of those crimes, they should be exonerated and set free without further damaging their image, he advised the Government. “The main promise of the Rajapaksa Government during the last General Election was to bring to book the Central Bank Treasury (T) Bond scammers. The Rajapaksas went around the country and said the country lost billions of rupees due to the Bond Scam by a UNP-led Government. Therefore, the Government should prosecute such accused or else the Government should declare that they are innocent of such accusations without adding black marks to them,” the Opposition MP said.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/13/over-200-consultants-staying-in-service-beyond-retirement-age-gmof/,Over 200 consultants staying in service beyond retirement age – GMOF,Author not found,0,2023-06-12T20:30:00+00:00," A group of doctors accused the Health Ministry and the Government of enacting a political drama to assist over 200 consultants to extend their age of retirement. Secretary of the Government Medical Officers’ Forum (GMOF), Dr. Niroshana Premaratne yesterday (12) accused 249 consultants of attempting to instill fear in order to continue in the State health service beyond retirement age, when according to Government policy, the age of compulsory retirement from Government service is 60 years. “The one thing that the Health Minister had failed to note was the hidden agenda of those who have reached their retirement age and are occupying the best hospitals in the country such as the National Hospitals, Colombo and Kandy, the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Castle Street Hospital for Women, Teaching Hospitals Kalubowila, Karapitiya, Jaffna, Anuradhapura etc.” Dr. Premaratne noted that these stations were associated with profitable private practices which was the main reason for creating fear in the minds of health authorities and the public that medical practitioners were jumping ship creating a dire need for them to remain in service. The GMOF Secretary lamented that it had only resulted in young specialists being forced to serve in peripheries in remote areas, in so call difficult low facility areas, for prolonged periods with no chances of moving to easier stations of service. As a result their children are unable to obtain a good education in a good school while their families languish. Pandering to the needs of these specialists, who are staying on by force, the media have noted that hospitals and Units were shutting down due to lack of doctors for them to function. Specialist and medical officers leaving the country had created stage setting for those who want to continue in service to justify their action. He said that the Cabinet of Ministers were facing a dilemma as a result while the Health Minister had grossly failed to implement a government policy, leave alone defend it through the Health Ministry’s Legal Department, while he (the Minister) had also failed to understand that any decision taken to extend the age of retirement for doctors was being manipulated by one of its senior secretaries, who was also over 60 years, Dr. Premaratne said. “Hence the younger consultants opt to leave the country leaving behind the elderly consultants who are on the verge of retirement. “Doctors leaving the country in search of greener pastures is nothing new, infact, it has been reported that around 500 doctors have left the country in 12 months.  As far as the GMOF remembers – since the ‘80s a considerable numbers of medical practitioners have left the island annually. There is an outcry from the media attributing this to the economic crisis plus political instability in the country, he said noting that this was false impression. “We, as the GMOF, see the doctors leaving the countryas a positive move to increase its foreign revenue,” Dr. Premaratne observed noting however that the Health service had miserably failed to produce human resource so it could export the excess. The GMOF Secretary noted however that the country was not too late to increase the output from its nine medical faculties. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

As a result, the attention of the caucus was drawn to the need of converting the Ayati National Centre for clinical treatment of children with special needs, into an approved charity institution. Furthermore, they also discussed the proposals to appoint a speech and language therapist or speech pathologist for each educational zone in the country. The Ayati Centre is an initiative, which provides free treatment for children with special needs and it operates as a public-private partnership.

Here, the Minister emphasised the need to accelerate the launch of the passenger ferry service between the two countries, recognising its significance in providing greater convenience for low- income pilgrims from Sri Lanka who wish to visit Bodhgaya and other Buddhist religious sites in India. Furthermore, he expressed Sri Lanka’s continuous readiness to welcome passenger vessels adhering to international standards from any Indian port.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Minister said the country should get rid of departmental bureaucracy and go for a system that operates under a Board of Directors. “So that job security and the pension would remain.

The President was speaking at the ‘CVCD Excellence Awards’ ceremony as Chief Guest. The President highlighted the need to fix issues with the education system in this nation and added that conditions should be put in place so that everyone can complete their education at the appropriate age and move on. “The Government makes money available to fund students’ higher education. But then we find that another group of students equal to the number in the universities is going outside and paying money. So, is this the best way we have? We must preserve one right, which is in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: universal access to education. But different countries have different ways of doing it. Some give student loans; some help students who have economic issues but allow others to go ahead. So, are we to study? I think we have to study all these systems and then ensure the Government makes the funding available.” Look at the best system available for the maximum number to get their education. That’s the first item I think we have to go into if we can’t run away from the issue, because we will need a large number of engineers, a large number of doctors, and a large number of scientists. If we are to develop and go ahead, where are we going to get them? Who is going to educate them? That’s, I would say, the main issue we have,” the President said.

A report by Dell suggested that 85 per cent of jobs that will be around in 2030 do not exist yet. That means the next seven years are likely to bring about even more of an upheaval in the labour market, he pointed out and added, “General purpose technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) will continue to grow exponentially. Instead of getting anxious or trying to halt progress, which is a futile attempt, the new workforce will have to learn to work with them. AI should be thought of as IA—Intelligence Augmented. Used smartly, it has the potential to augment our productivity and creativity. This is, of course, easier said than done. Any change brings about a period of uncertainty and anxiety. While schools and universities may find it hard to keep their content and pedagogy up to date, they can play a huge role in helping learners find a supportive community, figure out how to learn new things, and continually reinvent themselves.” More than imparting knowledge, inculcating the right mindset toward work could be a more meaningful contribution of educational institutions. Thus, in countries like Sri Lanka where education is free for all from Primary to University, the perspectives of the welfare system may not hold for the future. We will have to consider education as an investment for which both the Government as well as the learners should share responsibility. Free education is at a crossroads, the minister said. Speaking further, the minister said education for the future must consciously pay attention to global issues of sustainability. In almost all areas of the UN declared sustainable goals, education can make a difference. “Sustainable Development Goal 4 is specifically about education where the need to provide greater access, quality and equity are matters of education policy. While we protect our human habitat, our responsibility is to ensure the sustainability of systems for the benefit of the new generation. My final point is about individual responsibility. As we know, future systems depend on responsible choices. The new knowledge and technologies emerging are enhancing the capacity of human beings beyond our imagination. Irresponsible use of new technologies, including AI, may destroy our future. Therefore, education must assume a greater role in developing the morality of individual persons,” the minister said."

The requirements for the systems were provided by the Department of Immigration and Emigration, and AASL funded the project as per a Cabinet directive. eGates allow arriving and departing passengers to clear border controls quickly and efficiently. The project is expected to ensure a smooth passenger flow, particularly at peak times, reduce costs, and improve passenger satisfaction. During the initial phase, two eGates will be installed at the Departure Terminal, and another two eGates will be installed at the Arrival Terminal within eight months. The principal manufacturer of these systems will be Thales DIS Singapore Pte. Ltd., which provides state-of-the-art solutions to customers in the aerospace, defence, security and transportation markets.

He was speaking at the Working Committee meeting of the Habaraduwa electoral division in the Galle District on 10 June. Abeywardena said a change must take place to move the country forward from the current situation to address economic and livelihood issues it is facing. He said the UNP had a history of making timely changes and was now looking to amend its constitution in line with the prevailing situation, thus the UNP plans to convene a party conference soon. Abeywardena pointed out that President J. R. Jayewardene was instrumental in amending the UNP’s constitution in 1978. One of the amendments included a clause stating that a UNP member who becomes the President of the country automatically becomes the leader of the party. However, the constitution of the country itself was amended in the same year in a way that contradicted the party’s constitution, resulting in the UNP losing power. Abeywardena clarified that the introduction of the preferential voting system was carried out by the late President R. Premadasa and not by former President Jayewardene. The amendment  will be initiated by UNP Leader President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who will set up a working committee in July this year. The amendment must follow the committee line, the Chairman said.. Abeywardena stressed that the country is on the brink of destruction and to rescue it from this tragic situation, amendments to the Constitution must be made, similar to the changes being made to the party constitution. President Wickremesinghe consistently emphasises the need for a stable national policy until 2048. By doing so, Sri Lanka ould become a powerful and developed nation in both the Asian continent and the rest of the world. Abeywardena said small nations such as the  Maldives and Israel have achieved their development goals because of stable national policies. Abeywardena added that there was no doubt that the country’s economy could be strengthened by next year. He urged against being influenced by certain elements that are taking advantage of the troubled waters and creating unnecessary problems. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

Sri Lanka’s unique Culinary Art has attracted tourists from many countries and maximum Government support will be extended to its promotion, the President said. The President was speaking at the opening of the Culinary Art Food Expo (CAFÉ) 2023 on 9 June at BMICH in Colombo. The Chefs Guild of Lanka organises the Culinary Art and Food Exhibition, which showcases the talent of culinary artists from all over Sri Lanka. This year’s exhibition consists of 88 product and service booths and the President joined in inspecting them. The President also engaged in a cordial discussion with the participating chefs and inquired about their well-being. The President said many new programmes will be implemented for the advancement of the field, including the setting up of a Culinary Art school and the introduction of a system for ranking chefs. Speaking further, President Wickremesinghe said, “The growth policy of the Government includes doubling tourism and in the first stage increasing the numbers to 5 million. Secondly, increase the revenue per tourist, which means we have to now attract high-end tourists. Some are worried that it is a difficult undertaking. I don’t think there is any option. A large number of human resources are leaving the country for greener pastures. We have at least got to match the Maldives in terms of remuneration. Otherwise, you can’t run a tourist industry. That can only be done if we are prepared to increase the rate thereby. But to do that we must provide a good service. There are many aspects; but remember, one that is common to all is cuisine. Tourists come here because they love our cuisine. As far as the suppliers are concerned, we would like you to maintain a high standard and up the bar, so that products can be exported eventually.” The President said he would like to see some of the private entrepreneurs coming forward. “You can’t develop the tourist industry without developing human resources. It is useless giving tax incentives to hotels if they haven’t got the manpower to run their kitchens. So the Government is willing to help and most probably in the next two months, announce our new policies and you will be surprised at what changes we are going to make. And similarly, your association and others involved in the tourist trade will get together I hope, to help us go forward,” he said."

Commenting on the impact Sri Lanka’s economic crisis has had on the airline, Nuttall explained that while they were initially faced with a challenge at the beginning of 2022, owing to the acute dollar shortage at the time, the airline recovered by around September that year. Further, he also said, even though several industries were affected by the devaluation of the rupee, SriLankan Airlines remained largely unaffected. “The currency devalued, that’s been a challenge for many people in the country. But actually, for the airline, it doesn’t really matter, because in practice 80 per cent of our revenue comes from overseas and actually even in the country the underlying fares are set in dollars. So, we are somewhat protected against currency moves,” he elaborated. Speaking on the restructuring of SriLankan Airlines and a solution for servicing its debts, Nuttall spoke of the potential privatisation of the national carrier owing to the Sri Lankan Government’s decision to no longer fund ‘loss-making’ State-owned Enterprises (SOEs), a decision Nuttall believed was taken to “absolve from liability.” He emphasised, however, that the airline has not received any funds from the Government for nearly two years, adding that almost 10 per cent of their revenue went towards paying “unsustainable” interest rates of between 12 per cent to 15 per cent on dollar debt that “had nothing to do with the airline.” When queried on the potential privatisation of the flag carrier and if any offers have been received so far, Nuttall said, he remains unaware of this move, as their involvement has not yet been sought in the matter. “We’re not managing it, the Government is managing it. But we expect, at some time in the process, that they will ask for Expressions of Interest (EOIs) and then we’ll see. Do we get a good partner that works? Maybe. Maybe not,” he said.

The flag carrier’s Chairman, Ashok Pathirage, speaking to journalists at the IATA AGM in Istanbul, Türkiye said the airline plans to ramp up frequencies across the network, as the first of 10 new leased aircraft join the fleet. It hopes to increase frequency to London, from nine weekly flights to twice daily, while services to India – the airline’s largest market  will be boosted from around 80 weekly flights at present to pre-pandemic frequencies of over 100. Pathirage also said, the airline aims to restore its network in Mainland China, where he acknowledged that initial demand recovery was “not what we had expected.” However, he noted that supply chain challenges including engine reliability issues could impact its recovery efforts. Much of the capacity ramp-up will come as it takes delivery of 10 leased aircraft in the next two to three months, Pathirage said. The Oneworld carrier secured leases for five Airbus A330s and A320s, to boost a fleet which had been cut amid ongoing restructuring efforts. “There are so many opportunities for us, but a reduced fleet size and engine issues have proved challenging,” Pathirage added. In April, the airline disclosed the grounding of five A320neo aircraft over a global engine shortage. SriLankan said the narrow-body aircraft, which are powered by CFM International Leap-1A turbofans, were “presently awaiting engines after shop visits as the global industry faces a shortage of engines and long lead times for engine repairs for this type of aircraft due to a technical reliability issue.” Pathirage said, the airline has grounded four aircraft as a result of the engine issues. He added that “he will continue to push the engine manufacturers” in meetings at the IATA AGM. “We are working very hard on the engine issues, and hopefully with the new aircraft deliveries… they will be able to meet our expectations,” he said.

This development comes after the Ministry explored various strategies to overcome the challenges posed by the foreign exchange crisis and to guarantee a continuous supply of fuel to consumers. The current economic situation has hindered the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) from importing fuel shipments as planned. Insufficient foreign exchange, at the time of opening Letters of Credit and settling bills, has exacerbated the issue. Consequently, the Ministry sought solutions to mitigate these challenges, leading to the invitation of Expression of Interests (EOIs) from reputable petroleum companies. Following a rigorous evaluation process, several companies were shortlisted and invited to submit detailed proposals. The Cabinet Appointed Special Committee (CASC) and the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) carefully scrutinised these proposals and recommended the awarding of contracts to M/s Sinopec Fuel Oil Lanka (Private) Limited, M/s United Petroleum Pty Ltd and M/s RM Parks in collaboration with Shell, subject to negotiations. After thorough consideration of the recommendations made by the CASC and the Committee appointed by the Cabinet, the Cabinet granted approval to award contracts to the selected suppliers. The contract agreement with M/s Sinopec Fuel Oil Lanka (Private) Limited and its parent companies was signed on 22 May   2023, following successful negotiations. RM Parks Inc., in collaboration with Shell, aims to commence operations in Sri Lanka within 45 days after the issuance of the licence. This agreement marks a significant milestone in ensuring a reliable and uninterrupted supply of fuel to meet the country’s energy needs amid challenging economic circumstances. The event was attended by Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabri, State Ministers D.V. Chanaka, Indika Anuruddha, Shehan Semasinghe, Presidential Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, American Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung, Secretaries of pertinent ministries, government officials, and various dignitaries."

According to the complaint, based on the information obtained through a Right to Information (RTI) request, during her tenure as the Mayor of Colombo from 2018 to 2023, Senanayake had accumulated a total electricity bill of Rs 9 million(Rs 9,043,553). The complaint also highlighted that a private company initially provided eight cleaning workers for her official residence and as of 16 February  2021, the number increased to nine workers, with a total payment of Rs 15.1 million (Rs 15,107,894). Additionally, the complaint mentioned that three employees from Viharamahadevi Park were engaged to clean the garden opposite the official residence, receiving a payment of Rs 909,000. “According to the proper procedures and practices of the Colombo Municipal Council, the Mayor’s official residence should have had a total of four employees assigned for cleaning duties. However, as per the complaint, three municipal employees and nine workers from a private company were employed, resulting in a total of 12 employees for the cleaning work,” they alleged. The RTI request revealed that the cleaning workers of the Mayor’s official residence were paid the following amounts: Rs 947,724 in 2018, Rs 4,199.499 in 2019, Rs 3,814.072 in 2020, Rs 4,608.708 in 2021, and Rs 1,537.890 in 2022. Furthermore, the Land Management and Environmental Development Unit confirmed that three workers were specifically assigned to clean the courtyard of the Mayor’s official residence. Their designated working hours were from 8.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. The UNP members have requested the Bribery Commission for an investigation to determine whether the former Mayor had committed corruption under Section 70 of Act No. 19 (Amended) of 1994, established by the Bribery Commission, through the misappropriation of State funds or providing unauthorised benefits to another party.

Recently, a programme was organised to honour and remember these innocent victims. In a unique and heartfelt tribute, a ceremony was held atop the very same garbage hill, that concealed the victims. This event marked the first time in history that such a worshipful gesture was conducted from a garbage dump, with participants standing 300 feet above the ground. Under the guidance of the Kolonnawa Divisional Secretariat, Local Government organisations, private entities, civil groups, and residents worked together to create a designated area called the Poson zone around the mountain. At the summit, a replica of Mihintale, a Buddha statue, and a shrine were erected. During the Poson week, many individuals climbed to the peak of the garbage dump. From there, they beheld the sprawling city of Colombo with their naked eyes, as well as the Kelani Valley on the opposite side. On the final day of the Poson programme, tributes were expressed for those who lost their lives beneath the mountain, following which, breakfast was offered to the Buddhist clergy in attendance. The programme was meticulously organised by Chaminda Paranamana, Assistant Divisional Secretary of Kolonnawa and led by Ven. Angunakolapalasse Vipulasiri Vitiyala Kavidhaja Thera and Ven.

The Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) hosted the event in collaboration with the IFRC. With the world having to face one of the largest public health emergencies (PHE) in decades, it is critical that the world work together to develop a more inclusive and resilient disease outbreak management system. At the launch event, IFRC Regional Director for Asia Pacific, Alexander Matheou commented, “In the context of the Asia Pacific, where six of the top ten most vulnerable countries in the world are prone to natural disasters, with a USD 50 billion economic cost in 2021. In the Red Cross, we strive to do this by engaging our local actors and partners to come up with solutions tailored to the communities’ context, something that is accessible, affordable, and works for everyone, especially for the most vulnerable.” This report focuses on preparedness: preparation for COVID-19 was insufficient, and the world must now better prepare for the next public health emergency. Being truly prepared entails being ready to prevent, respond to, and recover from an emergency and learning lessons for the next time. In other words, readiness is a continuous, ongoing process. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement strive to achieve this by engaging local actors and partners to develop solutions tailored to the communities’ context, solutions that are accessible, affordable, and work for everyone, particularly the most vulnerable. According to the findings of this report, communities must trust local providers for response efforts to be successful. Building trust in communities is critical because when people believe public health messages, they are more likely to comply with public health measures designed to slow disease spread and save lives. Similarly, millions of people could only be vaccinated in record time when most believed the vaccines were safe and effective. “This report is being launched as an important event in a series of events that take place in the coming two days. The leaders of South Asia are meeting in Colombo to discuss common challenges faced by the national societies in our region. All these challenges must be resolved, and the national societies in this region are part and parcel of the solution as they are auxiliaries to the governments in their respective countries in humanitarian activities”, added the SLRCS Director General, Dr. Mahesh Gunasekara. To avoid duplication with any other Covid-19 report, the report was created with as much evidence as possible and as broadly as possible. It covers the local community, emergency preparedness, and disaster law. It emphasises three elements that were not adequately emphasised during the Covid-19 pandemic: trust, equity, and local action. With six chapters and six essential actions and recommendations aimed at being prepared for a future global health emergency, all of which contribute to preparation: Strengthening prevention and preparedness at the local level (one-health approach), Leveraging the roles and capacities of communities and local actors through integrated community health systems, Building global solidarity mechanisms to ensure that pandemic response products reach all communities (sharing of scientific research, vaccine inequities, regional production, and distribution centre around the world), Protecting communities against the socioeconomic impacts of public health emergencies (women, undocumented migrants, expand and improve social security), Collecting local data and harnessing it to take action (collect more data at the local level/community feedback) and Strengthening legal preparedness for public health emergencies (Disaster Law, review of PHE laws and regulations, domestic legal preparedness). The panel invites you to join the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to discuss the World Disaster Report findings and think about how to work together to build a more inclusive and resilient disease outbreak management system. These discussions are critical for strengthening and improving health emergency and disaster risk management in future outbreaks. Bridging these gaps can reduce outbreak-related deaths, diseases, and psychosocial impacts on communities."

Jaishankar told reporters in New Delhi while commenting about the tableau in a parade. “I think it is not good for relationships, not good for Canada,” he said. Canada’s High Commissioner in India also condemned the incident at a parade by Sikh activists in the Canadian city of Brampton. Video circulated in recent days on the internet showed a tableau from the parade featuring Gandhi wearing a blood-stained white saree with her hands up as turban-clad men pointed guns at her. A poster behind the scene read: “Revenge”. “I am appalled by reports of an event in Canada that celebrated the assassination of late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,” Cameron MacKay said on Twitter. “There is no place in Canada for hate or for the glorification of violence. I categorically condemn these activities.” Several members of Gandhi’s Congress party condemned the holding of the parade in the Canadian city and demanded action from the Indian Government. “It’s not about taking sides, it’s about respect for a nation’s history and the pain caused by its Prime Minister’s assassination,” former Congress Mumbai leader Milind Deora wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry also condemned the act. Ali Sabry said on twitter, “This is totally unacceptable. In the name of freedom of expression and promoting diversity, no country could afford to grant sanctuaries to terrorists and secessionists. If you allow to glorify terrorism, you are misleading another generation of youth towards despair.” Gandhi was assassinated in 1984 by two Sikh bodyguards after she allowed the storming of the holiest Sikh temple, aimed at flushing out Sikh separatists who demanded an independent homeland to be known as Khalistan. The storming of the temple angered Sikhs around the world. The death toll in the attack remains disputed, with Indian authorities putting it in the hundreds and Sikh groups in the thousands. Canada has the highest population of Sikhs outside their home State of Punjab in India. Earlier this year, India summoned Canada’s High Commissioner to convey concern over pro-Khalistan protesters in Canada who breached the security of India’s diplomatic mission and consulates. Bilateral commercial relations between the two countries are worth USD 100 billion, which includes USD 70 billion of Canadian portfolio investment, according to official figures. (Al Jazeera)"

MCPA President, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa alleged that the Health Secretary had appointed procurement committees at his level and given the approval to buy these 450,000 insulin vials under emergency purchasing. The Ministry of Health has to pay Rs 270 million to buy this stock at a cost of Rs 600 each, he said. Quoting a letter from SPC, he alleged the tender process for this insulin stock is questionable. “No attempt has even been made to keep a bank guarantee to import the said vials. The letter also questions as to whether the stock of insulin was due to expire,” he alleged. “To pay for the purchase of this insulin or to import drugs that are about to expire is questionable according to instructions given by the Procurement Committee, especially when the country was receiving stocks of insulin that had been ordered earlier. In addition, SPC was also going to receive nearly 250,000 of the Medical Supply in days to come,” the MCPA President said.  He accused the Health Ministry of wasting a colossal amount of taxpayers’ money by continuing with emergency purchasing rather than adhering to the normal method of procuring medicinal drugs for State hospitals. Dr. Sanjeewa accused the Health Ministry of purposely failing to order the medicinal drugs in advance under the proper system. “The country loses a large amount of tax money as a result,” he said. While the MCPA has continued to highlight this fact, the Health Ministry officials have continued to carry out emergency drug purchases brazenly despite drawing the attention of even the Secretary to the President and the President himself. He said it was the responsibility of the President’s Secretary to probe the matter and work out whether there was any fraud taking place in the transactions being carried out. Dr. Sanjeewa said his outfit plans to present facts to the President’s Secretary within the next few days in this regard. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

ACEPA Secretary, Ratnasiri Alahakoon, when contacted yesterday (6) said, “It is unfortunate that the Ministry of Trade and the CAA were attempting to find answers to the country’s protein requirement by slapping regulatory prices on chicken and eggs while conveniently overlooking the skyrocketing prices of vegetables and fish and the present viral infection that has affected the cattle and swine trade.” With the temporary halt on the transportation of cattle and the sale of beef and pork due to the spread of viral infection, and the increasing cost of fish and vegetables, the CAA and the Trade Ministry should withdraw the gazette which slapped maximum retail prices on eggs and chicken and permit the egg and chicken producers with guidance from the Department of Animal Production and Health (DAPH) to decide on the prices. The ACEPA Secretary alleged that the importation of allegedly weak animals during the last few years had introduced these animal diseases to two more of the country’s farming industries. “This would be the plight of the country’s poultry industry if nothing is done to put a halt to the meddling by the Trade Ministry and the CAA,” he said. The CAA in April slapped MRP per egg according to which a white egg was to be sold at Rs 44 and a brown egg at Rs 46. Also, the price per kg of white eggs was stipulated at Rs 880 and a kilo of brown eggs at Rs 920. The cost of one kg of chicken was Rs 1,300.   He lamented that while transportation of cattle and the sale of meat, beef, and pork had been stopped, the prices of vegetables and fish had soared within the past few months which has also increased the demand for eggs and chicken. “But there has been no attempt made to import fish, beef, or pork on the pretext of finding solutions to the price issues or the transportation or sales being stopped,” he said.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/07/fao-to-support-health-ministry-to-enhance-sls-food-safety-policy/,FAO to support Health Ministry to enhance SL’s Food Safety Policy,Author not found,0,2023-06-06T20:30:00+00:00,"The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), through the European Union (EU)-funded BESPA-FOOD (Best Standardised Practices for the Agri-Food Sector) Project, will support the Government to establish a well-coordinated food safety system in the country. Through the 6.5 million Euro project, FAO will work closely with the Ministry of Health to implement institutional revisions in the country’s Food Safety Policy and regulatory framework towards adopting preventive, risk-based measures across the supply chain. The current food safety regulatory policies in Sri Lanka focus largely on end-product checks and regulations. Governed by a regulatory framework established in 1980, the challenges facing Sri Lanka’s food safety sector include, weak regulatory and institutional frameworks that have led to vulnerabilities in supply chains, and infrastructure as well as an approach that does not consider every aspect of the food supply chain from farm-to-table. To respond to these gaps, FAO will also work with the Ministries related to agriculture, livestock development and fisheries sectors, as well as other agri and food sector stakeholders, including private enterprises, SMEs, and consumers to achieve a complete transformation of food safety standards in the country via institutional as well as attitudinal shifts. “Food safety requires a collaborative effort. That is why in Sri Lanka we work together with the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), FAO and local partners to promote a transition to a sustainable and fair food system that can provide sufficient and safe food for all,” said Chargé d’affaires, Delegation of the European Union in Sri Lanka, Lars Bredal. “Ensuring safe food for all Sri Lankans is not only a public health priority but also an economic necessity. We must continue to strengthen our capacity for food safety, invest in research and innovation and prioritise consumer awareness and education. At FAO, we remain committed to working closely with our partners to achieve a food-secure and safe Sri Lanka,” said FAO Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Vimlendra Sharan. BESPA-FOOD, which is jointly implemented by FAO and UNIDO and funded by the EU, recognises that current levels of poor food safety standards not only impact public health but also hamper Sri Lanka’s potential in international trade, particularly when trading with regions where markets are highly regulated. Strengthening the food safety sector will not only alleviate the high cost of healthcare services but also create a resilient and competitive food industry in both domestic and international markets and combat the issue of food loss and waste, thereby contributing to overall food security in the country. A recent study by UNIDO revealed that an improvement in food safety practices in Sri Lanka through a USD 30 million investment and an annual net budgetary commitment of nine million could prevent at least 113 deaths annually and significantly boost annual export values, projected to increase by 24 per cent over a decade. On this World Food Safety Day, the EU, UNIDO and FAO reaffirm commitment to enhancing food safety in Sri Lanka through theBESPA-FOOD project. This collaborative effort aims to create a safer, more resilient, and economically vibrant food sector, ensuring thewell-being and sustainable development of the country and its people."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/06/governments-must-meet-their-biodiversity-pledges/,Governments must meet their biodiversity pledges,Author not found,0,2023-06-05T20:32:00+00:00," My work has taken me far and wide, across oceans and vast expanses of land, and I have been lucky enough to see firsthand some of the richest biodiversity hotspots on Earth. But at the end of the day, I always return home – to Liberia, to Africa, which offers the most extraordinary natural landscape and wildlife. The African continent is undoubtedly the planet’s biodiversity powerhouse. Writing about Africa’s natural capital doesn’t do it justice. How can one describe a quarter of global biodiversity – including at least 50,000 plant species, some 1,000 different mammals, 2,500 types of bird, and up to 5,500 varieties of freshwater fish – in a few words? It’s the same with Liberia: my country is home to large swaths of the Upper Guinean Forests, which is among the world’s foremost regions for mammalian diversity. It includes hundreds of thousands of hectares of freshwater wetlands and over six million hectares of forests, which are vital for the survival of endangered fauna and flora, as well as for local communities’ well-being. Given its abundance of natural capital, the continent stands to lose disproportionately from biodiversity collapse. When human activity pushes animal and plant species close to extinction and throws ecosystems out of balance, it also puts important valuable natural resources at risk: Africa’s diverse biomes play a crucial role in global pharmaceutical innovation, ecotourism, and crop pollination. Moreover, despite contributing only 3% to global greenhouse-gas emissions, Africa suffers disproportionately from the effects of a warming planet, losing up to USD 15 billion per year to climate change. Biodiversity loss exacerbates the problem by threatening the continent’s rainforests, an important carbon sink. And, given African economies’ dependence on natural resources and ecosystem services, it also impedes growth and development. That is why Africa has been at the forefront of biodiversity conservation efforts, and climate action more generally. The continent is increasingly calling attention to the issue and leading the charge at negotiations, most recently at December’s United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in Montreal. Several African States, including Liberia, have also held developed countries accountable for their existing commitments at these international summits. The talks at COP15 were ultimately successful, culminating in the adoption of the historic Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. One of its many ambitious targets is to protect 30 per cent of the world’s land and oceans by 2030. Also called ‘30×30’, it is a proposal that many in Liberia – including me, as a member of the Campaign for Nature’s Global Steering Committee – have long championed. Governments also committed to increase the annual biodiversity-related financing that developed countries provide to developing countries to at least USD 20 billion by 2025, and at least USD 30 billion by 2030. Six months after this landmark agreement, we need to maintain momentum and make good on these pledges. As the staggering decline in nature and wildlife continues unabated, now is not the time to falter. The theme of this year’s International Day for Biological Diversity (celebrated each year on 22 May), ‘From Agreement to Action: Build Back Biodiversity’, is a timely and powerful reminder of the urgent need to act quickly on the commitments made at COP15 and to shift our focus and energy from imagination to implementation. The recent G7 Summit in Hiroshima, where world leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Kunming-Montreal framework, was a welcome step in the right direction. But governments must deliver on their pledges to mobilise public finance if we want to achieve the ‘30×30’ goal of halting and reversing biodiversity loss. The funding will provide a lifeline for the world’s ecosystems and plant and animal species, as well as some of the world’s most vulnerable populations – particularly indigenous peoples and rural communities – whose livelihoods depend on their local natural capital. The global community has a history of breaking its word and shifting the goalposts agreed to in past climate and biodiversity deals. But the promise to increase international financing to developing countries must be kept. As global warming intensifies, we can no longer tolerate the repercussions of another deal like the one reached at the 2009 UN Climate Summit, which turned out to be mostly hot air. World leaders have an opportunity to be on the right side of history. But any delay in meeting the targets set at COP15 will undermine this landmark agreement. The resources are there. After rapidly mobilising trillions of dollars in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, developed countries should be able to move with the same speed to finance biodiversity conservation efforts. Their investments would yield significant dividends in developing countries, from supporting millions of jobs and generating billions of dollars in GDP to significantly reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. The moment has come for decision-makers at all levels in developed countries to deliver their end of the bargain. Let us not waste this last chance to preserve the planet’s natural wealth. If we can get this right, Africa – and the world – will be better for it. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a former president of Liberia, is a member of the Campaign for Nature’s Global Steering Committee.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/06/rs-40m-worth-automatic-dose-drawer-machine-idling/,Rs 40M worth ‘Automatic Dose Drawer’ machine idling,Author not found,0,2023-06-05T20:32:00+00:00," The Society of Government Radiology Technologists (SGRT) called for a formal investigation into the alleged misuse of public funds to purchase an ‘Automatic Dose Drawer,’ machine, for Apeksha Hospital, Maharagama, only to discard it due to the shortage of funds to purchase the Connector Tube for it to function. SGRT President, Chanaka Dharmawickrema said yesterday (5) that the piece of technology had been purchased along with the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scanner in 2018, at a cost of Rs 40 million through funds collected from the public. The PET scanner was purchased at a cost of Rs 200 million also using public funds and installed at Apeksha Hospital for patients with cancer at Maharagama. He said when tests were started that same year using the PET scanner, the hospital purchased an Automatic Dose Drawer machine for injecting the FDG (Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection) to patients, spending another Rs 40 million collected from the public. The machine, which was purchased at a cost of Rs 40 million, has been out of use for about 12 months now. The reason given was that there were no funds to purchase the Connector Tube to enable the use of this machine. He said that authorities had said, when purchasing Automatic Dose Drawer, that that purchasing it would help to reduce the number of Radiology Technologists engaged in administering the drug. However, with inability to function the Automatic Dose drawer, the Apeksha Cancer Hospital sought written advice from the Atomic Energy Regulatory Commission (AERC) on the manual use of the FDG drug. The Hospital had been informed that use of the diagnostic medication did not pose a serious threat of radiation being released, Dharmawickrema clarified. “What we now want to know is for whose need such a machine had been purchase spending Rs 40 million of public funds,” he said lashing out that the advice of the end user- the Radiology Technologist had not been sought at the time of the purchase of the automatic dose drawer. None of them were made a part of the Technical Evaluation Committee for the purchase of the relevant machine. It is evident that a large amount of people’s money was wasted by not involving the end user in the technical evaluation committees and not identifying the need. The SGRT President urged the Health Ministry and the Hospital authorities to refrain from attempting to save the face of those officials responsible for having purchased the Automatic Dose Drawer. Meanwhile, Director of Apeksha Hospital, Dr. A. Jayasekara, when contacted, said that it was about three months since the hospital ordered for the Connector tube for the Auto Dose Drawer which was going to cost over five million rupees. “Meanwhile, the AERC has reassured us that manually administering the radioactive medication to patients would not be harmful owing to the quantity being used. It is done in several other hospitals including National Hospital, Colombo,” Dr. Jayasejara added.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Opposition’s Executive Council, led by Prof. G.L. Peiris is committed to defeating the proposed legislation, which they believe aims at undermining the remaining democratic values in the country, Premadasa said. Premadasa emphasised the importance of an independent media as the fourth pillar of democracy and stressed that the proposed Bill would harm the free press. He called on both print and electronic media outlets to unite in opposing the Bill and to support the Opposition’s efforts. Premadasa also accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of attempting to exert undue influence on judicial officers, which he deemed inappropriate. He asserted that a free media serves as a crucial check and balance in the democratic system, alongside the legislature, executive, and judiciary. “The current Government is ready to destroy the free media through such Broadcasting Authority Bills and when the then government presented a similar Bill in 1997, on 5 May 1997, Judge A.R.B. Amarasinghe said that the Act is against the Constitution,” he alleged. Premadasa highlighted that the proposed Bill is unconstitutional and detrimental to democracy. He urged all media organisations to come together and defeat the Bill, emphasising the need to protect and uphold a free press. The Opposition stands firm in their determination to defeat the authoritarian and detrimental Broadcasting Authority Bill and is striving to safeguard the principles of a free media and democracy in the country, he said.

Pastor Fernando filed the FR Petition on 26 May requesting the Court to issue an order preventing his arrest by the CID, based on statements made by him affecting religious harmony. The Petitioner stated that the statement in question was made in order to bring out the differences contained in the Christian belief as opposed to the beliefs/practices in other religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. He noted that he did not advocate religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. The petitioner further noted that at the relevant sermon he stressed on the fact that love is a part of Christian teaching and while Jesus Christ said, “I am the light of the world” (vide Gospel of St. John. Chapter 8 verse 12), Lord Buddha means “the enlightened one” and submitted to the audience that when Lord Buddha was looking for light, he was actually looking for Jesus and that is why every Buddhist needs Jesus by using the words “So, I submit to you, the Buddha was looking for light; he was actually looking for Jesus. This is why every Buddhist needs Jesus.” He went onto state that approximately two weeks after delivering the aforesaid sermon, he left to Singapore, accompanied by his wife and two daughters on 19 May and to attend the Opening of ‘the Glorious Church’ in Singapore on 21 May 2023 and that the plans to attend the said events were made well ahead of the ceremony. The petitioner noted that if he is arrested upon his arrival in Sri Lanka, that would constitute a violation of Article 13(1) of the Constitution and sequel to his arrest, if he is held in custody or detained, that would constitute a violation of Article 13(2) of the Constitution and as such, there is an imminent danger of the infringement of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to him under Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution. Meanwhile, an intervening Petition was filed, before the Supreme Court on 1 June seeking the dismissal of the Fundamental Rights (FR) Petition filed by Pastor Jerome Fernando.

To achieve this, it is essential to  investigate Rajapaksa family. During a media briefing at his office in Kilinochchi, Sritharan expressed his disapproval of the threats made against Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, leader of the Tamil National People’s Front. He said any attempts to harm Ponnambalam or undermine him were unacceptable, considering that the oppression against minority communities in the country continues to persist in various forms. “While imposing taxes on citizens can be justifiable, MP Gajendrakumar criticised the Government for neglecting to provide facilities or concessions to students to obtain season tickets while attempting to tax them when they turn 18. Such actions were questionable. Further, no measures have been taken against the Rajapaksa family, particularly Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who are involved in corruption related to coconut oil imports and the coconut trade,” Sritharan said. He said an honest  government could not be expected as long as corrupt individuals continue to wield power and influence the country’s administration. BY Naalir Jamaldeen"

This was discussed at the committee meeting held under the Chairmanship of Jagath Kumara Sumithraarachchi. The discussion was held to review the role of important public institutions which are in direct contact with the public and which can address a large number of public concerns, needs and grievances and formulate a programme for guiding and monitoring them. Former Presidential Secretary Udaya Seneviratne, Former Ayurvedic Commissioner Dr. Gamini Kariyawasam, Former SDIG Sunil Edirisinghe, Industrial Development Board Chairman Dr. Saranga Alahapperuma, Former Secretary of the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training Sandhya Wijebandara, Former Ministry Secretary Siripala Wirithamulla, Former Immigration and Emigration Controller General Sarath Rupasiri and Former District Secretary Sunil Kannangara were involved in the discussion. There was a discussion at length about the actions to be followed to avoid the ineffectiveness of the government institutions and to eliminate the distance between the government institutions and the people. It was emphasised that it is more important to form an organisation by connecting local village leaders, Chief Incumbents of temples, other religious leaders, village workers, retired principals, and other local leaders and the Police to discuss and find solutions to local problems. Also, in 2019, the views on the ‘Gama Surakuma’ programme, implemented with Cabinet approval, were presented to the Committee and since it has become inactive, the Chair of the Committee asked the panel of experts to submit the proposal related to that programme to the Committee. In addition, the panel of experts pointed out that although there are rules and regulations related to administration, it is problematic that those rules and regulations are not implemented properly and it is important to maintain the process properly and monitor its operation in an active manner. Furthermore, it was discussed that the proper implementation and updating of systematic systems, designed for various processes related to government institutions, is important for the efficiency of government institutions as well as for the good relations between those institutions and the people. Furthermore, it was emphasised that the panel of experts further stated that the decentralisation of the functions and powers of the institutions has the ability to overcome the inconveniences caused to the people, and the establishment of a proper national policy for public institutions and their good functioning in practice is important for building an open and responsible government. MPs W. D. J. Seneviratne, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Mohomad Muzammil, Udayana Kirindigoda, Marjan Faleel, Mayantha Dissanayake and Rajika Wickramasinghe were present at the Committee meeting."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

According to AASL, this initiative aims to enhance the provision of ground handling services for international flight operations. “Ground handling plays a crucial role as the interface between the airport and airlines, ensuring smooth and efficient operations. AASL’s ground handling service at MRIA was inaugurated by catering to domestic airlines with incoming passengers. The dedicated ground handling staff successfully executed ground operations in compliance with international standards, meeting all regulatory requirements and providing comprehensive services. The team consists of experienced professionals who have undergone extensive training to deliver exceptional performance. AASL has recruited top talent and commenced training programmes to set up a fully-fledged ground handling services wing.” This strategic move by AASL will contribute to increasing the aeronautical revenue component and is well-timed considering the challenging and evolving business environment. Presently, AASL provides ground handling services at Colombo International Airport, Ratmalana (CIAR), and Jaffna International Airport (JIA) for domestic and international airlines. The expansion of ground handling services to Mattala and plans to extend them to Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) for international operations will further enhance AASL’s capabilities, the AASL said."

Ajahn Brahm Thera,Author not found,0,2023-06-04T20:32:00+00:00," Ven. Ajahn Brahmavamso Thera, who experienced a 12-hour delay at the BIA recently, said rather than focusing on his missed flight, Sri Lanka should prioritise fostering a better country with a culture of forgiveness. The Venerable Thera made this statement in a YouTube video published last Friday (2) by the Buddhist Society of Western Australia. He expressed his views on the situation, stating that a minor mistake was made, and it should not be blown out of proportion. He emphasised the importance of forgiveness and allowing people to make mistakes without fear, as it ultimately leads to fewer errors. The Thera also mentioned that he was unaware of the presence of the Sri Lankan Prime Minister at the lounge during the incident. Being a well-known monk, he was granted access to the VIP lounge. However, he clarified that he did not interact with the Prime Minister or engage in any activities that contributed to missing the flight. As per the Thera’s account, everything seemed orderly, and there was ample time to board the flight. When it was boarding time, he inquired about the process but was assured that everything was on schedule. Unfortunately, as he was escorted to the gate, he witnessed the boarding bridge disconnecting from the aircraft, signalling the plane’s departure. He missed his flight despite his best efforts. The Venerable Thera also commented on the need for VIPs to be cautious, as they can sometimes lose track of their responsibilities. He suggested that it would have been easier if he had simply walked to the gate without any special assistance. “I am a well-known monk. So, you go to the VIP lounge. I never knew the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka was at the lounge that evening. He was departing to some big event in Bangkok. Everything was orderly and there was plenty of time to board the flight. When it came to the boarding time, I asked if we are boarding soon. They said don’t worry, everything is on schedule. By the time they took me to the gate that is when I saw the boarding bridge was moving away from the aircraft. The plane took off. I missed my flight. Nothing to do with anything I was doing. I just saw the lounge. They are supposed to look after VIPs. Please never become a VIP. You tend to miss your flight. If I had just walked out by myself no problem, but you can’t exit, there are soldiers outside,” he said. The Venerable Thera said, “I learnt that the President has initiated an inquiry about how I missed my flight. Someone made a little mistake. It is not a big deal. So please instead of having an inquiry about how I missed my flight, have an inquiry about how you can have a better country with more forgiveness. Allow people to make mistakes because one thing I’ve noticed is when you allow people to make a mistake, they’re not afraid of making mistakes. They make fewer mistakes.” By Methmalie Dissanayake"

Public trust which has eroded regarding these institutions should be restored, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said. He was speaking at the recent National Law Conference. The President said, “The challenges also extend to our legal system, which faces numerous issues, including a backlog of thousands of cases that raises questions about the concept of justice. The media, too, is being questioned for its functioning, leading to a loss of credibility. Similarly, the private sector and other institutions face a loss of confidence. Our primary task is to regain that trust, as it is the first issue we must address. Failing to do so could lead us into a major crisis, and we must learn from the experiences of other countries where the internet has disrupted established institutions such as politics, courts, and media. Today, individuals can disrupt entire systems from the comfort of their homes with just a computer and a smartphone. This poses a significant challenge to conventional governance systems and their relationship with the people.” Amidst discussions on law and the economy, the President acknowledged the availability of diverse entertainment and points of interest for attendees. The President then shifted the attention to crucial events that unfolded ten to eleven months ago, which could have pushed the country to failure. Presently, Sri Lanka has restored law and order, political and economic stability. However, the President said these achievements were temporary and that significant challenges lie ahead. While refraining from delving into political issues, the President underscored the urgency of transforming the economy to avoid serious trouble. It was noted that Sri Lanka’s economy is still in a fragile state, with a need for debt restructuring and a focus on long-term growth. “First and foremost, we must acknowledge that what we have achieved so far is temporary, and there is still a long way to go in overcoming the challenges we face. This crisis is unlike any we have experienced before in Sri Lanka. While we have witnessed uprisings and wars in the past, the entire system was never so thoroughly challenged as it was in Colombo. Although we have restored law and order, political stability, and economic stability, we have not yet fully resolved the breach of trust between the majority of our people and the state operators, including the parliament, government, judiciary, media, private sector, trade unions, and professions. This is a critical aspect that we need to address,” he said. “Looking at the current political situation, it is unprecedented to have a President with only one MP, working alongside a parliament that includes crossbenchers. However, what concerns me is the lack of political parties with stable political structures. This situation poses a danger. Further, even though there may be disagreement among Members of Parliament, the combined support of all political parties in Sri Lanka does not exceed 50% of the voter base. Considering our highly politicized country, this number could have been as high as 70%, leaving only 10% to decide our fate,” he pointed out. “The breakdown of our economy does not surprise me; it was an inevitable outcome. When I assumed office in 2001, our economy was in a precarious state, on the verge of collapse. We secured the necessary funding and had USD 4 billion from the Tokyo conference, but we couldn’t utilize it due to our inability to make the required changes. The tsunami brought temporary relief by injecting dollars into Sri Lanka, sustaining us for a few years. However, we are now facing a revenue shortage. The government is not generating sufficient income, and our situation has reached a critical point.” Speaking further, the President said Sri Lanka needs a radical change and must depart from our partially open and partially controlled economy. We must determine our direction and meet the expectations of the people who desire high growth and a decent living standard that we have thus far been unable to provide, he said. “Unlike the 1980s or the early 2000s when the world was experiencing growth, we are now witnessing economic warfare amid the rivalry between the US and China. It is imperative that we protect ourselves from the repercussions of this rivalry. Therefore, we must assess our current situation and plan accordingly. Our economy must provide social protection and support the poor, with a long-term goal of lifting them out of poverty within the next 20 years. We need a social market economy that acknowledges the need to mitigate climate change and embraces a green economy. Additionally, we must adapt to the digital age and foster a digital economy. These are the foundations of the economic changes we seek to implement. To achieve these results, we must be proactive and not simply criticise others or remain complacent,” he concluded."

The EC has emphasised that the coordination of Local Government bodies can be done through municipal commissioners or the divisional secretary of the respective Local Government body. Therefore, the commission asserted that there is no need to appoint an additional representative for this purpose. The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) recently filed a petition in Supreme Court, challenging the decision to appoint special representatives for Local Government institutions. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/05/we-have-to-move-towards-paradigm-shift-president/,We have to move towards paradigm shift – President,Author not found,0,2023-06-04T20:32:00+00:00,"Sri Lanka needs to learn from other countries how internet has disrupted established institutions such as politics, courts, and the media. Public trust which has eroded regarding these institutions should be restored, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said. He was speaking at the recent National Law Conference. The President said, “The challenges also extend to our legal system, which faces numerous issues, including a backlog of thousands of cases that raises questions about the concept of justice. The media, too, is being questioned for its functioning, leading to a loss of credibility. Similarly, the private sector and other institutions face a loss of confidence. Our primary task is to regain that trust, as it is the first issue we must address. Failing to do so could lead us into a major crisis, and we must learn from the experiences of other countries where the internet has disrupted established institutions such as politics, courts, and media. Today, individuals can disrupt entire systems from the comfort of their homes with just a computer and a smartphone. This poses a significant challenge to conventional governance systems and their relationship with the people.” Amidst discussions on law and the economy, the President acknowledged the availability of diverse entertainment and points of interest for attendees. The President then shifted the attention to crucial events that unfolded ten to eleven months ago, which could have pushed the country to failure. Presently, Sri Lanka has restored law and order, political and economic stability. However, the President said these achievements were temporary and that significant challenges lie ahead. While refraining from delving into political issues, the President underscored the urgency of transforming the economy to avoid serious trouble. It was noted that Sri Lanka’s economy is still in a fragile state, with a need for debt restructuring and a focus on long-term growth. “First and foremost, we must acknowledge that what we have achieved so far is temporary, and there is still a long way to go in overcoming the challenges we face. This crisis is unlike any we have experienced before in Sri Lanka. While we have witnessed uprisings and wars in the past, the entire system was never so thoroughly challenged as it was in Colombo. Although we have restored law and order, political stability, and economic stability, we have not yet fully resolved the breach of trust between the majority of our people and the state operators, including the parliament, government, judiciary, media, private sector, trade unions, and professions. This is a critical aspect that we need to address,” he said. “Looking at the current political situation, it is unprecedented to have a President with only one MP, working alongside a parliament that includes crossbenchers. However, what concerns me is the lack of political parties with stable political structures. This situation poses a danger. Further, even though there may be disagreement among Members of Parliament, the combined support of all political parties in Sri Lanka does not exceed 50% of the voter base. Considering our highly politicized country, this number could have been as high as 70%, leaving only 10% to decide our fate,” he pointed out. “The breakdown of our economy does not surprise me; it was an inevitable outcome. When I assumed office in 2001, our economy was in a precarious state, on the verge of collapse. We secured the necessary funding and had USD 4 billion from the Tokyo conference, but we couldn’t utilize it due to our inability to make the required changes. The tsunami brought temporary relief by injecting dollars into Sri Lanka, sustaining us for a few years. However, we are now facing a revenue shortage. The government is not generating sufficient income, and our situation has reached a critical point.” Speaking further, the President said Sri Lanka needs a radical change and must depart from our partially open and partially controlled economy. We must determine our direction and meet the expectations of the people who desire high growth and a decent living standard that we have thus far been unable to provide, he said. “Unlike the 1980s or the early 2000s when the world was experiencing growth, we are now witnessing economic warfare amid the rivalry between the US and China. It is imperative that we protect ourselves from the repercussions of this rivalry. Therefore, we must assess our current situation and plan accordingly. Our economy must provide social protection and support the poor, with a long-term goal of lifting them out of poverty within the next 20 years. We need a social market economy that acknowledges the need to mitigate climate change and embraces a green economy. Additionally, we must adapt to the digital age and foster a digital economy. These are the foundations of the economic changes we seek to implement. To achieve these results, we must be proactive and not simply criticise others or remain complacent,” he concluded."

Sri Lanka is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, consistently ranking among the top ten nations at risk of extreme weather according to the Global Climate Risk Index. These climate impacts have had severe consequences on various economic sectors, affecting people’s lives and livelihoods. The signing of the Green Climate Fund Readiness project document marks an important milestone in Sri Lanka’s efforts to adapt and mitigate the impacts of climate change. The proposal aims to enhance the technical capacity of the Ministry of Environment and its partners, including the private sector. By working together, the project will help identify and implement the necessary measures to address climate challenges in priority sectors. The project also aims to attract public and private investments to promote climate-smart agriculture through scientific planning. Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Environment, expressed his commitment to building a sustainable future for Sri Lanka and contributing to the global fight against climate change. He said, “Together, we can adapt to the effects of climate change and secure a better future for our country. We will work hand in hand with FAO and other key stakeholders to ensure Sri Lanka’s climate resilience.” Vimlendra Sharan, FAO’s Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, highlighted the importance of climate-smart agriculture. “To become a food-secure nation and adapt to climate change, Sri Lanka must embrace climate-smart agriculture. FAO is committed to supporting the government in bridging the current gap between climate policies and action,” he said commenting on the partnership. The collaboration underscores the commitment of FAO and the Ministry of Environment to safeguarding the environment and building a sustainable future to create positive change and ensure a greener, more resilient Sri Lanka for generations to come."

Jude Crishantha Fernando said. Fr. Fernando speaking to Ceylon Today said that recent slanders and accusations levelled against the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka would not affect it in the least. The Catholic Church has been criticised throughout history. Quoting the New Testament of the Bible, he said that evil power was there in society and the world. “Even today we can see the threats, attacks and criticism to weaken the Church. The first golden era of the Church was destroyed by Roman Emperor Nero. But the Church developed rapidly at that time. The more we get outside threats the more we gained strength,” he said.  Fr. Fernando alleged that jealousy with regard to the support the Sri Lankan Catholic Church had received during the commemorative ceremonies held in mid-April, for the victims of the 2019 Easter attacks, would have also played a part in the criticism the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka was currently facing. “But we always have the faith that no one could weaken the Church,” he said. Fielding questions regarding why the Church made no attempt to clarify the misplaced public belief that the Catholic Church was responsible for all the conversions that were taking place, the National Director for Mass Communication said that parishioners were made aware of this fact during Holy mass and Church meetings. “We do not meet our brethren belonging to other faiths. But Catholic Priests meet with their parishioners who are made aware of the unjust manner in which these conversions are carried out, he noted. “The Catholics know the difference between the main line churches such as the Baptist, Methodist and Anglican churches with which we have a good rapport,” he said. Lashing out he said that Fundamentalist Churches (Bible Churches) were those who engaged in such unnecessary nonsense. Their main aim is to have a big crowd. They believe that it is only then that their religion will get developed in the world. These groups do favours, help people in kind and money and then convert them to their religion. If there are provisions in the law against such action where poverty and ignorance of people are made use of, the Government has the duty to take action. It should be more vigilant and take action against such incidences, he added. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Premadasa expressed his concerns regarding the proposed Broadcasting Authority legislation, describing it as another government project aimed at undermining democracy through the implementation of anti-democratic measures. He criticised the government’s plan to establish a Broadcasting Regulatory Commission, which he believed would suppress the media and undermine the country’s democracy. Under the proposed Act, television channels would be granted licences valid for only six months, followed by an annual licensing process. Premadasa pointed out that the licensing procedure would involve investigating whether the media organisations were pro-government or not. He warned that this could lead to severe media repression and a violation of democracy in the country. Premadasa further emphasised that the Act would regulate the media, creating channels that would only broadcast approved news, thus restricting the freedom and independence of the media. He stated that as the Opposition, they would unite against these suppressive measures and seek legal recourse to combat them.

According to LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne, the association requested a 50 per cent subsidy from the UNDP and pledged to provide the remaining payment for the buses. He said, “We had initially planned this eco-friendly project in 2017, but it was halted halfway. However, now it is back on track. The expenses associated with it are high and we are unable to invest solely on our own. Hence, we have requested a loan assistance to support this project.” Wijeratne explained that the LPBOA proposed an eight-year loan plan with a private bank, whereby they would only need to pay 50 per cent of the total amount as an investment. He said the low-floor electric buses would not be suitable for hilly areas and regions prone to frequent flooding. Additionally, these buses would be equipped with a digital ticketing system. The discussion with the UNDP proved fruitful, and Wijeratne expressed gratitude for their assurance of full support in expediting the implementation of this service. “We plan to initially launch the bus service in Colombo, its suburbs, and Jaffna town, taking into consideration the geographical factors of these areas,” he added.

The President reiterated his commitment to prevent any regression of the country to its previous state, emphasising his determination to transform Sri Lanka into a fully-developed nation by 2048. The President made these remarks during a special statement, to the nation yesterday (1), on presenting the ‘National Transformation Roadmap’ to the country. He said, in the last quarter of this year, “we will then work to unveil the national transformation plan to the public.” The President explained at length the measures taken by the government in the past nine months to assist the Sri Lankan economy to recover, as well as the next stages in the State’s social, economic and political reform agenda. He said, entities like the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Ceylon Electricity Board, and SriLankan Air Lines have incurred significant operating losses, equivalent to 1.6% of the country’s GDP in 2021. “We have already initiated the preparation of a restructuring plan for public enterprises. Additionally, we expect the chief officers of these enterprises to be committed to improving their performances. If they fail to meet the annual targets assigned to them, we will not hesitate to replace them with more suitable candidates,” he asserted. The President also presented the operational proposal to the country to achieve the desired goals. The country’s development has been based on four primary pillars: fiscal and financial reforms, investment drive, social protection and governance, and State-owned enterprises transformation, he said. “They are spreading false information about our reform agenda and intentionally misleading the public with claims that we are selling off the country. Throughout history, these groups have continuously resorted to fear-mongering tactics, falsely asserting that our actions are driven by a desire to sell out our nation. They have deceived many Sri Lankans in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and even the 1980s, instilling an irrational fear of the country being sold away. From then until now, these groups have disrupted real progress for economic reform by perpetuating this slogan of “selling the country,” he said. In the first quarter of this year, the remittances sent by foreign workers increased by 80.6% compared to 2022. Furthermore, our new tax policies have resulted in an additional income of Rs 210 billion in the first quarter of 2023, he said. The President said, the Government will halt unnecessary expenditure and streamline Government activities to reduce costs, design cost-effective government operations and leverage automation and digitalisation to reduce costs, while delivering quality services. “We aim to prioritise modern and sustainable efforts such as renewable energy, green hydrogen, and digitisation. We can draw inspiration from the Andhra region of India, which has excelled in developing these areas. Such modern and sustainable initiatives are vital for the complete transformation of Sri Lanka’s economy.

Dharmasekera noted that the AITWDU wants to regulate the fares, the government and its officials do not want that, he added.  “Even though the price of petrol was reduced, the prices of spare parts, lubricants, service and other accessories have not come down. While considering all aspects and the fuel waste per kilometre, only Rs 1 can be reduced from the current three-wheeler taxi fare,” Dharmasekera added.  He claimed that the petrol currently available in the country is not up to the quality standard and has affected the maximum distance a three-wheeler can run.

The minister’s statement came following long queues seen at fuel stations yesterday (1)in several areas of the country. He said both the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (Ceypetco) and Lanka IOC possess sufficient fuel stocks. Taking to Twitter, the minister clarified that any existing shortages were primarily caused by fuel station owners’ failure to place orders, as they were anticipating a decrease in fuel prices. He emphasised that all dealers were mandated to maintain a minimum stock level of 50 per cent. To ensure compliance, he instructed the CPC to thoroughly assess and suspend the licenses of any fuel stations found to be in violation, he said.

This was revealed by the Parliament watchdog, the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE). COPE met recently to review the Progress of implementing the directives issued to the SJGH, at the committee meeting held on 6 December 2022. The Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital (SJGH) is a Government owned, not for profit tertiary care institute, which was gifted by the people of Japan, honouring the late President J.R. Jayewardene. Established under the provision of Parliament Act No. 54 of 1983 it has been managed by a board of members since its inception on 17 September 1984. The meeting commenced with COPE Chairman Prof. Ranjith Bandara being extremely critical of the fact that despite repeated requests for a corporate plan to be submitted, there was still no officially submitted plan. On the investigation of the committee, the meeting took a deeper turn into the very nature of the model of the hospital. It seemed that between the Board and the Ministry officials, no one had a clear idea of what model the hospital was aspiring to adopt. The Chairman queried the lack of a business unit, a Human Resource Department, A Marketing or Business Development Department. The COPE Chairman repeatedly queried the Board if it was a government hospital, a profit-making public enterprise, or a hybrid of the two. Following much scrutiny, the Hospital Board admitted that it had yet to be ascertained in consultation with all stakeholders present. Further, there was widespread confusion with regards to the recruitment process, as the Managerial Services Department had not been consulted or informed of supposed recruitments that had taken place by the Board. At the very least there was no official Statement of Requirement (SOR) to justify the recruitment, which was a clear violation of the Act which governs the hospital. The Hospital Board was instructed to re-appear before COPE on 20 June to submit the action plan. Further, COPE appointed sub-committee would summon the Board to discuss the land issue of the hospital and the non-issuance of the requested reports. The committee advised the Hospital Director to get his house in order and urgently prioritise the need for vision and a proper corporate direction. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

The President reiterated his commitment to prevent any regression of the country to its previous state, emphasising his determination to transform Sri Lanka into a fully-developed nation by 2048. The President made these remarks during a special statement, to the nation yesterday (1), on presenting the ‘National Transformation Roadmap’ to the country. He said, in the last quarter of this year, “we will then work to unveil the national transformation plan to the public.” The President explained at length the measures taken by the government in the past nine months to assist the Sri Lankan economy to recover, as well as the next stages in the State’s social, economic and political reform agenda. He said, entities like the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Ceylon Electricity Board, and SriLankan Air Lines have incurred significant operating losses, equivalent to 1.6% of the country’s GDP in 2021. “We have already initiated the preparation of a restructuring plan for public enterprises. Additionally, we expect the chief officers of these enterprises to be committed to improving their performances. If they fail to meet the annual targets assigned to them, we will not hesitate to replace them with more suitable candidates,” he asserted. The President also presented the operational proposal to the country to achieve the desired goals. The country’s development has been based on four primary pillars: fiscal and financial reforms, investment drive, social protection and governance, and State-owned enterprises transformation, he said. “They are spreading false information about our reform agenda and intentionally misleading the public with claims that we are selling off the country. Throughout history, these groups have continuously resorted to fear-mongering tactics, falsely asserting that our actions are driven by a desire to sell out our nation. They have deceived many Sri Lankans in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and even the 1980s, instilling an irrational fear of the country being sold away. From then until now, these groups have disrupted real progress for economic reform by perpetuating this slogan of “selling the country,” he said. In the first quarter of this year, the remittances sent by foreign workers increased by 80.6% compared to 2022. Furthermore, our new tax policies have resulted in an additional income of Rs 210 billion in the first quarter of 2023, he said. The President said, the Government will halt unnecessary expenditure and streamline Government activities to reduce costs, design cost-effective government operations and leverage automation and digitalisation to reduce costs, while delivering quality services. “We aim to prioritise modern and sustainable efforts such as renewable energy, green hydrogen, and digitisation. We can draw inspiration from the Andhra region of India, which has excelled in developing these areas. Such modern and sustainable initiatives are vital for the complete transformation of Sri Lanka’s economy. Over the next few months, we will extend a special invitation to the private sector to submit their own business proposals that align with our vision of modernisation and sustainability. We will ensure transparency and openness by publicising this call for proposals through mass media in a formal manner. We believe that a collaborative partnership between the public and private sectors will drive the engine to accelerate Sri Lanka’s economic growth and revival.” The selection of proposals is based on four key criteria that are: size of private investment, job creation, export contribution, and economic contribution. Under the Lab approach, we will bring together Government Ministers, Government officials, subject matter experts, and key representatives from the private sector to collaboratively engage in detailed discussions over a period of six weeks.

The visit was to attend the United Nations Vesak Day celebrations and discuss the strengthening of bilateral relations between the two countries and to strengthen trade and investment and religious ties. Sri Lanka and Thailand have a strong cultural and religious bond because of their shared Buddhist heritage. The Siam Nikaya, which originated in Thailand, is one of the most revered monastic orders in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is Thailand’s fourth-largest trade partner in South Asia, behind India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Sri Lanka’s main exports to Thailand include gems, jewellery, tea, spices, fibre and metal products. Thailand, meanwhile, exports used cars, sugar, textiles, dry fish, cement, chemical products and car and automotive parts to Sri Lanka. The Thai Prime Minister suggested that the countries could encourage cooperation by leveraging their different comparative advantages. He said Colombo Port City is a great opportunity for all the countries in Asia and many Thai entrepreneurs will invest in Port City. He opined that Thailand is well placed to polish and cut gemstones from Sri Lanka, as well as market them. This division of labour would also help to reduce direct competition in the global market for both countries. Sri Lanka and Thailand belong to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), a body that promotes free trade among its members. Prime Minister Gunawardena briefed the Thai Prime Minister about the plans implemented by the Government to overcome the economic crisis and revive economic activities.

At a ceremony on 30 May, the Australian Federal Police gifted the Sri Lankan Police a Toyota HiAce that will be utilised to travel throughout Sri Lanka to support the Sri Lanka Police, Human Trafficking, Smuggling and Maritime Division, CID. The vehicle will be used in a wide range of activities relating to transnational crime investigations and to counter maritime people smuggling. Australian Federal Police Senior Officer, Robert Wilson said, “Australia highly values the cooperation of our international law enforcement partners, in particular the Sri Lanka Police, in combating transnational crime.” “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Sri Lanka Police for their continued efforts to deter and disrupt illegal maritime people smuggling activities in Sri Lanka,” Senior Officer Wilson said. “Working together, Australia and Sri Lanka send a strong message that people smugglers and potential illegal immigrants considering illegal travel to Australia by boat have zero chance of success.” “The vehicle will provide a strong capability boost to help identify people smuggling ventures throughout Sri Lanka,” SO Wilson said. The threat of maritime people smuggling is ever present as people smugglers find different ways to exploit vulnerable people.

Congratulating fellow citizens on the occasion, the Indian Prime Minister remarked that the day of 28 May was an immortal signature on the face of time. “People of India have given themselves a gift for the Amrit Mahotsav”, he said. The new Parliament was the need of the hour given the difficulties faced by the Parliamentarians in getting work done in the old Parliament building due to the lack of technical facilities and paucity of seats in the House. The new building blends the ancient and the modern, with the interiors of Lok Sabha (House of the People) themed on the National Bird Peacock and Rajya Sabha (Council of States) on the National Flower Lotus. Parliament premises also has the National Tree Banyan. In the Prime Minister’s words, the building “has Virasat (Heritage) as well as Vastu (Architecture), Kala (Art) as well as Kaushal (Skill), Sanskriti (Culture) as well as notes of Samvidhan (Constitution)”. The new building embodies the spirit of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat having incorporated specialities of different parts of the country, for instance, granite from Rajasthan, timber from Maharashtra and carpets by Bhadohi artisans. The New Parliament House also has a gallery dedicated to the 60,000 labourers who were employed for its construction. The Indian Prime Minister, in his remarks on the occasion, said this is not merely a building, but reflects the aspirations and dreams of 1.4 billion Indians. “This is a temple of our democracy that gives a message of India’s resolution to the world”, he said. He continued, “This new Parliament building connects planning to reality, policy to realisation, willpower to execution, and Sankalp (resolve) to siddhi (realisation)”. “New models can be established only by treading new paths”, Modi remarked as he highlighted that New India is realising new goals and paving new ways. “There is a new energy, new zeal, new enthusiasm, new thinking and a new journey. There are new visions, new directions, new resolutions and a new trust”, Prime Minister Modi exclaimed. Prime Minister said that the world is looking towards India’s determination, its citizens’ vigour and the strength of human resources in India with respect and hope. “When India moves forward, the world moves forward”, he remarked. Parliament being the temple of democracy, the Indian Prime Minister on the occasion said, “India is not only a democratic nation but also the mother of democracy”. He underlined that democracy is not just a system that is practised in India but it is a culture, thought and tradition. The Indian Premier said after years of slavery, India resumed its journey and has now reached the Amrit Kaal, that is, the period of 25 years to India’s 100th year of Independence. “Amrit Kaal is a period of forging new dimensions of development while preserving our heritage. This is Amrit Kaal of giving a new direction to the nation.” The Indian PM said the new Parliament Building will strengthen the nation’s belief in its success and will inspire everyone towards a Viksit Bharat. “We will have to move with a spirit of – Nation First.  We will have to keep the path of duty above all. We will have to be an example with our conduct while constantly improving ourselves. We will have to tread our own path”, he said. Stressing the importance of the Parliament, Modi said it is the resolution of 1.4 billion Indians that consecrates the Parliament. He expressed the hope that every decision taken here will adorn the coming centuries and empower the coming generations. Prime Minister underlined that the path of empowerment of the poor, dalit, backward, tribal, disabled, and every deprived family of the society, along with prioritising the development of the deprived will pass through this Parliament.

The meeting took place at the Government House in Bangkok during the three-day visit of Prime Minister Gunawardena to Thailand. The visit was to attend the United Nations Vesak Day celebrations and discuss the strengthening of bilateral relations between the two countries and to strengthen trade and investment and religious ties. Sri Lanka and Thailand have a strong cultural and religious bond because of their shared Buddhist heritage. The Siam Nikaya, which originated in Thailand, is one of the most revered monastic orders in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is Thailand’s fourth-largest trade partner in South Asia, behind India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Sri Lanka’s main exports to Thailand include gems, jewellery, tea, spices, fibre and metal products. Thailand, meanwhile, exports used cars, sugar, textiles, dry fish, cement, chemical products and car and automotive parts to Sri Lanka. The Thai Prime Minister suggested that the countries could encourage cooperation by leveraging their different comparative advantages. He said Colombo Port City is a great opportunity for all the countries in Asia and many Thai entrepreneurs will invest in Port City. He opined that Thailand is well placed to polish and cut gemstones from Sri Lanka, as well as market them. This division of labour would also help to reduce direct competition in the global market for both countries. Sri Lanka and Thailand belong to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), a body that promotes free trade among its members. Prime Minister Gunawardena briefed the Thai Prime Minister about the plans implemented by the Government to overcome the economic crisis and revive economic activities. He also stressed the Government plans to have close economic cooperation with ASEAN member countries. Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai recalled his meetings with Prime Minister Gunawardena and assured Sri Lanka of fullest support at international fora.

Therefore a group staged a protest in front of the hospital premises yesterday (1), demanding that the hospital be provided with necessary facilities. This hospital, which is more than 75 years old was established by the former Prime Minister S. W.R. D. Bandaranaike and a former health Minister Siva Obeysekera. It provides services to approximately 6,000 families in the area. The protesters alleged the pharmacist who was working on contract basis left the hospital without wages and since then, more than a month now, no pharmacist has bee provided. Chief Medical Officer of the hospital H.R. W. Wickramasinghe said 300 patients and 500 clinical patients visit the hospital daily. She also mentioned that the existing problem has been reported to the authorities. She says, even if someone is brought from a nearby hospital, providing medicines to the clinical patients is also a problem because the hospital does not have a pharmacist. Meanwhile, other necessary staff and facilities are also lacking in the hospital. The hospital garage has been taken over by hospital staffs and drivers. Due to lack of space a doctor has taken a room where pregnant women are examined. They say that the mortuary has run wild due to lack of minor workers and the bodies are being sent to the Gampola Hospital.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/01/certain-degree-of-discretion-must-be-awarded-to-police-sc/,Certain degree of discretion must be awarded to Police – SC,Author not found,0,2023-05-31T20:32:00+00:00," The Supreme Court on Tuesday (30) said the discretion granted to Police to arrest based on ‘reasonable suspicion to arrest’, should not extend to the extent where it would amount to an arbitrary violation of liberty and should be strictly carried out where reasonable grounds for such arrest exist. Court held that a certain degree of discretion must necessarily be awarded to the Police for the due performance of their duties and maintenance of public order, noting however that, allowing the police to arrest on suspicion where it is not reasonable would create room for violations of liberty to take place. This was when the Fundamental Rights Petition filed by two individuals working for a business engaged in exporting sea food, meat, vegetables and bakery products in bulk was taken before Supreme Court Justices Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC, A. L. Shiran Gooneratne and K. Priyantha Fernando. The Petitioners stated that when they were on their way to Negombo on a poya day in September 2016 transporting mutton, the lorry was stopped in Maha Weva by the respondent who is a Police Sergeant and some other Police Officers. The Police Officers asked them to show the permit to transport meat. The petitioners stated that, they have often been transporting meat and such permit was never required. The Petitioners were then arrested while the vehicle containing mutton was seized. The petitioners state that they were not informed of the reason for such arrest. On behalf of the respondents, it was submitted that, the petitioners were arrested while transporting a huge quantity of meat during the wee hours of a Poya day. It was the contention of the Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) that under the circumstances, a reasonable suspicion arose that animals have been slaughtered for sale on a Poya day.  It was further submitted that, the petitioners were charged under the provisions of the Food Act for the possession and transportation of mutton which is unsuitable for human consumption, as per the report of the Veterinary Research Institute of Gannoruwa. “Upon being questioned whether there was a permit to transport meat, the petitioners have asserted that it was never a requirement to carry a permit when transporting meat. However, they have produced the receipt in proof of purchasing the meat and the certificate issued by the PHI of Mihintale to the respondents. This cannot be considered as falling within the purview of an ‘arrest based on reasonable suspicion’ simply due to the fact that, there was no basis for such a reasonable suspicion to arise. The petitioners were not butchers, they were employees of a wholesale transport service,’’ Court held. It was further held that the petitioners were arrested on mere speculation, without any basis for reasonable suspicion. ‘’The respondents arrested the petitioners without reasonable grounds on vague suspicion, intending to obtain evidence after the arrest. Further, malice on the part of the respondents also contributes to conclude that this course of action is strictly outside the authority afforded to police officers and therefore is a direct violation of Article 13(1) of the Constitution,’’ Court held. It was also held that the arbitrariness of the arrest made without legal basis affects the equal protection guaranteed to the petitioners under section 12(1) of the Constitution as well. Thereby Court ordered the first respondent to pay a sum of Rs 25,000 as compensation to each of the petitioners and the second respondent to pay Rs 10,000 as compensation to each of the petitioners out of their personal funds.

The Committee was chaired by Lasantha Alagiyawanna. Palpita referring to the rating issue said a device was installed in nearly 400 randomly selected TV sets to collect data. He said three major media organisations bought nearly 300 television sets equipped with these devices and as a result, the data received was inaccurate. He said the State-owned media had a greater responsibility than private media organisations and the motive to rise in the channel ratings was a futile move negating the purpose of the issue in question. The matter regarding Media identity cards was discussed where COPA officials said a system should be put in place where journalists actively contributing to media outlets should be given Journalist IDs. Eighteen functions of the Department that were prioritised were also discussed.  A system to provide local information to foreign countries and vice versa through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs came under the microscope.

The Director General of Samurdhi said this process has already started in five districts and the bank networking will be completed by December this year. Moreover, the importance of providing the ongoing relief subsidy through the Samurdhi Bank system was also discussed. Attention was also drawn to the recommendation given to investigate the major financial irregularity in the ‘Damana’ Divisional Secretariat of providing fishing nets to the prosperous for livelihood. Officials said an investigation is underway into this matter, which was carried out together with the Divisional Secretariat sans a proper procurement process.  The COPA Chair said he will inform the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration in a letter to investigate the concerned Samurdhi officials as well as the concerned regional secretary. There was an extensive discussion about not being subjected to the audit of the Auditor General. It was disclosed that the Attorney General was also consulted regarding this. The Auditor General and the Committee were of the view that the Samurdhi Banks are under the Samurdhi Department and therefore fit for auditing. Thus, the Committee informed to consider the matter and take necessary steps immediately. State Ministers Diana Gamage, Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, MPs A.L.M. Athaullah, Mano Ganesan, D.

This includes the installation of pumps, the extension of water pipes for Dansal areas, installation of 400 water taps around the Anuradhapura Sacred City, Mihintale, and Thanthirimale shrines, water supply by water bowsers, and extension of water pipes for temporary toilet systems constructed by Municipal and Local Councils.  Water Supply and Drainage Board Chairman Nishantha Ranatunga said the cost of these water-related services, including the installation of water tanks and tap systems at gathering places and providing water to the tanks along the Perahara route for the elephants, amounts to Rs 15.7 million (excluding VAT), which will be covered corporately. The Ministry of Defence has deployed troops from the Armed Forces and the Civil Service Department (CSD) to construct the Anuradhapura Poson Zone, encompassing Mihintale, Thanthirimale, and Sandahiru Seya. The offering of afternoon alms to the 60,000 worshippers observing ‘Sil’ at the Udamaluwa and Mihintale will be carried out with contributions from all the Divisional Secretariat Offices in the Anuradhapura District. Further, the Bank of Ceylon will provide the evening ‘Gilan Pasa’ for devotees who observe ‘Sil’ during the festival. The Anuradhapura Municipal Council has already commenced the construction of 350 portable toilets and the Mihintale Pradeshiya Sabha will set up 80 portable toilets around the Mihintale sacred site for the sanitary convenience of the visiting pilgrims. A special security committee consisting of North Central Province SDIG, Anuradhapura DIG, Anuradhapura SSP and OIC of the Mihintale Police have been appointed on the advice of the IGP for the safety of the pilgrims and the implementation of the traffic plan.  Sri Lanka Railways has also provided special transport facilities during the Poson week. Accordingly, 10 additional trains have been deployed and steps have also been taken to increase train commutes, the General Manager of Railways said. Meanwhile, the Anuradhapura District Secretary says that the Sri Lanka Transport Board and the Road Passenger Transport Authority will jointly operate a special bus service. Thus, it appears that Rs 28.8 million has been allocated for Mihintale Poson programmes solely by two Government Ministries and one Department. However, the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. (Lake House), which is a financial sponsor for various activities in the Poson programme, has informed the Mihintale Poson Committee that it cannot contribute to the programmes this year due to dire financial conditions."

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

Soaring inflation has battered the economy for more than a year after a severe foreign exchange crisis set off the country’s worst financial crisis in seven decades. The Colombo Consumer Price Index (LKCCPI=ECI) (CCPI) reflected a reduction in food inflation to 21.5% in May from 30.6% in April, while non-food inflation reached 27%, the Census and Statistics Department said in a statement. “Coming off a high base is helping Sri Lanka’s inflation reduce rapidly and we expect this to continue in the coming months,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research at First Capital. “Sri Lanka is on track to hit single-digit inflation by September or, perhaps, even a bit earlier,” he added. Easing inflation is also likely to prompt the Central Bank to keep its policy rates unchanged.

The grievances faced by the plantation communities were highlighted by various individual trade union leaders forming separate unions’ indifferent towns in the plantation sector, since the arrival of the community in Sri Lanka in 1823. It was a difficult task to solve some of the main grievances of the community. The initiative was taken by the great Leader Mahatma Gandhi and as a result the late Indian Prime Minister Sri Jawaharlal Nehru visited Sri Lanka as his representative in 1937.  He met the various individual leaders and urged them to form one large union to fight to resolve the grievances of the Indian origin Tamils and as a result the Ceylon Indian Congress (CIC) formed. Desigar Ramanujam was one of the founding members. The CIC became later the Ceylon Workers Congress CWC. The Late Desigar Ramanujam’s 55th death anniversary falls on 5th June 2023. Ramanujam was born in Ramanathapuram, South India on 17 July 1907. Upon completing his higher studies he commenced a career in journalism. In the late 1920s Ramanujam, by then an accomplished writer, came to Sri Lanka and joined the editorial staff of a Tamil Newspaper Desa Bakthan.  He also served as a correspondent for the Tamil daily Virakesari. In 1943 he joined the teaching staff at Dharmaraja College, Kandy. Due to his fluency in English and Tamil he was called upon by the Courts in Kandy to assist them in translating evidences from Tamil to English. During this period, noticing difficulties encountered by the poor Tamil workers, particularly working in the Kandy Municipal Council, he went on to form an Association under the name Bose Sangam. These efforts were to safeguard the rights of Indian workers who lived in Mahiyawa and Asgiriya. Ramanujam was elected to the Kandy Municipal Council in 1943. He represented the Asgiriya ward and in 1946 became the first person of Indian Origin to be elected as the Deputy Mayor of Kandy. During this period he was credited with providing pipe-borne water to the Asgiriya Maha Viharaya of Asgiriya Chapter. He had the blessing of the Venerable Mahanayaka Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter who urged the residents of Asgiriya Ward to support Ramanujam, who served the ward for 13 successive years. Ramanujam was elected at the first Parliamentary Elections held between 23 August 1947 and September 1947. He contested as an independent candidate in the Aluthnuwara Electorate (presently Mahiyangana) securing 46.6% of the total vote; 1437 votes ahead of his nearest rival. He defeated three candidates from the majority community. He thus became one of the seven CIC members elected to Parliament in 1947. Ramanujam worked tirelessly for the rights of the plantation workers as the joint Secretary of the Ceylon Workers Congress. He represented Sri Lanka as the workers’ delegate at several Annual meetings of the International Labour Organization (ILO). His contributions at these sessions were well appreciated. In 1961 Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike offered Ramanujam an appointed MP seat in Parliament because of the close friendship he had with the late SWRD Bandaranaike and with the Prime Minister. But he declined it in favour of Ceylon Workers Congress President Savumyamurthi Thondaman; much to the disappointment of the Premier. The Prime Minister wasn’t happy, but it took a lot of convincing by Ramanujam to make Mrs. Bandaranaike offer the MP post to Thondaman. In 1962, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) recognizing his contribution to the trade union movement and his achievements at the ILO meetings invited him to join their organization, where he was given the task of organizing the sugar plantation workers in Mauritius. He was subsequently sent to Ethiopia to establish Trade Unions during the regime of Emperor Haisalasi. In 1965 ICFTU appointed Ramanujam as the special representative in Singapore. His task was to persuade the National Trade Union Congress of Singapore to amend its constitution to become an internationally accepted Trade Union. He was then made Regional Director in South East Asia. In 1968 the ICFTU appointed Ramanujam as the Director of Asian Region (He had to be based in India). However he died unexpectedly on 4th June 1968 before he could take up the posting. Thus, the international trade union movement lost a simple human being who served the cause of the workers in Sri Lanka and internationally. It is pertinent to note that Dr. Prathap Ramanujam, son of Desire Ramanujam the only surviving person from the generation of any of the founding members, has been recently appointed as a Civil Society independent member of the Constitutional Council in recognition of his nonpartisan service to country and also as a senior public servant particularly to the plantation  sector when   he was appointed as the first Secretary of the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure when it was created for the benefit of the plantation workers.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/01/catholic-church-urges-to-probe-attempt-to-disrupt-religious-harmony/,Catholic Church urges to probe attempt to disrupt religious harmony,Author not found,0,2023-05-31T20:31:00+00:00," The Catholic Church of Sri Lanka requested a fair and independent investigation into allegations that some people and organisations were trying to disrupt religious harmony in the country. Spokesman for the Colombo Archdiocese, Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando said it is the responsibility of the Police and the CID to conduct comprehensive, transparent, fair and independent investigations and uncover the truth about people and organisations suspected of insulting Buddhism and other religions in this country. Addressing the media at the Colombo Archbishop’s House, Fr. Fernando yesterday (31) alleged that there were politicians who sought to create conflicts between religions and races endangering country’s security in order to gain power.  “They used main stream media and social media to plan out such conflicts. The current religious divergence is a part of such a modus operandi of capturing power and becoming rich capitalists living comfortable and luxurious lives while the people and the country go through unbearable hardship and poverty”, he added. “We condemn insulting religious beliefs and religious leaders and urge those who come forward on social media to respond to such matter to refrain from adding fuel to fire,” Fr. Fernando appealed. These persons or groups only serve the purpose of knowingly or unknowingly creating disputes amongst the people, he noted. The Spokesman for the Colombo Archdiocese accused such persons of misusing freedom of speech to spread false information sans investigating the veracity of facts. Reading out a media announcement released by the General Manager of Catholic Private Schools (Western Province), Archdiocese Colombo, Fr. Gamunu Dias he said that false news spreading through public and social media regarding Nathasha Edirisooriya who had been arrested for her controversial statements had not used the auditoriums in any of the Catholic Schools to serve her purpose. She was also not a past pupil of a Catholic Girls’ School as some social media would have the public believe. Fr. Fernando urged the public who appreciate peace and harmony in the country to beware of such people and expressions without being a slave to emotions by acting with intelligence. He also appealed to media personnel – especially and social media activists and social media network operators to verify facts prior to disseminating information. “It is the duty of main stream or social media to do so as the focal point of media freedom lay with the people’s right to accurate, truthful information”, he stressed. Noting that he was speaking on behalf of the Cardinal who was out of the country,  Fr. Fernando said, “We condemn the statements made in a way that is offensive to the main religion of this country, the Buddha, Buddhism and Buddhist culture,” the Spokesman said. Police should probe statements publicised on social media and some mainstream media that wasoffensive to Buddhism and all other religions, religious beliefs and their religious leaders, while the law should apply fairly to all, he said. Fielding questions regarding a statement made by Minister of Justice that some organisations received funds from abroad, the Spokesman said the Minister should take measures to investigate such information with assistance from the Police and the CID instead of holding on to it and doing nothing. “It is not enough to just make statements regarding such matters, they should be investigated,” he added.

Minister Alles gave this instruction at the Ministerial Consultative Committee meeting, held recently in Parliament. The committee also approved the orders given by the Minister of Public Security, under the Immigrants and Emigrants Act, to revise the fine of USD 500 in addition to the visa fees for foreigners who have overstayed their visa validity period. Thus, it has been recommended that no penalty shall be levied for departure at a port, approved by the Department of Immigration and Emigration, within seven days or less, than the period of overstaying a valid visa, without extending the visa, to levy a penalty of USD 250 for an overstaying period of more than seven days and overstaying period of 14 days or less and to levy a penalty of USD 500 for overstaying period of more than 14 days. This step has been taken following requests made by various parties regarding the promotion of tourism, attracting investors and the inconvenience caused to officials working in foreign missions operating in Sri Lanka due to having to pay the above penalty. These orders are to be approved by the Parliament on a future date. Meanwhile, the members drew the attention of the Committee to the need to take steps to appreciate officers involved in drug raids.

This new process aims to streamline the passport application process and ensure that passports are delivered to applicants’ residences within a span of three days. During his appearance on the ‘101 Katha’ programme, produced by the President’s Media Division (PMD), he highlighted the development of this procedure and its wide availability. To facilitate the efficient delivery of passports, 50 Regional Secretariats, across the island, have been equipped with the necessary facilities. Once applicants submit their applications to the nearest Regional Secretariat and complete the required procedures, the passport will be dispatched to their residence, via a courier service, within three days. This initiative comes in response to reports of brokers causing disruptions in the passport issuance process. Minister of Public Security, Tiran Alles, issued instructions to the Immigration and Emigration Department to develop an innovative programme to eliminate such interference. The department aims to popularise this newly designed programme during the month of June, marking a significant milestone in its history. Achieving a successful execution of this programme during the department’s 75th anniversary next year would be a remarkable accomplishment. Under the new system, individuals can conveniently apply for passports from their homes by visiting www.immigration.gov.lk. By selecting the ‘Apply for passports’ option and validating the provided information, applicants will receive the necessary application form. Before uploading the soft copy of the form, applicants can specify whether they prefer the expedited ‘three day service’ or the standard ‘two week service.’ Following this, applicants must visit their Divisional Secretariat to provide their fingerprints and make the required payment via the online system offered by the Bank of Ceylon. For those unable to complete the process at home, they can visit a photo studio, authorised by the Immigration and Emigration Department to obtain the necessary documents and fulfil the requirements. In case, individuals encounter difficulties making online payments after visiting the Divisional Secretariat and providing their fingerprints, alternative payment facilities are available. After submitting their fingerprints, the Divisional Secretariat will provide a designated number, which can be presented to the Bank of Ceylon. The amount due will then be transferred to the Immigration and Emigration Department. To support these efforts, fingerprint scanners and cameras have been set up in the 50 Divisional Secretariat Offices and the Department of Posts has introduced a dedicated courier service. Through a collaborative arrangement with the postal service, passports will be delivered to applicants’ residences using this courier service, ensuring a swift three-day turnaround. Furthermore, comprehensive measures have been implemented to prevent any irregularities in the process, with the utilisation of advanced technology to the fullest extent possible to maintain efficiency and integrity."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Can you delete it please and apologise immediately?” Which Dissanayake replied “Sorry I hurt you @rickygervais but I’m not going to delete my tweet because that’s my freedom of expression mate.” Gervais replied to Dissanayake’s tweet as “Bingo,” indicating that he has proved his point.  When Ceylon Today spoke to Dissanayake in this regard he noted that, he doesn’t care the tweets between him and Gervais are going viral.

Sources at the NWPD-APHD said yesterday (30), when contacted, that about 2,000 animals from 35 areas were infected with the virus. But the Province has been affected by Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) before and the infection lasts for about two weeks, they noted. However, while advising the public to refrain from consuming beef, they said that milk production in the province would also drop as a result of the fever that LSD caused. They said that about 155,000 litres of milk was produced daily within the province on normal days. Explaining, they said infected cattle that appeared to be in a more critical condition were treated. Many of the younger animals faced more difficulties when infected. Fielding questions, they noted that only few deaths occurred due to the viral infection. However that too was not as a result of the infection but due to secondary infections caused by bacteria which infected the wounds caused when the nodules burst. Farmers were advised on maintaining hygienic conditions for the cattle to ensure that the wounds were not infected by bacteria while treating them. Meanwhile, informed veterinary sources said that illegal transport of cattle too was one of the main causes for the disease spread as several animals were taken in a single lorry. In addition, the unhygienic conditions which sick cattle was kept were another cause for the disease spread. Normally, sick animals should be separated from the rest of the herd as they too were vulnerable to the disease. Some farmers failed to pay attention to such details. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

With a significant year-on-year decline of 17 per cent in April, the industry has been severely impacted. De Silva emphasised the crucial role the textile and apparel industry played during the economic crisis, lending crucial support to keep the country afloat and providing employment opportunities to hundreds of thousands of people. “Decreased Global Demand during the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a decrease in global demand for clothing, resulting in domestic wardrobe inventory build-up. This reduction in demand has affected the textile industry, particularly as big brands, anticipating a post-Covid surge, now face inventory build-ups in their warehouses. Factory Closures and Competitive Environment, as a consequence of the challenging market conditions, several factories have closed down, and others have been forced to place their workers on furlough. The competitive landscape in the textile industry has intensified as brands dictate cheaper prices, turning it into an auction-like scenario among countries in the region,” he added. Speaking about Long-term Outlook and Government Initiatives the MP stressed the importance of protecting the vital textile industry, as the problem is expected to persist for another 6-12 months. He urged the Government to take immediate action, including a reevaluation and amendment of the 30 per cent taxe on exports to alleviate the financial burden faced by exporters. He highlighted the significant increase in spending power among Indians, particularly in States like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala. He called for measures to attract India’s growing middle class and suggested renegotiating the existing Free Trade Agreement to remove barriers that restrict exports above USD eight million. Speaking about ‘Seizing Opportunities from Shifting Investments’ with corporations and foreign direct investments moving out of China and relocating to countries like Vietnam, Singapore, and India he urged the Government to establish mechanisms similar to India to attract these investments. This would provide opportunities for the textile industry to grow and flourish. He called for action underlining the importance of supporting Sri Lanka’s textile and apparel export sector during these challenging times. By implementing the proposed measures, the Government can mitigate the impact of the crisis, revitalise the industry, and position Sri Lanka for long-term growth and sustainability. (NV)"

The flight will take about six hours. The cage is strong and is enclosed on all sides. The elephant will stand throughout the flight and no sedative will be administered, to avoid any side effects, said Sittidet. Thongsuk will be with the elephant throughout the journey to keep it calm and to provide food and water, he said, adding that this mission is quite challenging, but due to Thongsuk spending about six months with the elephant in Sri Lanka, he is confident that the journey will go smoothly. Upon arrival at Chiang Mai airport, Saksurin will be trucked to the elephant hospital in Lampang, which has a spacious area in which the elephant can roam in a natural environment, unlike the limited space it has had for the past 21 years in Sri Lanka, said the vet. He believes that Saksurin will enjoy a happy old age in Lampang. Prasert Sornsathapornkul, chief of the Wildlife and Plants Conservation Division, said that the total cost of repatriating Saksurin is estimated to be about 24.7 million baht and a special budget has been sought from the Budget Bureau and its Central Fund.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/05/30/food-insecurity-high-in-north-n-eliya-batticaloa-fao/,"Food Insecurity High in North, N’ Eliya, Batticaloa – FAO",Author not found,0,2023-05-29T20:31:00+00:00,"Food security in Sri Lanka is improving across all provinces, according to the Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) report, jointly carried out in February/March 2023 by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), the FAO said in a statement yesterday. However, the report estimates 3.9 million people or 17 per cent of the population is in moderate acute food insecurity which nonetheless is nearly a 40 per cent decrease from June/July last year. “Nearly10,000 people are severely food-insecure, down from 66,000 people last year,’ FAO added. Nevertheless, the improvement in food security stems from better food consumption, which could be attributed to reduced food prices and improved incomes among farming communities during the harvesting period when the mission was carried out. Despite this positive trend, food insecurity remains high in certain districts, especially Kilinochchi, Nuwara Eliya, Mannar, Batticaloa, Vavuniya, and Jaffna, the FAO warned. The highest level of acute food insecurity was found within the tea plantation communities in the Estate sector and among daily wage labourers and households who rely on social assistance programmes, such as Samurdhi, as their main source of income, it said. Production of cereal, including rice and maize, across the two main cropping seasons in 2022/23 is forecast at 4.1 million tonnes, 14 per cent below the past five-year average, mainly due to poor plant nutrition caused by an inadequate supply of fertiliser and unaffordability of essential material inputs, FAO said. However, essential fertilisers distributed to smallholder farmers by the Government, facilitated by funds received from multilateral and bilateral donor agencies, has significantly impacted production, marking an improvement in the yield with productivity in the recently harvested 2022/23 ‘Maha’ season, 12 per cent higher than the 2022 ‘Yala’ season, it said. “After many months of challenges, we are finally witnessing an improvement to the country’s food security,” said WFP Sri Lanka Representative and Country Director Abdur Rahim Siddiqui speaking on CFSAM Report findings.  “But there is more to be done. A high number of households – more than 60 per cent – are adopting negative measures to put food on the table, including borrowing money and purchasing food on credit. WFP will extend its emergency operation, which commenced last year, to provide food rations and cash assistance to people identified as food insecure.” FAO Representative to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Vimlendra Sharan said, “The CFSAM report is an eye-opener on the continuing vulnerabilities and challenges that exist within the food systems of Sri Lanka. This report and its findings will no doubt serve as a guiding light for policymakers and stakeholders to collectively work towards ensuring food security, strengthening agricultural resilience and mitigating risks faced by farmers and rural communities who have been disproportionately impacted by the economic crisis. FAO remains committed to supporting Sri Lanka in their efforts towards achieving sustainable food systems, food security and zero hunger.” Mission recommendations:  Provide immediate support to farmers, particularly by releasing available fertiliser stocks to enhance production and productivity in the on-going ‘Yala’ season and make urgent policy decisions to import fertilisers in time for the 2023/24 ‘Maha’ cultivation season. The report also recommends any move for reducing or removing fertiliser subsidy to be in a gradual and phased manner, giving adequate time to the farming community to adapt, FAO said. Other recommendations include: The establishment of a ‘Fertiliser Task Force’ to streamline fertiliser procurement and distributions as well as to strengthen adaptive research on climate smart agriculture and sustainable farming practices to improve fertiliser use efficiency. Further, to minimise the impact on the livestock and fisheries sectors, the mission recommends providing adequate support to increase fodder and feed crop production. Further recommendations include: Continuing food and/or cash assistance to facilitate access to food among households most vulnerable to food insecurity. In the long-term, increased livelihood support to food-insecure households and resilience-building initiatives are also recommended to prevent them from compromising on productivity and their capacity to cope with future shocks. The joint CFSAM is the second to be carried out in the country by FAO and WFP, at the request of the Government. The mission covered all 25 districts in the country between February and March 2023 to analyse the forecasted agricultural output in 2023, particularly of main staple cereals and assess household food security conditions, the statement in conclusion said.

Handunpathiraja advised the public to strictly adhere to health guidelines, drink water regularly to regulate body temperature, and mitigate the risks associated with heat. The Assistant Director clarified that the Meteorology Department calculates an index using atmospheric humidity and maximum temperature data obtained from a global mathematical weather forecasting model. He emphasised that this index represents the heat felt by the body rather than the atmospheric temperature itself. The DMC cautioned that dehydration, muscle spasms, and exhaustion are possible consequences, but timely precautionary measures can help prevent such occurrences. Handunpathiraja highlighted that children playing outdoors are particularly susceptible to temperature-related issues and urged them to drink water frequently and take regular breaks. He also advised individuals working in outdoor settings to hydrate adequately and exercise caution. Elderly individuals and those with underlying health conditions were advised to be extra cautious during the prevailing hot weather conditions. In relation to children, parents and caretakers were strongly advised against leaving them unattended inside vehicles while travelling. Handunpathiraja mentioned that the Ministry of Health has also provided instructions to minimise complications resulting from high temperatures, recommending the avoidance of strenuous activities and the use of light-coloured clothing.

Co- Secretary of Academy of Health Professionals (AHP) Chanaka Dharmawickrema accused the Health Ministry of making no move to rectify the situation despite hospital officials informing the Ministry of this situation.  The Cardiology Unit of the hospital has two Catheterisation Units but the machine in one of the units has been dysfunctional since 6 May. The remaining piece of technology is also under maintenance with a high probability of breaking down in the near future. He said the machine, which was broken, had been installed at the hospital in 2006 and in 2019, the local company that provided the relevant services had informed that the parent company would stop its supply of spare parts for the machine from 31 December 2019. Dharmawickrema said that several tests were performed on cardiac patients using the machines. They include Angiogram studies to detect blockages in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart following which stenting treatment could be done to avoid coronary artery blockages. He said that if the obstruction was too high, they patients were referred for bypass surgery. Also the Cath Labs enable the diagnosing and fixing of hole in the heart patients and also helps diagnose defects in heart valves, he said. The estimated amount for maintenance of the said machine was Rs 26 million while no decision had been taken as to whether maintenance would be carried out under these circumstances. At least 15-20 patients were examined and treated daily on one machine. Last year nearly 7,200 patients were registered, Dharmawickrema said adding that a large number of them had not received the opportunity to be examined and treated till now.

She viewed others’ hardships and problems as her own and resolved our problems with her knowledge, skills and wisdom. She was an excellent communicator who propagated our Ever loving God’s messages in a way that we could easily grasp the subject. She had never hurt anyone’s feelings and advocated that we follow her footsteps when dealing with people. She was an exemplary Educator as well as a leader who had imparted vast amounts of knowledge to us. The late Rev. Sr. Agnes Dorado was a far-sighted thinker and her predictions came true many a times in my life. She had also inculcated many ‘virtues and values’ in us. She taught us the importance of unity and diversity. She encouraged us to work in groups and co-operate with each other thus fostering brotherhood in our lives. She had a knack of understanding each and every individual and catered to their needs. During our spiritual journey with her, I have never seen her being angry and she was always calm and tranquil. During her service period at our church, we had never experienced her refusing to help us. For her, rich and the poor, educated or uneducated, fair or dark in complexion all were the same and she strongly believed in treating all of us equally. The late Rev. Sr. Agnes Dorado also strongly believed in providing equal opportunities for us. I fondly recall the golden days that I had spent with her talking and laughing and leading a joyful life. Whenever I realise that she is no more with us, I feel as if I am stranded alone in the Sahara Desert and continuously weeping in profound sadness. It was an arduous task for me to control my emotions after she departed this materialistic world. But I am optimistic that with our Almighty God ‘s Grace she is now leading a better eternal  life. Let us translate her vision into reality.  May her Soul Rest in Peace. Value Creation and Translation by Maruthai Ravindhiran By M. P. Usha Nilanthani "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/05/29/new-act-on-religious-freedom-likely/,New Act on religious freedom likely,Author not found,0,2023-05-28T20:32:00+00:00," Plans are afoot to introduce new legislation focusing on religious freedom and the prevention of spreading distorted information about religions, Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural affairs Vidura Wickramanayake said yesterday (28). Speaking to Ceylon Today, Wickramanayake said this new legislation is to avoid attempts to ‘disrespect’ and ‘distort’ religions. The Minister’s statement came in the backdrop of the arrest of Nathasha Edirisooriya, under Section 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act, over the allegations of ‘insulting Buddhism’ during a stand-up comedy event held on 1 April in Colombo. Edirisooriya was arrested at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) on 27 May by the CID. Speaking about the arrest, Wickramanayake said the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs lodged a complaint with the Inspector General of Police (IGP) seeking Edirisooriya’s arrest. Edirisooriya was remanded until 7 June when she was produced before Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage yesterday (28). However, the Minister accepted that he did not watch the video clip of Edirisooriya’s full performance at the stand-up comedy event as “he did not want to add one more view to the video on social media.” When questioned, how the proposed legislation differs from the existing ICCPR Act, the Minister claimed both the ICCPR and the Penal Code are there to take action after an incident has taken place. “But this new Act aims to prevent such incidents from happening,” he claimed. In response to the query as to whether the proposed legislation is similar to the draconian blasphemy laws in several other countries in the world, the Minister said there is no need to be “that strict.” “However, there should be some way to stop these incidents from happening, because insulting religions is insulting our culture.” It is true that as a nation we are weak in economic terms. However, we are not mentally weak. We are a proud nation and organised attempts to destroy that should be prevented,” he claimed. Speaking further, Wickramanayake said he personally believes that those who ‘distort’ religions and the persons who upload such statements to the social media should both be punished according to the law.  The use of ICCPR Act in Sri Lanka sparked controversy as allegations have been levelled in both local and international level that the authorities use the Act to suppress freedom of speech rather than protecting the political and human rights of the citizens.

Jaishankar stressed on Saturday (27). The Modi Government, he underlined, is working on developing an “extended neighbourhood” that involves islands in the Indian Ocean, Gulf countries and nations in South-East Asia. “What we are also trying to do today is for a bigger, influential and ambitious India. We are trying to expand what should be our neighbourhood. We look at what this extended neighbourhood should be. It could be islands in the Indian Ocean, nations in South-East Asia and Central Asia, or Gulf countries. The relationship with the UAE and Saudi Arabia has undergone an enormous transformation. From what was a traditionally much more constricted view of our neighbourhood, we have undertaken something much more ambitious,” said Jaishankar during a talk on ‘Modi’s India: A Rising Power’ at Anant National University in the city. Pointing out how the world has become more uncertain, Jaishankar underlined it was time to use the “complex global landscape” for the betterment and growth of India. The pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia conflict has helped to build “resilient and reliable supply chains, domestic capacities and trusted relationships,” he highlighted. Jaishankar also spoke about the ‘linkages’ and ‘perception’ India has developed in the last nine years under the leadership of Prime Minister NarendraModi. “If you are the biggest in your neighbourhood, then it is in our interest that our other neighbours have a share in our prosperity, happiness and are linked to us. That will happen if we are generous and have a non-reciprocal way of engagement. Many of our neighbours like Bangladesh or Nepal and Bhutan are today linked with us through roads, railways, and waterways. We have electricity grid connections, there are fuel supplies. In many ways, they benefit from the scale and economy of India,” Jaishankar said while addressing an audience largely composed of students and faculty members from the private university. “The linkages and perception today of India in the neighbourhood has changed. Nothing illustrated that more dramatically than what happened to Sri Lanka. Last year, when they went through a very deep economic crisis, we stepped forward in a way we ourselves have never done before. What we have done for Sri Lanka is bigger than what the IMF has done for Sri Lanka. If any of you have visited Sri Lanka recently, then you will note the popular perception that has accrued from this action,” he added."

Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) organised the high-Level cross-party discussion with Party Leaders, Party Secretaries and their representatives on the Anti-Corruption Bill in Parliament on Thursday (25)to improve and see its timely passage in Parliament. The MPs were briefed on the improvements which could be incorporated at the Committee Stage (Third Reading) of the Bill. The discussions were made keeping in mind that the Bill was before the Supreme Court. While agreeing that the proposed Bill has many progressive provisions, which were a timely need in the country, MPs on both sides of the Divide, highlighted that the real challenge is to make sure that the anti-graft mechanisms proposed in the Bill are able to break the existing corruption chain, so that ‘business as usual’ was not possible thereafter. Foreign Affairs State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) General Secretary MP Sagara Kariyawasam and SLPP MP Madura Vithanage attended the discussion representing the Government, while Opposition Leader and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader Sajith Premadasa, SJB MPs Eran Wickremaratne, Dr. Harsha de Silva, Mayantha Dissanayake, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader MP Rauff Hakeem, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M. A. Sumanthiran, PC, and MPs Dullas Alahapperuma, Chandima Weerakkody and Weerasumana Weerasinghe participated representing the Opposition and other independent groups in Parliament.     TISL Executive Director Nadishani Perera urged the cross-party support to pass the best possible version of the Anti-Corruption law in Parliament, and to enable  full implementation, since it is a call of the people. “Now the responsibility of this Bill is with Parliament and you have a historic opportunity to demonstrate your commitment towards a system change by taking this Bill as an important step to reform the anti-corruption legal framework in Sri Lanka,” she underlined. Commenting on the new system of the Declarations of Assets and Liabilities (DALs) proposed in the Bill, MPs Chandima Weerakkody and Madura Vithanage pointed out that verifying the information given in DALs is an onerous task that requires time, coordination and financial investment. TISL Advocacy and Research Manager, Janithrika Jayasundara explained that the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) is allowed to cross-check information in the DALs with other relevant institutions and the electronic system, as suggested in the Bill, should highlight  illicit gains.  The lack of means to prevent collusion in corruption was questioned by Deputy Minister Tharaka Balasuriya. MP Eran Wickramaratne proposed to establish an Independent Public Prosecutors’ Office, when TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran pointed out that the Attorney General’s Office withdrawing indictments filed before the Court for criminal offences has become a problematic practice in recent times. Responding to the issues raised by the MPs, TISL Deputy Executive Director Sankhitha Gunaratne pointed out that the Anti-Corruption Bill does not address the whole gamut of issue of corruption, but it would be a good start, as the prevailing Anti-Corruption laws in the country were outdated. She pointed out that more legislation, especially for stolen asset recovery and government procurement, would need to be passed after this Bill.       TISL Advocacy and Research Officer, Lasanthika Hettiarachchi apprised the MPs on the new offences that were included in the Bill. People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections Executive Director, Rohana Hettiarachchi, Centre for Policy Alternatives Executive Director, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, National Peace Council Executive Director, Dr. Jehan Perera and Nishantha Prithiraj of the Sarvodaya Movement attended the meeting representing civil society organisations."

Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Abeywardena expressed confidence that under President Wickremesinghe’s leadership, Sri Lanka’s economy is being normalised, paving the way for the country’s rapid development and resolution of various issues. Speaking to the media in Galle, Abeywardena stressed the importance of all people’s representatives working collaboratively to rebuild the nation, setting aside political differences and personal agendas. During President Wickremesinghe’s visit to Japan, he held meetings with key officials, including the Japanese Prime Minister, to discuss measures being taken to address the economic crisis. The President emphasised the necessity of international assistance, particularly from friendly nations like Japan. Abeywardena noted that the Japanese government has shown a positive outlook towards Sri Lanka. Abeywardena urged the representatives to reach a national consensus and prioritise the country’s reconstruction for the sake of future generations. He said  it was time for everyone to prioritise the nation’s well-being. Given the unstable state Sri Lanka has experienced, with leaders unable to implement long-term national plans or leaving politics prematurely, Abeywardena highlighted the need to depart from outdated political practices.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa queried if there was a conflict within the Government, as ruling party members appear to purposely delay implementing what President Ranil Wickremesinghe has already agreed to. “Even though President Ranil Wickremesinghe had agreed to appoint SJB MP Harsha de Silva, as the Chairman of Public Finance Committee, the members of the selections committee had sought a meeting with the President for a further discussion on reservations they have with regard to the appointment,” Chief Government Whip Prasanna Ranatunga said in response. Ranatunga said,  the Government has no issue with the appointment of SJB MP Dr. Harsha de Silva as the head of the Finance Committee of Parliament. However, he noted that certain MPs of the Government have had reservations about the conduct of the SJB MP ahead of his appointment to the Finance Committee. Ranatunga mentioned that due to this situation, the Government MPs were ready to have a fresh round of talks, overseen by the President, with the Opposition MPs. He was responding to a question posed by Opposition Leader MP Sajith Premadasa over the perceived delay on the part of the Government over the appointment of the lawmaker concerned to head the Finance Committee. Premadasa: “We have already urged the Speaker to intervene to resolve this matter. Afterwards the President held talks with two of our MPs Kabir Hashim and Dr. Harsha de Silva. Then the President had advised to appoint Dr. de Silva as the head of the Finance Committee. We then waited to see if the Government was going to appoint the MP concerned to the said Committee. However, now we have suspicions whether there are any internal issues in the Government over its failure to carry out the President’s instructions. We have no clue as to what has prevented the Government from making this appointment. We also wonder whether this regime is attempting to appoint one of its henchmen to this particular post. Therefore, we would like to request the Speaker to resolve this matter and there is no use in talking any further about it. As the President has given a directive we do not intend to attend any further talks in this regard.” Ranatunga: I do not know whether the Chief Opposition Whip had failed to adequately brief the Opposition Leader on this issue. If that has been the case then the real issues lie with the Opposition and not with us. During yesterday’s discussion the Opposition had submitted two proposals. We spoke about it as well. However, the Chief Opposition Whip decided to withdraw one of those proposals. We too agreed to it. We have no major concern regarding Dr. de Silva. But, at the same time it has to be stated that some of our MPs have had certain reservations regarding his conduct on certain matters. The Opposition stood for the defeat of the proposal to oust the former PUCSL Chairman from his post. During that debate we heard what the Opposition MPs said. Some of our MPs have informed us that they need to have a further round of talks with the President over the appointment of Harsha de Silva. This journey has to be traversed based on understanding. If the Opposition is unwilling to attend discussions, then you could avoid it there is no issue over it. You are saying that we should work in unity. If that is the case then there should be an ideal environment created for it. If you are saying one thing here and then uttering something else outside then how could we work in consensus. Therefore I urge you to think about it and let us work in consensus and not with ulterior motives. Do not forget that the President is not from the SLPP. He is from a different party and he constantly reminds us of this.  Hence, I urge you all to join the talks with the President.  Chief Opposition Whip MP Lakshman Kiriella: “I too was part of yesterday’s discussion. The Chief Government Whip is insisting that Government MPs are opposed to this appointment. There is no such thing mentioned in the Standing Orders. Show me where it has been stipulated that certain appointments cannot be made due to objections of certain MPs. This is a misconception spread by this regime. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena: “We all agreed yesterday.” Kiriella: “The Chief Government Whip is talking about jungle law here”.  Ranatunga: “The Speaker, we yesterday deliberated at length regarding what has been mentioned in the Standing Orders. The Chief Opposition Whip who is talking about the so-called jungle law also agreed for it yesterday.” (GW)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena advised the Governors to, with the intervention of all the relevant authorities, take urgent measures to prevent the spread of dengue. Governors alerted PM Gunawardena that there is a tendency for dengue mosquitoes to breed around construction sites, schools and places of religious importance. With 36,914 cases of dengue being recorded from the beginning of this year, till yesterday (25), concerned government authorities have urged all Heads of State institutions to allocate Friday of every week as a day for inspecting their respective institutions for breeding grounds and clearing, Consultant Community Physician NDCU, Dr. Nimalka Pannilahetti noted. She said, the NDCU had met the Prime Minister and the Provincial Governors yesterday (25), and had mobilised the heads of institutions to help Health Authorities in their relevant provinces to help control the mosquito-borne diseaes. Fielding questions she said, that the Regional Director Health Service (RDHS) areas in the Gampaha District may have resulted in the number of dengue cases surpassing Colombo District this year.  Data given by the Densys Surveillance, from January to May third week, the Gampaha District has a total 8,302 (22.5%) cases while Colombo has 7,717 (20.9%) of the dengue cases in the country. With 18,265, the Western Province, including Kalutara (2245), has 49.5% of the dengue cases. Addressing the discussion that was held to discuss the progress of dengue control programmes, at Temple Trees, yesterday (25), through Zoom, PM Gunawardena emphasised the importance of collecting information about the spread of dengue in their jurisdictions and taking measures to control the disease since priority should be given to preventing the spread of the disease through the continuous implementation of programmes conducted by the regional medical offices of health. The discussion was held with the participation of Governors, Provincial Council Secretaries, Provincial Government Commissioners and Provincial Health Service Directors. The Governors commented on the measures taken so far in the respective provinces to control the dengue disease and its progress. They mentioned that as there is a tendency for dengue mosquitoes to breed around construction sites, schools and places of religious importance, more attention will be paid to keep such places clean with the contribution of health and security sectors. Informed sources said, Presidential Task Force on Dengue Prevention and Control had been reactivated with a nudge by the President earlier this week.  President Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed the Governor of the Western Province, Chief Secretary and the District Secretary in early May 2023 to mobilise the Dengue Task Force to control the spread of dengue in the Western Province with support from relevant institutions and the public. The Task Force was first established in 2017 when dengue shot over 180 000. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/05/26/hrcsl-commissioners-say-chair-acting-arbitrarily-unethically/,"HRCSL Commissioners say Chair acting ‘arbitrarily, unethically’",Author not found,0,2023-05-25T20:50:00+00:00,"The festering conflict within the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), between the Commissioners and the Chairperson, has come to a head, with three Commissioners requesting an urgent meeting with the President to explain the ‘unfortunate situation’ that has arisen in the Commission, due to the ‘arbitrary and unethical behavour’ of the Chairperson of the Commission. Commissioners, Dr. Vijitha Nanayakkara, Dr. Nimal Karunasiri and Ven. Kalupahane Piyarathana Thera, have pointed out, in their request for a meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe that the conflict between the Commissioners and the Chairperson started when arbitrary decisions were taken by the Chairperson to conduct some inquiries as per her own interest and some unknown political motivations. Commissioner Dr. Vijitha Nanayakkara confirmed to Ceylon Today, last evening, that the three Commissioners have sought a meeting with the President to address this matter as the current happenings at the Commission are in complete violation of the HRCSL Act. “The main issue we want to discuss with the President is that the Chairperson takes arbitrary decisions, without heeding the views of the Commissioners. The majority of the Commissioners are dissatisfied with the way she completely disregards the Commissioners when taking decisions. This is actually not a new issue. This has been happening from the time she had been appointed as Chairperson. Now it has come to a point where we no longer can work in the Commission,” Dr. Nanayakkara stressed. He added, “We don’t come under a Ministry. We come directly under the purview of the Presidential Secretariat. What we are seeking is a solution to this problem. This cannot go on for much longer. Either they should remove us and keep the Chairperson, or remove her and keep us. Or, remove all of us. The situation is deadlocked. What is happening is against the law, a complete violation of the HRCSL Act. Dr. Nanayakkara explained that according to the HRCSL Act, “The Commission shall consist of five members” and that the power lies with the Commission. “As the CEO of the Commission, she can take some administrative decisions. But, anyway, it is not to appoint someone, to transfer someone, or matters pertaining to finances. These come under the Commission. But she has taken some decisions without asking for directives from the Commission. That is the issue here.” The Commissioner added that the majority of the Commissioners find it that they cannot support some of the decisions taken by the Chairperson and that they cannot take the responsibility for them. “The only option we have for this issue is to write to the President. Unfortunately, we have not yet received an appointment with the President to discuss this matter.” HRCSL Commissioner, Dr. Nimal Karunasiri, speaking to Ceylon Today, also confirmed that the three Commissioners are seeking a meeting with the President to urge an immediate solution to the conflict within the HRCSL as it causes a grave injustice to the people.  “According to the HRCSL Act, the powers are vested with the Commission. But, the Chairperson is acting arbitrarily, according to her personal view, disregarding the decisions taken by the Commission. Despite the Commissioners trying to resolve this issue amicably, the Chairperson insists that she holds sole authority. This has been happening for some time. From March this year in particular, most of the decisions taken by the Commission were reached without the consensus of the Commissioners,” Dr. Karunasiri explained. He also pointed out that as the President is the authority that appoints the Commissioners, he is the person to whom the Commissioners should complain to in this instance. “It has been two or three months since the Constitutional Council has called for applications for new Commissions to be appointed. However, there seems to be a delay in appointing new members to the HRCSL. In such a context, when issues such as internal conflicts get the public attention, it creates a great injustice to the people. “Therefore, we want to urge the President to appoint Commissioners to the HRCSL on an urgent basis. We are not insisting that we should be reappointed. If none of us are good enough, then appoint new Commissioners and put an end to this impasse. This is our request to the President. “When issues such these are allowed to fester, it does not affect us personally. These only affect the people of this country. Although she is named the Chairperson, she is also a Commissioner. She cannot take decisions arbitrarily. They have to be taken with the consensus of the majority members.” The Commissioners also allege that the Chairperson blatantly ignores the importance of conducting regular Board of Commissioners meetings and violates the HRCSL Act. The Commissioners have requested the meeting with the President to specifically explain all the problems in the Commission for necessary action by the President. The HRCSL Chairperson aroused a controversy in March this year, when she arbitrarily decided to summon the Minister of Public Security, without consulting the other four Commissioners. The Four HRCSL Commissioners insisted at that time that they did not take a decision to summon the Minister of Public Security to appear before the Commission to record a statement. This revelation ultimately forced the HRCSL Chairperson to withdraw the summons and issue a clarification."

Wickremesinghe took the stage at the ‘Nikkei Forum: Future of Asia’ held in Tokyo, Japan. During his address, the President emphasised the Government’s approach to the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific regions. In the presence of esteemed world dignitaries, including the Deputy Prime Ministers of Singapore and Vietnam, Wickremesinghe highlighted the importance of Asian States having a voice in shaping the region’s role amidst the evolving geopolitics on the global stage. He acknowledged the diverse nature of Asia as a contributing factor to the region’s economic growth, establishing it as a significant global player. Wickremesinghe elaborated on the distinction between the Asia-Pacific region and the Indian Ocean, stating that while the former possesses a structured regional organisation, the latter remains an evolving space. Emphasising the adherence to the principles established in the 1955 Asian African Conference in Bandung and the UN Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, Wickremesinghe reaffirmed Sri Lanka’s commitment to fostering multi-layered connectivity in the Indo-Pacific. Additionally, Wickremesinghe expressed full support for Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s ‘Principles for Peace and Rules for Prosperity’ Policy. Wickremesinghe emphasised that Asian nations would refrain from taking sides in the global Big Power rivalry, as many have chosen to prioritise the progress and development of Asia. In conclusion, Wickremesinghe welcomed the cooperative approach of Japan and the G7 in building a stable relationship with China. He supported Japan’s vision for a ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific’ and called for an open-ended dialogue among Asian nations to foster peace and cooperation in the region. “Claiming nearly 30% of the Earth’s land mass, Asia is home to 4.75 billion people, which is about 60% of the world’s population. The region is now the world’s largest economy. Despite setbacks on the global stage, Asia has the potential for continued growth. China’s recovery, together with a healthy domestic demand in India, will be the main supports of growth for the region. Asia also has the advanced economies of Japan and South Korea contributing to the region’s development, through foreign investments and technology transfers,” he added. Wickremesinghe noted that ASEAN, as the 5th largest economy in the world, is growing at a steady pace. He noted that Asia’s strength is derived from its openness, the territory comprises some of the world’s wealthiest economies and some of the poorest; large sub-continental powers as well as small States. Speaking regarding the Democratic Values and Human Rights, Wickremesinghe noted that Sri Lanka is the oldest Democracy in Asia, with a Parliament tracing its origins to 1835 and universal franchise sustained from 1931. He also addressed the Climate Change as a planet-defining challenge, and the stakes are particularly high for Asia. Wickremesinghe noted that for instance, China has pledged its goal of carbon neutrality before 2060, with Japan and Korea by 2050. Wickremesinghe also speaking regarding Trade Integration the entry of the Asian juggernaut in the form of China, the ASEAN Tigers and India has effectively changed the international economic order of the 20th Century. Speaking about the Ukraine War, Wickremesinghe noted that most of the Asian nations prefer not to be involved in the Ukraine war, though some in the West decry this as an over-extension of neutrality. Nonetheless, diverse opinions on the Ukraine war have emerged within Asia. Also, he noted that Asia has become the crux of US, China rivalry. “The intensification of that rivalry in recent times has brought about the QUAD (between the USA, India, Australia, and Japan) and the Indo-Pacific on one hand and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on the other,” he added. Wickremesinghe added that the Indo-Pacific is an evolving concept with unanswered questions. “The APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) is a structured regional organisation, which includes channels of dialogue between the US and China. However, on the other hand, the Indian Ocean is amorphous,” he added. He noted that there is no effective regional political system, nor structures to deal with economic or security matters. (NV)"

The index is the sum of the year-end unemployment, inflation, and bank-lending rates, minus the annual percentage change in real GDP per capita.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa queried if there was a conflict within the Government, as ruling party members appear to purposely delay implementing what President Ranil Wickremesinghe has already agreed to. “Even though President Ranil Wickremesinghe had agreed to appoint SJB MP Harsha de Silva, as the Chairman of Public Finance Committee, the members of the selections committee had sought a meeting with the President for a further discussion on reservations they have with regard to the appointment,” Chief Government Whip Prasanna Ranatunga said in response. Ranatunga said,  the Government has no issue with the appointment of SJB MP Dr. Harsha de Silva as the head of the Finance Committee of Parliament. However, he noted that certain MPs of the Government have had reservations about the conduct of the SJB MP ahead of his appointment to the Finance Committee. Ranatunga mentioned that due to this situation, the Government MPs were ready to have a fresh round of talks, overseen by the President, with the Opposition MPs. He was responding to a question posed by Opposition Leader MP Sajith Premadasa over the perceived delay on the part of the Government over the appointment of the lawmaker concerned to head the Finance Committee. Premadasa: “We have already urged the Speaker to intervene to resolve this matter. Afterwards the President held talks with two of our MPs Kabir Hashim and Dr. Harsha de Silva. Then the President had advised to appoint Dr. de Silva as the head of the Finance Committee. We then waited to see if the Government was going to appoint the MP concerned to the said Committee. However, now we have suspicions whether there are any internal issues in the Government over its failure to carry out the President’s instructions. We have no clue as to what has prevented the Government from making this appointment. We also wonder whether this regime is attempting to appoint one of its henchmen to this particular post. Therefore, we would like to request the Speaker to resolve this matter and there is no use in talking any further about it. As the President has given a directive we do not intend to attend any further talks in this regard.” Ranatunga: I do not know whether the Chief Opposition Whip had failed to adequately brief the Opposition Leader on this issue. If that has been the case then the real issues lie with the Opposition and not with us. During yesterday’s discussion the Opposition had submitted two proposals. We spoke about it as well. However, the Chief Opposition Whip decided to withdraw one of those proposals. We too agreed to it. We have no major concern regarding Dr. de Silva. But, at the same time it has to be stated that some of our MPs have had certain reservations regarding his conduct on certain matters. The Opposition stood for the defeat of the proposal to oust the former PUCSL Chairman from his post. During that debate we heard what the Opposition MPs said. Some of our MPs have informed us that they need to have a further round of talks with the President over the appointment of Harsha de Silva. This journey has to be traversed based on understanding. If the Opposition is unwilling to attend discussions, then you could avoid it there is no issue over it. You are saying that we should work in unity. If that is the case then there should be an ideal environment created for it. If you are saying one thing here and then uttering something else outside then how could we work in consensus. Therefore I urge you to think about it and let us work in consensus and not with ulterior motives. Do not forget that the President is not from the SLPP. He is from a different party and he constantly reminds us of this.  Hence, I urge you all to join the talks with the President.  Chief Opposition Whip MP Lakshman Kiriella: “I too was part of yesterday’s discussion. The Chief Government Whip is insisting that Government MPs are opposed to this appointment. There is no such thing mentioned in the Standing Orders. Show me where it has been stipulated that certain appointments cannot be made due to objections of certain MPs. This is a misconception spread by this regime. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena: “We all agreed yesterday.” Kiriella: “The Chief Government Whip is talking about jungle law here”.  Ranatunga: “The Speaker, we yesterday deliberated at length regarding what has been mentioned in the Standing Orders. The Chief Opposition Whip who is talking about the so-called jungle law also agreed for it yesterday.” (GW)"

For within its walls her students not only learn about academics but also all the skills and attitudes one needs to lead a dignified life. Wesley College stands as a radiant beacon among the leading colleges in Colombo, for faithfully sustaining this blessed experience of a holistic education. It is an amazing school where the bonds of friendship exceed the perimeters of the classroom and remain for a lifetime. Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira goes down in history as the prudent academic who prayerfully established Wesley College. He thoughtfully gave the school a fitting motto ‘Ora et Labora’ – meaning pray and labour on. For when life’s challenges assail, prayer is a divine source of comfort and strength. We commemorate the memory of our Founder, with great reverence and gratitude, annually on Founder’s Day. No doubt the dedicated labour of Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira – a zealous servant of God – has accumulated a rich harvest of which we, in this present age, are beneficiaries. Wesley College will extend this blissful harvest for generations to come, moulding men of grit and integrity. The Methodist Church in Pettah is an iconic vintage. The building has been formally recognised by the Government of Sri Lanka as a protected archaeological monument as declared on 17 May 2013 by Government Gazette No. 1811. Within the once busy area of a developing Colombo city, the church met the spiritual needs of many, including foreign parishioners. The building complex comprised a chapel, a dwelling house for two families, a large schoolroom, printing and bookbinding offices, a type foundry and warehouses. It was in the schoolroom here, on 2 March 1874 that the first classes of Wesley College were held, blessed by divine providence and grace. Long before the end of the 19th century, the buildings at Dam Street were becoming inadequate for the purpose of a progressive educational institution. The numbers were swelling and more space was needed. Parents began talking about the Methodist Church school that was doing well in every sphere of education. Incidentally, the concept of School Cadets was started within Wesley for the first time in vintage Ceylon. Rev. Highfield earnestly began to look for a more spacious property in the precincts of Colombo. In 1902 a site of five and a half acres at Karlshrue on the west side of Baseline Road close to Campbell Park was duly acquired. Five years later, in February 1907, the new premises of Wesley College was declared open by the Governor of Ceylon Sir Henry and Lady Blake. Over the past century and a half, Wesley College has made tremendous progress in academics and sports. She has produced distinguished old boys, and among them are the famous five men who were knighted by Her Majesty The Queen. Today the college diligently continues her journey with renewed hope and relentless inspiration, to carry forward the goal of reaching greater heights. The college is supported by its local and international fraternity of faithful old boys’ associations, who work for the development of their alma mater. Wesley College is making many plans to celebrate its 150th anniversary in 2024."

The Pakistani Government has awarded these scholarships to Sri Lankan A/L students since 2006. So far, more than 2,400 Sri Lankan students have benefitted from this programme, named after Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the revered founding father of Pakistan. Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Vidura Wickramanayake was the chief guest. During his speech, the chief guest highly appreciated the gracious gesture from the people and the Government of Pakistan. He added that such efforts will be very fruitful in strengthening bilateral relations between the two-friendly countries.

He also informed the audience that the Government of Pakistan has been awarding the Jinnah Scholarship to bright Sri Lankan students since 2006. The High Commissioner mentioned that the students who qualified for this prestigious scholarship came from all provinces of the island. The ratio of Sinhalese, Tamil (67) and Muslim (74) students was also almost equal. It was very encouraging to see that the number of female students (87) was almost double as compared to that of the male students (44). Moreover, the Government of Pakistan takes pride in producing hundreds of doctors, engineers and other professionals in various faculties through separate fully-funded scholarship programmes.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

On the proposal submitted by Minister of Environment Naseer Ahamed, the international Mining and Mineral industry event is to take place in October this year. Speaking on the upcoming international event, Minister Ahamed said the prime objective of the event is to build a global brand value for the Sri Lankan mineral industry on a medium-term perspective by re-positioning Sri Lankan minerals, based on their unique value propositions (UVP) and thereby, to unlock the enormous investment and economic potential for the country. He said minerals are a gift of nature and export of minerals play a vital role in the foreign exchange earning of many developing nations. If a country can make the maximum out of its mineral resources, economic prosperity would be within reach. At a time when Sri Lanka is facing a severe foreign exchange deficit, the export of minerals and mineral-based value-added products becomes all the more important with its high potential to become the next ‘billion-dollar industry’ in Sri Lanka. The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Environment has identified and mapped out 43 mineral resources in Sri Lanka. Amongst them, Graphite, Heavy Mineral Sand, Limestone, Phosphate, Dimension Stones, Quartz Vein etc. have been identified as having the most intrinsic value with high export potential. Minister Ahamed further said as a result of the protective policies adopted in the past, Sri Lanka has not been successful in attracting genuine and world-class mineral and mining industry stakeholders. On the other hand, it has also led to manipulative and anti-competitive industry practices hampering the growth of the industry and depriving the country of many opportunities. Referring to the new economic vision promoted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister Ahamed stated that as mentioned in the recent Budget speech, the President has set targets of generating a further annual USD 3 billion of exports and USD 3 billion of FDI. Therefore, new export-generating sectors need to be initiated through FDI and the introduction of new technologies. Mineral processing could be such a new export diversification sector. It could also result in the development of Mineral-based Import Substitution industries and other associated industries creating many employment opportunities while saving foreign exchange for the country. Sri Lanka’s mineral and mining industry is a clear example of how the President is transforming his strategic economic vision into action by boosting the industry and harnessing both its ‘high-investment and high export’ potentials. Minister Ahamed expressed confidence that under the visionary leadership of the President the mineral and mining industry will soon go through a very transparent and accountable development transformation which will put an end to the unfortunate saga of Sri Lanka not being able to export value-added mineral products even though Lanka Mineral Sands Pvt. Ltd. was set up as far back as 1957. The Environment Minister also said the proposed International Industry event will flag the theme ‘Venturing into New Frontiers’. The multi-faceted event will capture a wide national and international audience that will provide new perspectives, share cutting-edge technology, knowledge and insights that will drive the national agenda on minerals and grow investor interest in this emerging industry, contributing immensely to the economic recovery of the country. Speaking on the proposed event, GSMB Chairman Ravi Sanjeepan said the proposed International Mining and Mineral Conference, Investor Forum and Exhibition will provide an ideal platform for all stakeholders of the present and future Mineral Industry in Sri Lanka to: • Address the present and future challenges faced in bringing advanced technologies from foreign countries; • Discuss private and foreign funding opportunities; • Evaluate different strategies for adopting and integrating of new technologies with existing technologies; • Study the upcoming technology developments in the extraction and exploration of minerals; • Find partners/ business matchmaking and local investment opportunities Sanjeepan also added that more than 20 globally renowned international mineral companies representing many countries have shown keen interest to explore investment opportunities in Sri Lanka and that the proposed event will bring all of them together in one platform to interact with policymakers and government officers enabling them to take their project concepts to the next level."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/05/25/full-citizenship-doesnt-mean-meaningful-citizenship-mosel/,Full citizenship doesn’t mean meaningful citizenship – Mosel,Author not found,0,2023-05-24T20:30:00+00:00," Deputy Mission Director of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Debra Mosel, said the Malayaga Tamils’ long, peaceful struggle for full citizenship finally paid off with the Government’s commendable action to grant them status a little more than a decade ago; however, full citizenship does not automatically translate into meaningful citizenship. Mosel made this statement expressing her admiration for the Malayaga Tamil community (Upcountry Tamils) during the commemoration of the 200th Anniversary of Hill Country Tamils recently. Marking the occasion, she said it gives both an opportunity to look back at the 200 years of the community’s journey and the opportunity to look forward, adding that if a segment of a society is one of the most economically, socially, and politically marginalised communities in a country, it’s impossible to say their citizenship – while full in the eyes of the State – fully rewards the Malayaga Tamils with the same benefits enjoyed by the rest of society. She pointed out that this community of Sri Lankans is now spread out in all parts of the island with a distinct political voice. This new generation asks not for sympathy, but for dignity and equality. The United States supports these aspirations and looks forward to them becoming a reality and the US will continue to support their journey. In her speech, she further emphasised that both women and men from this community have served as the backbone of Sri Lanka’s economy for over a century. Their significant contributions have not only shaped the identity of Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, but have also been widely acknowledged. Mosel further commended the Sri Lankan Government for recognising the importance of officially commemorating this anniversary, a heartening gesture indeed. She said, “Their journey over the 200 years has been full of challenges – enduring the harsh conditions of the early plantation era, being made stateless, losing the right to vote after independence – all have left indelible marks on the country’s history.” “The Malayaga Tamils have not only withstood the structural exclusion, discrimination, and frequent violence that visited them. They have persisted in building a community with a distinct identity rooted in the hills of this country. Over the last two centuries, their existence has been a struggle and their resilience a testament to their strength,” she added. The community lags behind national averages in most development indicators. For example, household income in the plantation sector in 2016 was just over half the national income level and more than 70 per cent of the population fell within the lowest rung of the poverty ladder. And while the community has made significant advances in some respects – producing men and women of eminence in the arts, sports, education, and business – there must be a way forward to ensure the value of citizenship.  There must be a model whereby gains made in one area through government action are not offset by reduced benefits elsewhere. Only then will living standards rise and will the community truly enjoy the benefits of full citizenship. She stressed by marking their 200 years in Sri Lanka, she is encouraged by the hope of their youth. “They are bold and assertive. Throughout our 75 years of bilateral relations with Sri Lanka, the US Government has supported many interventions to improve the living standards of the Malayaga Tamils. USAID works with civil society and the private sector through three activities. Including our support to the Institute of Social Development, we’re advancing democratic values of citizen participation and also driving local economic development through tourism,” she underlined. “I am confident that with continued development support the community will contribute more than its fair share in the recovery of Sri Lanka from the present economic crisis and assert its place as full and equal citizens of Sri Lanka.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Ambassador made a presentation at the Conference titled ‘Sri Lanka’s Biodiversity: its contribution to humanity’. She said Sri Lanka was the first country in the world to have a policy, guidelines and an action plan on mangrove conservation. Sri Lanka’s expertise and experiences are being widely shared globally, particularly through the Commonwealth Blue Charter, of which Sri Lanka leads the Action Group on Mangrove Ecosystems and Livelihoods. The important role of mangroves in controlling salinity intrusion was explained with an example of a rice cultivation, which needs fresh water, within about 20 feet away from the mangroves growing in the saline water filled Komari Lagoon in the Eastern Province in Sri Lanka.  Ankara University organised a Conference to commemorate International Biodiversity Day where the Ambassador was invited as a keynote speaker at the event. The Ankara University, established in 1946, with its 19 faculties, is one of the oldest universities in Türkiye to establish a faculty of Agriculture in 1948, absorbing the Higher Institute of Agriculture. The Ambassador was welcomed by the Rector of Ankara University, Prof. Dr. Necdet Ünüvar, and Coordinator for Environmental Planning and Management of Ankara University, Prof. Dr. Ahmet Emre Yaprak. Ambassador and the Rector exchanged views on developing bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Türkiye and possible mutual cooperation between University of Ankara and Sri Lankan universities by connecting professionals, experts, staff and students in the field of biodiversity and agriculture. Ambassador also congratulated Türkiye for undertaking to host the 16th Conference of Parties of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in 2024. A copy of a publication on “Biodiversity of Ankara University” was gifted to the Ambassador. She described the factors that threatened biodiversity in Sri Lanka, current status of conservation together with national policies and strategic plans in place. She also described the relevant government agencies engaged in conservation and protection with inter-agency coordination mechanisms and how those agencies collaborate with the academia and experts, role of private sector and NGOs. Role played by the Blue Carbon Ecosystems with Sri Lanka’s mangroves, seagrass beds, salt marshes in carbon sequestration was highlighted as a key factor in contributing positively to mitigate climate change impact. The biodiversity of Sri Lanka also provides immense opportunities for food security and for research and development of new pharmaceutical products, in addition to its contribution to the country’s Ayurvedic healthcare traditions, with far reaching global benefits. Biodiversity is also intertwined with the tourism and fisheries sectors and supports local livelihoods. Ambassador Dissanayake further elaborated on the Sri Lankan culture with majority of people following religions promoting non-violence and to be compassionate, not only towards human beings but also towards the nature. These cultural traditions, over the centuries, contributed to understanding the value of the protection of nature and human coexistence with flora and fauna. Ambassador Dissanayake also indicated the key initiatives and measures taken by Sri Lanka to protect and conserve its biodiversity such as establishing protected areas, wildlife conservation, species conservation, and forest conservation and marine conservation. Environmental education and awareness, is an aspect that the country has been focusing much. As a result, environment and climate change issues are now being included in the school curriculum in Sri Lanka as that is the only way to ensure that consciousness on the need to protect our environment, including the biodiversity is inculcated in the minds of people. Further, Sri Lanka is in the process of setting up world’s first ever university dedicated to climate change, with Sri Lanka’s President having announced it at the 27th Conference of Parties of the United Nations Conference on Climate Change held in held from 6 -20 November 2022 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The President acknowledged that although climate change is a significant challenge for the world, there is no central research hub to study it, and invited multiple countries to join Sri Lanka in the effort. Among other speakers were Rector of Ankara University – Prof. Ünüvar, the Coordinator for Environmental Planning and Management of Ankara University – Prof. Yaprak, Emeritus Professor of Gazi University – Prof. Dr. Mecit Vural and Professor at the Agriculture Faculty of the Ankara University – Prof. Dr. Oğuz Can Turgay.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Addressing the media at the Health Promotion Bureau, Dr. Abeyjeewa yesterday (24) said victims with spinal cord injuries could suffer a great deal more if they were not transferred following a proper methodology. Three-wheelers usually come forward to assist at times like these but they are only meant to transport passengers in a sitting position and cannot accommodate victims suspected of e sustaining spinal injuries during accidents.    A majority of these patients remained hospitalised at the NHSL, Colombo for three months or more receiving treatment. This was not only a disadvantage from the patient’s side but was difficult for the hospital due to the expenditure incurred and other related difficulties.  He said people could sustain spinal injuries during a fall from a height, in road traffic accident and violence, if a person falls from a one-metre height, or meets with an accident even while driving at 40 miles per hour–especially if they are not wearing seat belts or there were no air bags in the car, or in a roll-over accident or if a person was thrown out of the vehicle during the collision. Motorcyclists were highly vulnerable to spinal injuries during accidents, he said. Dr. Abeyjeewa said accident victims who complain of pain in the neck area or numbness of the arms and legs showed signs of spinal cord injuries. Another symptom of spinal injury would be if the victim complained that he or she could not lift her legs as they felt too heavy. Such patients should be transferred to the hospital with great care, he said. A majority of accident victims are transported to hospital in three-wheelers where there is hardly any space for a patient to be taken to an accident service, it is better if the victim could be either transferred in the back of a lorry or at least using a wooden board, he said. But the best way to transfer a patient with spinal injury would be to call for an ambulance. By Dilanthi Jayamanne        "

This development was disclosed during the 15th Annual National Conference on Cyber Security 2023, organised by the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT). The ministry emphasised that the Cyber Security Act, which is part of the National Information and Cyber Security Strategic Plan, is expected to be presented to Parliament this year. Once enacted, the Cyber Security Act aims to safeguard the privacy of citizens from the detrimental effects of digitalisation, as well as protect the data of both public and private institutions and websites. The conference, held on the theme ‘Protecting Critical National Information Infrastructure,’ witnessed the participation of numerous IT experts and professionals. During the event, the Information and Cyber Security Policy Statement was released, and the first publication was presented to State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath by the CERT Chairman. The State Minister said, “Our Information Security Act has already been adopted by Parliament. Therefore, this year, we will focus on establishing the Cyber Security Authority. The Cyber Security Act has already been translated.” The purpose of the Cyber Security Act is to ensure the security of individual and organisational data in both public and commercial sectors, including website security. It is worth noting that social media censorship will not be implemented without the enactment of this Act, which is of interest to many social media users. “The implementation of this Act will allow us to protect our country from cyber attacks, as well as mitigate personal risks and challenges. In our nation, we have tragically witnessed the loss of children’s lives due to certain social media activities. The Act will enable us to safeguard against such incidents. It is crucial to utilise social media in a manner that does not harm individuals, and this Act provides the necessary framework for achieving that. Without this Act, there will be no censorship imposed on social media platforms,” Herath pointed out. "

Dr. de Silva highlighted the critical considerations surrounding Domestic Debt Optimisation and its impact on the members of the EPF. He emphasised the need to prioritise the interests of EPF pension fund members in any decision-making process.  “Our foremost concern should be securing the retirement benefits of the hardworking people of Sri Lanka. The EPF, as a pension fund, plays a crucial role in ensuring a financially secure future for its members upon retirement. We cannot allow the government’s pursuit of cheap money to jeopardise the interests of EPF pensioners,” he said.  Referring to the EPF Act, Dr. de Silva underscored the obligation for a parliamentary resolution to ensure the EPF receives sufficient funds from the Treasury to meet minimum payment requirements if it is unable to do so. He further emphasised the importance of gradually settling any resulting loans over time. “We must protect the EPF pension fund from being subjugated to the government’s needs at the expense of pensioners. The negative 47 per cent real return to EPF in 2022 has severely eroded the value of the fund, and we cannot disregard this significant loss,” he added.  Discussing the risks associated with domestic debt optimisation, he highlighted the concept of opportunity cost. “Subjecting the EPF pension fund to this optimisation may result in a loss of potential reinvestment opportunities,” he explained. “For instance, if the EPF currently holds bonds maturing within the next one or two years, they have the potential to be reinvested at higher rates, ensuring better returns for pensioners. However, if these bonds’ maturity dates are extended beyond 2027 at lower rates that will have a high opportunity cost to EPF members,” de Silva stated.  Clarifying the EPF pension fund’s overall financial position, de Silva reassured the public that the EPF is not facing immediate trouble. “The EPF pension fund maintains a positive cash flow, with contributions consistently exceeding pension payouts by approximately 30 billion rupees in recent years. This ensures the EPF’s ability to meet its pension obligations. However, we must acknowledge that returns on investments may decrease,” he added. He also noted that cconsidering the negative real interest rate the EPF pension fund has already experienced, it is unjust to overburden it further with large opportunity costs due to domestic debt optimisation. “We must prioritise the interests of EPF members and strike a balance between preserving reasonable returns to the members while providing debt relief to the government,” he added. Concluding his remarks, de Silva firmly stated that the long-term financial security of Sri Lanka’s workforce cannot be jeopardised. (NV)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Cabinet approved a proposal to amend Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 743/5 dated 1 December 1992. Earlier, the Grama Niladhari division was referred to as ‘Kompannavidiya’ in Sinhala, ‘Kompanitteru’ in Tamil, and ‘Slave Island’ in English. Recognising the importance of linguistic harmony and inclusivity, the decision to establish a common name for the Grama Niladhari Division was made to foster unity among the diverse communities residing in the area. By having consistent names in all three languages, the Government seeks to promote mutual understanding and cultural respect. The division previously referred to by different names in each language, often led to confusion and miscommunication among residents, visitors, and administrative authorities. Therefore, to streamline administrative processes and eliminate discrepancies arising from language disparities, the Prime Minister, who also holds the portfolio of Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government, presented the proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers, which was subsequently approved. This decision will require amending the existing Gazette Notification, which will be replaced by a new one announcing the name as ‘Kompannavidiya’ in all three languages.

Assistant Commissioner of Local Government J.M. Ameen said these service centres are run by the Dimbulagala Pradeshiya Sabha. “The PS has brought 50 kg of chlorine sacks. Although it is printed as expiring on 1 January 2022, the PHIs have claimed the chlorine has been mixed to the relevant water tanks by covering the true expiry date with a sticker pasted stating its expiry in 2026 and 2027. Although the authorities said the company that supplied the chlorine will be prosecuted, they have not yet taken steps to remove the chlorine in use,” Ameen said. “When I went to Siripura People’s Consumer Service Centre yesterday (23) to inquire about this, it was stated that 500 g of chlorine had been used in those tanks yesterday as well,” he said. The PHIs of the area have been using loudspeakers to announce that the water provided by the respective water service centres is not suitable for consumption as excrement was mixing with it since last January, but the people are still drinking this water because they do not have other sources, he stressed. Several PHIs said although the relevant authorities of the Dimbulagala PS have been informed about this, it has not stopped yet. It has been confirmed that the water is not suitable for drinking, they said. Meanwhile, SLPP Polonnaruwa District MP and Chairman of the District Development Committee Jagath Samarawickrama visited the Dimbulagala and Weheragala water service centres.

As SLN arrived on the scene, the regional stakeholders had already commenced extensive aeronautical search and surface search in the area of the overturned Chinese fishing vessel. Having reached the location, Navy divers meticulously searched for air pockets within the upturned vessel, hoping to find any survivors. After strenuous diving amidst the challenges of zero visibility and enormous water turbulence, the Navy divers recovered two bodies from the captain’s cabin and accommodation area and they were handed over to the tug De Tian on scene. In addition, the Navy divers recovered 12 more bodies of the crew from various compartments of the vessel. Due to decomposition and the potential health hazards posed by operating in contaminated waters with limited protective gear, it was determined that retrieving those bodies would be exceedingly dangerous. Next, the decision was made to map the locations of the bodies, while prioritising the safety of the SLN divers. Subsequently, the Diving Officer and Navy divers attached to SLNS Vijayabahu embarked on MV SHANDONG DE LONG which arrived there with a Chinese salvage team and gave them a comprehensive briefing on the mapped locations of bodies, safe passages for divers to enter and exit the overturned vessel as well as the onward action, yesterday (23).    On completion of its intended task, SLNS Vijayabahu concluded its SAR operation and commenced the return journey on 22 May.

Accordingly, the welfare benefits will be directly credited to the beneficiary’s bank account. This was revealed by Welfare Benefits Board Chairman B. Wijayaratne during the “101 Katha” programme produced by the President’s Media Division (PMD). Wijayaratne said this encompasses the correction of any previous errors in social welfare benefits and the continuation of existing government assistance programmes such as Samurdhi and Elderly Assistance. The Welfare Benefits Board has taken the necessary steps to facilitate the opening of bank accounts for those who lack one. He said the selection of beneficiaries is carried out through a centralised database, ensuring that political affiliations do not influence the assistance provided. The ‘Aswesuma’ welfare benefits programme, initiated by the President as part of the social safety net to alleviate the effects of the ongoing economic crisis, is under the purview of State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe, with involvement from various Government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance. Wijayaratne said this while participating in the ‘101 Katha’ programme produced by the PMD. Through this programme, financial assistance will be provided to lower-income groups, comprising 40 per cent of society, across four categories. The Government aims to offer Rs 15,000 per month to families falling under the extremely poor category, he said. He further said with the implementation of the ‘Aswesuma’ welfare benefits programme starting in July, there is a possibility that individuals who have been receiving benefits such as Samurdhi may lose them. This could be due to factors such as having a stable income or not applying for ‘Aswesuma’ welfare benefits. Individuals who believe they should be eligible for benefits but are not included in the initial list can submit their appeals. As soon as the list of eligible recipients is published, they can either file an appeal or submit applications during the second phase, commencing after July. The Chairman acknowledged allegations that some financially vulnerable individuals were overlooked in the existing welfare benefits programmes and that certain beneficiaries, including Samurdhi recipients, were included based on political influence. In response to these concerns and to address the allegations and provide support to those in need, President Ranil Wickremesinghe intervened and launched the ‘Aswesuma’ welfare benefits scheme. Beginning in August, the Welfare Benefits Board invited applications, receiving submissions from over 3.7 million people. Data regarding income and expenses were collected through the ‘Aswesuma’ mobile app, with additional verification conducted by a dedicated committee at the Divisional Secretariat level. The finalised list of eligible individuals for ‘Aswesuma’ welfare benefits will be made available at each Grama Niladhari office and on the Welfare Benefits Board’s official website (https://www.wbb.gov.lk/). If an applicant’s name is not included in the list or if there is someone included who is deemed ineligible for assistance, individuals have the option to file an appeal. The scheme aims to ensure that no deserving individual is left behind, emphasising inclusivity and fairness. Additionally, for those unable to submit applications during the initial phase, there will be an opportunity to do so during the second phase, after July. Further details regarding this will be communicated through newspapers and media channels. "

Addressing the media, Minister Alles said the necessary legal action will be taken against the three persons, who were caught at BIA with forged passports, following an inquiry with the assistance of the Chinese Embassy and relevant departments. The minister said that following the incident, he inquired from the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration about the incident and it was clear that something has went wrong in this particular incident. “A Chinese national cannot have two passports. But this Chinese person in question has another passport. I cannot exactly say whether a State Minister intervened in releasing him from immigration custody. It seems that since he had a Chinese passport, he was allowed to enter the country,” he said. The Minister said the approval to enter the country was cancelled and officials were instructed to summon him to the Department of Immigration and Emigration. Further action would be taken in consultation of the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka, the Minister said. Speaking further, he said, “As public representatives we receive many requests for help. Every citizen can speak to the officials to seek assistance. However, the officials have to be careful about how they entertain such requests.” Allegations have been made claiming that due to State Minister of Urban Development and Housing Arundika Fernando’s intervention, the Immigration and Emigration officials at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), had been forced to release the three foreign nationals; two Chinese passengers and an Egyptian, who were detained to be deported for attempting to enter the country using forged passports and for unruly behaviour at the airport. The Chinese passenger, using a forged passport, along with his companions, attempted to enter the country. However, their plans were foiled when Immigration and Emigration officers detected the forgery and prevented their entry. The unruly behaviour exhibited by the group, upon their deception being discovered resulted in their detention and subsequent plans for deportation. It is reported that despite their initial detention, the trio was later released, allegedly on the instructions of the State Minister. Upon further investigation, it was uncovered that the Chinese passenger, along with his two associates, had arrived in Sri Lanka from Dubai last Thursday (18). The Chinese passenger had presented a Guinean passport, which the authorities swiftly determined to be forged. By Dinithi Wijesundara"

In a letter addressed to the IGP, Chandrakirthi emphasised the urgency of conducting a thorough inquiry into those responsible for disseminating misleading information about the labour law reforms. The letter highlighted that while a public consultation process had been initiated to gather feedback and suggestions on the labour law reforms, the actual drafting of the new legal framework had not yet commenced, taking into account the opinions received. The article further revealed that false information was being circulated, through social media platforms, claiming that the new labour laws had already been finalised and suggesting potential adverse effects on labour rights. Such misinformation campaigns were raising concerns about the possibility of generating distrust and discontent towards the Department of Labour among workers and trade unions, potentially leading to labour unrest. Consequently, Chandrakirthi urgently requested the IGP to conduct a prompt investigation into the individuals responsible for spreading this false propaganda via social media. In the meantime, Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara commented on the matter, noting that certain parties were using labour laws as scapegoats for their personal benefit. He emphasised that organisations would be obligated to contribute to the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF) even if they employed just a single worker, as part of the proposed labour law reforms. Nanayakkara expressed the government’s commitment to providing insurance, protection, and social security to all private sector employees, similar to the benefits enjoyed by government employees through the ‘Agrahara’ insurance scheme.

AHP President, Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (22)  said that patients on the list to undergo Angiograms were faced with the trepidation as a result as their bypass surgeries and stenting procedures were all shelved until January 2024. Those on the list for Catheterisation would have to wait till next year to have the decisive procedure performed. Those with 80% blocks in their valves are directed for bypass surgery. However, all such procedures have been shelved for the timebeing, he said. “As a result, a date for their bypass surgery may be available in two years,” he lamented noting that for these two months alone, about 1,000 tests had been added to the Cath-lab queue. If the patients were still alive by then no one will even look into what the test procedure is for,” Kumudesh warned. The AHP President, lambasting the Health Ministry, accused it of lacking enthusiasm to solve these simple issues, so that patients in the State health service don’t have to languish or have to hang between life and death until the Ministry decided to do its duty by them. On the other hand the radiation treatment for cancer patients has been temporarily stopped with the two linear accelerator machines in the Cancer Unit of National Hospital, Kandy not being in a working condition. It has not been possible to upgrade their coolers for the past six months, he said. None of these issues are due to the economic crisis. Neither are they caused by floods or earthquakes. They are simple administrative problems. There is no place in the Health Ministry to discuss these issues while if one wants to meet the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) one has to obtain a visa to another country as on majority occasions he is travelling overseas. Deputy Director General NHSL Dr. Kumara Wickremasinghe, when contacted, said his hospital had three Cath labs while only one of them was currently shut down for maintenance. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The country is targeting half a million Chinese tourists in 2024, nearly double its pre-Covid visitor levels, Fernando said at a press briefing in Beijing yesterday (22).  If each Chinese tourist spent USD 5,000 that could raise a figure comparable to the recent International Monetary Fund bailout, he said. “If you really look at it, tourism can get Sri Lanka out of this mess,” the minister added. Sri Lanka clinched a three billion USD bailout loan from the IMF in March after six months of negotiations. It is still trying to reach a debt restructuring agreement that would help the release of the next round of funds. China has been an observer to those talks. Paris Club members account for USD 4.8 billion, or more than 10% of Sri Lanka’s external debt, according to IMF data. That’s slightly higher than China, which stands at USD 4.5 billion, while India is owed USD 1.8 billion. Palitha Kohona, Sri Lanka’s ambassador to China, who was also at the event in Beijing, said bilateral debt talks were on-going.  Fernando said he’d presented a plan to Sri Lanka’s government that included free tourist visas for Chinese travellers until November. “They can just walk into Sri Lanka with a Chinese passport,” he said.  The minister also said he was holding talks with Chinese carriers, including China Southern Airlines and Air China, asking them to increase the number of flights to Sri Lanka. This month, carriers are operating 92 flights between the two countries, down from 174 in the same month of 2019, according to flight data provider Cirium. Sri Lanka has battled its worst economic problems since independence in recent years, after protests over soaring inflation, food shortages and lengthy power cuts toppled the government. A series of deadly terror blasts in 2019 also hit tourism arrivals, along with the subsequent Covid pandemic.  Before all that, Sri Lanka saw some 266,000 Chinese arrivals in 2018, according to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. That fell sharply to 167,863 the following year, according to the authority.   The return of Chinese tourists is considered essential to the rebound of global tourism, but outbound travel is still lagging pre-pandemic levels. More than half of Chinese travellers said they hadn’t set plans to go abroad this year in a survey published last month. (Bloomberg)"

Under the audit, eight critical areas such as the regulatory framework of the national aviation security system, training of aviation security personnel, quality control functions, airport operations, passenger and baggage security, etc., and several others were audited impartially by a four-member expert audit team. During the audit process carried out at BIA over a period of 11 days of scrutiny on the aviation security systems revealed that Sri Lanka is flying high in its performance. The AASL as the civil airport operator and the aviation services provider has been able to meet the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) requirements for the aviation security systems at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) and other airports reassuring that Sri Lanka’s airports and skies are safe. At the concluding event, the post-audit debriefing by the ICAO audit team leader, Aurelien Lavayssiere presented the interim report and declared that Sri Lanka has achieved 92% of the score. In the previous audit carried out in the year 2012, the score achieved was 85.6%. Therefore, as the operator of civil airports in Sri Lanka, AASL recognises this as a great achievement to score 92% this time because of the hard work and commitment of aviation security, airport management, other related institutions and all other agencies. Major Gen. (Rtd.) G.A. Chandrasiri, Chairman-AASL stated, “This certification at a time when the passenger movements at its main gateway, Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), recorded a growth of 20% in the first quarter of 2023, compared with 2022 and facilitating over 18,000 passenger movements and 120 aircraft movements daily, will boost the confidence among the international airlines and Sri Lanka’s aviation industry for better prospects.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Addressing the media, Minister Alles said the necessary legal action will be taken against the three persons, who were caught at BIA with forged passports, following an inquiry with the assistance of the Chinese Embassy and relevant departments. The minister said that following the incident, he inquired from the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration about the incident and it was clear that something has went wrong in this particular incident. “A Chinese national cannot have two passports. But this Chinese person in question has another passport. I cannot exactly say whether a State Minister intervened in releasing him from immigration custody. It seems that since he had a Chinese passport, he was allowed to enter the country,” he said. The Minister said the approval to enter the country was cancelled and officials were instructed to summon him to the Department of Immigration and Emigration. Further action would be taken in consultation of the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka, the Minister said. Speaking further, he said, “As public representatives we receive many requests for help. Every citizen can speak to the officials to seek assistance. However, the officials have to be careful about how they entertain such requests.” Allegations have been made claiming that due to State Minister of Urban Development and Housing Arundika Fernando’s intervention, the Immigration and Emigration officials at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), had been forced to release the three foreign nationals; two Chinese passengers and an Egyptian, who were detained to be deported for attempting to enter the country using forged passports and for unruly behaviour at the airport. The Chinese passenger, using a forged passport, along with his companions, attempted to enter the country. However, their plans were foiled when Immigration and Emigration officers detected the forgery and prevented their entry. The unruly behaviour exhibited by the group, upon their deception being discovered resulted in their detention and subsequent plans for deportation. It is reported that despite their initial detention, the trio was later released, allegedly on the instructions of the State Minister. Upon further investigation, it was uncovered that the Chinese passenger, along with his two associates, had arrived in Sri Lanka from Dubai last Thursday (18). The Chinese passenger had presented a Guinean passport, which the authorities swiftly determined to be forged. By Dinithi Wijesundara"

In a letter addressed to the IGP, Chandrakirthi emphasised the urgency of conducting a thorough inquiry into those responsible for disseminating misleading information about the labour law reforms. The letter highlighted that while a public consultation process had been initiated to gather feedback and suggestions on the labour law reforms, the actual drafting of the new legal framework had not yet commenced, taking into account the opinions received. The article further revealed that false information was being circulated, through social media platforms, claiming that the new labour laws had already been finalised and suggesting potential adverse effects on labour rights. Such misinformation campaigns were raising concerns about the possibility of generating distrust and discontent towards the Department of Labour among workers and trade unions, potentially leading to labour unrest. Consequently, Chandrakirthi urgently requested the IGP to conduct a prompt investigation into the individuals responsible for spreading this false propaganda via social media. In the meantime, Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara commented on the matter, noting that certain parties were using labour laws as scapegoats for their personal benefit. He emphasised that organisations would be obligated to contribute to the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF) even if they employed just a single worker, as part of the proposed labour law reforms. Nanayakkara expressed the government’s commitment to providing insurance, protection, and social security to all private sector employees, similar to the benefits enjoyed by government employees through the ‘Agrahara’ insurance scheme. He also reassured that appointments to the Labour Consultative Council were made in accordance with established legal procedures. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

I did not have any personal relationship with the concerned investor and asked him to provide the necessary support without inconveniencing him.

He mentioned this in a discussion regarding the problems faced by the cooperative societies in the Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara Districts of the Western Province and on providing prompt solutions to those issues held at Temple Trees on 22.05.2023.  The Prime Minister informed the Western Province Governor as well as the relevant officials that when there is an economic crisis in the country, the government officials should act accordingly to find remedies and the preliminary draft to change the cooperative charter in the Western Province, which is not strong enough. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena pointed out that the cooperative movement does a great service to provide relief to the public in times of crisis in the country. In his speech Prime Minister declared that: “The property belonging to Cooperatives are built over a long period of time and some of them are donations from various people. I know very well about the property of the Society in Hewagam Korale East. It is true that everything should be done according to the law. Yet, is it fair to deprive these Cooperatives of their property without trying any means to recover the failed system? “On the other hand, a system is needed to appoint those who have expertise in the field irrespective of the fact that they are Government officers or not, to the committee until the co-operative society elections are held. Similarly, if a person has been accused by the Board of Directors for some reason and being released from it, that person has no possibility to become a member of the co-operative society again. There is no place to submit an appeal. It is a violation of fundamental rights. This situation has arisen due to the weakness of the Western Province Cooperative Charter. In this way, the cooperative movement will not continue. Now if these issues are referred to the Parliamentary Petitions Committee, decisions will have to be taken not only against the petitioner, but also against the officials who committed injustice. And I request you to advise the legal officer in the Provincial Council to contact the Attorney General and seek prompt and practical answers to these legal questions”. Member of Parliament Rohitha Abeygunawardena also spoke on the occasion and said that in addition to the investigation under the Cooperative Department, an urgent investigation should be conducted through the Criminal Investigation Department to prevent the destruction of valuable property.

After being detained for three days in Vavuniya, Sivaruban had been taken to the TID offices in Colombo for interrogation, while two Sinhala and Tamil journalists from the North, who had written about him, had also been summoned to Colombo for questioning.

In light of this, a Level 01 (Yellow) warning has been issued for the following Divisional Secretariat Divisions and their surrounding areas: Baddegama, Elpitiya, Nagoda, and Yakkalamulla. This warning is valid for a period of 24 hours until 08.00 a.m. today (22). In response to this warning, the NBRO strongly advises residents residing in these landslide-prone areas to exercise heightened caution and remain prepared to evacuate swiftly to safe locations should heavy rainfall persist. Meanwhile, in light of the prevailing adverse weather conditions in Sri Lanka, the Expressway Traffic Police Division has issued an important advisory for motorists utilising the expressways. Drivers are urged to observe a maximum speed limit of 60 kmph to ensure their safety and the safety of others on the road. Furthermore, the Police emphasised the significance of maintaining a proper distance between vehicles while driving under these circumstances. This precautionary measure aims to prevent accidents and allow for ample reaction time. Additionally, motorists are advised to keep their front and rear lights turned on throughout their journey due to the reduced visibility caused by low light conditions. By adhering to these guidelines, drivers can contribute to safer road conditions and minimise the risks associated with adverse weather situations, the Police said."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/05/19/electricity-tariff-should-be-reduced-by-at-least-27-pucsl-chairman/,Electricity tariff should be reduced by at least 27% – PUCSL Chairman,Author not found,0,2023-05-18T20:50:00+00:00," The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has submitted a proposal to reduce the tariff by only 3 per cent, concealing the correct cost data, which is unacceptable, stressed Janaka Ratnayake, Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission ofSri Lanka (PUCSL), Addressing the media yesterday (18), he said there is a possibility of reducing electricity tariff by 27 per cent. Ratnayake, who has been confronting the Ministry of Power and Energy over the tariff hike and faces a possible exit, if Parliament votes against him, told the reporters that the CEB has been instructed to submit corrected data in order to reduce the electricity tariff in line with actual cost reductions. “The electricity tariff was increased by 66 per cent in February this year based on fake data showing a pie chart, he explained. He said, at that time, the tariff should have been increased by only 35 per cent.” He further said, “In the last tariff revision, we pointed out that the electricity demand of 16,550 GW estimated by the CEB was incorrect. Our estimate was that electricity demand this year would be limited to 15,050 GWh. In April, the CEB realised that our estimate was correct and that their demand was overestimated. Accordingly, they informed in writing that the estimated demand for the coming period of the year is 15,264 GWh.” Ratnayake also points out that if electricity tariffs were set and implemented according to his estimates, the situation electricity consumers are facing today would not have arisen. “Compared to the decrease in electricity demand, the cost of providing electricity should also decrease. The CEB initially estimated expenditure of Rs 392 billion for the period of July to December 2023. But the CEB now says that Rs 285 billion will be spent for the next six months. According to our calculation, the actual cost of electricity supply will be reduced by Rs 107 billion,” he said. If that is the case, the electricity tariff should be reduced by at least 27 per cent as a whole for the upcoming period. Otherwise, reducing tariffs by three per cent only for a limited number of customer groups, based on fake data, will not do justice to all electricity consumers. Also, the CEB would not get the expected income, he claimed. In a revision of electricity tariffs, all the proposals should be submitted in accordance with the tariff methodology (equation) approved under the Sri Lanka Electricity Act. According to methodology, only the reasonable cost of supplying electricity can be charged from the electricity consumer. Ratnayake pointed out that contrary to the approved method, CEB is trying to implement the tariff revision proposal even this time, by including proposals to recover the loans received by CEB, from the electricity consumers. “According to the tariff methodology, all data should be submitted correctly. Only approved costs recoverable from the customer can be included in the total cost. But this proposal has not been submitted with the data approved under tariff methodology.In calculating charges based on cost, the charges should be adjusted in such a way as to recover the actual and minimum costs. Calculating electricity charges based on high costs is against the Electricity Act. The CEB has been informed to share the corrected data,” he stressed.  “When the cost of fuel and electricity is high, it has an impact on industrialists as well as the common consumer. Fuel demand fell as a result of higher fuel prices. Due to increasing electricity prices, demand for electricity has declined. Energy ought to be made available at a cost that will benefit the economy as a whole. Prices need to be reduced right away and fairly. The cost of fuel has decreased in the global market. Compared to the previous year, the exchange rate is better. Given the market developments and the opportunity to help people, energy costs should be lowered in accordance with their actual cost,” said Ratnayake. After submitting the necessary information related to the tariff revision proposal, presented by the CEB, we have planned to hold a public consultation on the electricity tariff revision proposal and take the final decision based on the opinions of the people, he added.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The report was launched by the organisation, Sex Workers & Allies South Asia, at the Ecumenical Institute for Study and Dialog in Colombo on Tuesday (16). According to the report, a small number who did apply were denied Samurdhi, while 56 per cent stated it was because they did not perform sexual favours for the officials. Many sex workers, both women and transgender who were present at the report launch yesterday, spoke about the hardship they face and asked the Government and relevant authorities to help them overcome their daily plight and live in dignity. Some of the sex workers claimed they don’t have voting rights, since they don’t have the relevant documents for it. “When they contact appropriate offices and Grama Niladhari officers to issue letters or to register them, most of the time they are asked for sexual bribes.”  Most sex workers do not live in their hometown, but leave due to family pressure, losing their franchise to vote. They pointed out that reregistering elsewhere has been difficult for them because they are pushed from pillar to post because they are sex workers and transgenders. The practice of sexual bribery is normalised by different State officials, including Police to Samurdhi officers. Further, it says that 25 per cent were denied Samurdhi as they did not have access to a permanent address while 15 per cent said they did not have other requisite documentation. Also, three per cent were denied it as they did not have a marriage certificate either, because they chose to not get married or had not registered their marriage. The report also noted that nearly 50 per cent of the workers, who were arrested, especially under the Vagrancy Ordinance, were forced, intimidated or manipulated into pleading guilty by either the law enforcement authorities or their lawyer. In this, the Judges are complicit in this illegal practice as they are aware it happens and do not take any action, the report stated further. As a result of this common practice, 85 per cent of those arrested have said that they have always pleaded guilty. Due to this practice, a significant number of sex workers have criminal records which have an impact on future employment, including working overseas as migrant labour. One of the recommendations that were made by the expert panel was that the State must enable broad-based awareness programmes within the Sri Lanka Police force, beginning with the Police training colleges and extending across to the active Police force at local and national levels. Such programmes must involve dispelling prevalent harmful and judgmental ideas about sex work and go beyond viewing sex workers only as vectors of disease. It is this construct that justifies social stigma and the resultant dehumanising of sex workers through violence and discrimination. Such programmes must include civil society organisations who work with sex workers within a human rights framework, as well as the sex worker leadership of the emerging movement for sex workers’ rights in Sri Lanka. This approach will help the Police to begin viewing sex workers as human beings who deserve to live with fundamental rights and dignity and thereby access services, including those offered by the Sri Lanka Women and Children’s Desk, without fear of discrimination. Sri Lanka Police must immediately issue a circular with guidelines that address discrimination and violence faced by sex workers at the hands of law enforcement, the report recommended. The report that was prepared by the Sex Workers and Allies South Asia-Sri Lanka Chapter Supported by Social Scientists Association Sri Lanka. The authors of the report are Paba Deshapriya and Dr. Ponni Arasu. The Research was conducted by Peer researchers who are sex workers, who we are unable to acknowledge by name due to the prevailing situation of lack of respect, dignity and safety for sex workers in Sri Lanka.   By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Udugampola made this disclosure, while giving evidence on behalf of the Defence. He further informed the Court that former DIG Balasuriya, had even provided him written instructions, on how the probe should be carried out regarding the raid on the Safe House, as well as on how to protect the army intelligence officers, who had been taken into custody. President’s Counsel Saliya Peiris led evidence on behalf of the Defence. The witness also added that former DIG Balasuriya had advised him to video and photograph all military equipment and weapons that had been seized from the possession of the Army Intelligence officers, during the raid on the Safe House and to safeguard them. Later, Judge Patabendge deferred further hearing of evidence for the Defence, to 5 June.   The Attorney General has charged the accused before the High Court, of revealing State secrets, imperilling national security and infringing the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country, over the unlawful arrest of Army Intelligence officers and illegal seizing of their weapons, from a safe house situated at Millennium City Housing Complex, Athurugiriya, on 2 January 21 years ago.

He expressed confidence, during a meeting with Ministry Secretaries and Provincial Chief Secretaries, and noted that the proper implementation of the government’s policy programme would lead to economic prosperity surpassing the goals set by the International Monetary Fund. He stressed the need for a collective effort to address the concerns raised by the youth regarding the country’s economy and their future. The President emphasised the importance of restructuring State-owned companies to ensure a prosperous economy and urged ministry secretaries to support the government’s policy programme rather than protecting companies under their jurisdictions. The President also highlighted the forthcoming regulations on capital expenditure and projects of Provincial Councils, with decisions on power distribution at the local level expected within the next few months. The meeting covered the progress of budget proposals, the performance of ministry secretaries, and discussions on public enterprise reconciliation, public service management, and the economy. “Detailed deliberations were held on law amendments related to policy changes in the interim budget and the 2023 budget presented in Parliament, as well as Bills associated with obligations to the Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. Following is the full context of the President’s speech: “As the President, I acknowledge that every ministry shares responsibility for the economic bankruptcy our country faces today. With the proper implementation of our current program, we have the potential to surpass the goals set by the International Monetary Fund and achieve remarkable progress. One of our key objectives is the restructuring of public corporations, particularly the main company that oversees them. We will carefully assess these entities and retain some under government control, while allowing private companies to acquire the remaining shares. It is crucial that we receive maximum support in this endeavour to ensure the effective restructuring of these companies.” He said they must also introduce new regulations concerning capital expenditure and capital projects of the Provincial Councils. “Simultaneously, decisions pertaining to devolving power at the grassroots level must be expedited within the coming months. Let us swiftly address these matters. In terms of education, our initial plan was to grant authority to the Provincial Councils. However, circumstances have unfolded differently. Similarly, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Provincial Council share responsibilities in the agricultural sector. We should consider transferring these powers to the Provincial Councils,” he added. He further said there is no requirement that mandates these powers to remain solely under the National Ministry, by granting such authority, the National Ministry can effectively coordinate with the Provincial Councils. Wickremesinghe added that they need to focus on repaying the loan; this necessitates embarking on a rapid development program, with a targeted completion in 2048."

During an inspection visit to the Sri Lanka Standards Institute on Tuesday (16) he praised the Institute for taking prompt action to restructure the technical sector in order to continue providing high-quality products to the Sri Lankan people. He highlighted the efforts being made to bring Sri Lanka’s standard of goods up to international levels using modern technology and digitisation The State Minister explained that the Sri Lanka Standards Institute is the only institute in the country that awards standards certificates. They have provided Standards certificates for 4,000 national products and aim to reach 10,000 in the next five years. The Institute certifies the quality of tin fish produced locally and analyses if they meet the international standard of imported tin fish. It is the consumers’ responsibility to check whether drinking water bottles have the SLSI accreditation. Herath urged customers to immediately notify the Consumer Authority if they come across locally produced canned fish without an SLSI certificate. The Institute also inspects and issues quality certificates for bottled drinking water. He encouraged customers to check whether the goods have an SLSI certificate before purchasing. He said the SLSI plans to expand its technology and use digital technology in the future to carry out work faster. He emphasised that the Sri Lanka Standards Institute is not a government-funded organisation and aims to provide high-quality products to the people of Sri Lanka through appropriate measures. Herath was accompanied by Dr. Asanga Ranasinghe, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Standards Institute, and other officers during his observation tour."

Gammanpila told reporters, at the party headquarters, the indefinitely postponed Local Government Election should be held prior to a Presidential Election. In response to the President Appointing new Governors, Gammanpila said according to the Constitution the President has the power to appoint new Governors. He said, “A Governor can be removed if a No-Confidence Motion is brought by a Provincial Council. But now Provincial Councils are not operated to bring such NCMs. So, the only way to remove Governors is, the decisions taken by the President.” However, it is questionable as to why the President removed only three selected Governors, he said and added, “The President should let the country know the reasons behind his decision. The President was not appointed by a people’s mandate. He has been appointed to carry forward the mandate of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. So, the removal of those Governors who represent the mandate of the former President is acceptable by the law, but is against the people’s mandate.” By Sanjana Marzook"

Convener of the Health Entomology Officers Association (HEOA), Disnaka Dissanayake yesterday (17) said that by obtaining the support of technical persons, including Public Health Inspectors (PHIs), Entomology Officers in areas where there are no large outbreaks of the mosquito-borne disease could help increase the success rate. Members of the Tri Forces join health employees from the health service to carry out mosquito control programmes. Enhancing the programmes with persons with more technical knowledge would strengthen the inspections being carried out. “True the cost incurred may see a mild increase, but it would be fruitful in the long run”, they said. There are areas in the country such as Nuwara Eliya, Kilinochchi, Mannar and Vavuniya which have recorded a few dengue cases, he said.

He was addressing the third session of ‘Influx’, a public consultation organised by the Labour Ministry seeking public views related to the amendment of labour laws. Nanayakkara invited trade unions, political party representatives and other stakeholders to participate in the ongoing public consultations, organised by the Labour Ministry, seeking public views related to the amendment of labour laws, before going to the media and commenting on the revision of labour laws. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any other organisation has not instructed to amend the labour laws, he claimed. “Our main objective is to change the labour law which is about 100 years old. The International Labour Organisation or any other international organisation has not told us to change the labour law of our country. As a country, we have been blaming each other for the last 75 years and we are not thinking about moving forward. The number of institutions that pay EPF and ETF, is about 80,000. This is very low. There are only about two million workers registered in the EPF and ETF. There are only 280,000 tax paying institutions in the country. I mean including those who pay PAYE taxes. Can a country move forward if even 10 per cent of the country’s institutions do not pay taxes? We are only accusing each other, but measures required to solve the problems have not been taken,” he added. Nanayakkara said there are many problems in running businesses and industries in the country. “The problems that arise regarding the labour rules take a major place in it. They have been raised by employers at various times. The same goes for working people. They also do not get much protection under these labour laws. If the existing labour laws and regulations have been effective, the labour community of our country should have prospered. But that has not happened,” he added.  The current government has made policies with the goal that we should be a developed country at least by the year 2048, he said. “Today we have to develop our workforce according to changing times and changing technologies. If that is not possible, we will fail as a country. Therefore, many suggestions were made that the labour law should be prepared in our country in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the International Labour Organisation. We made this matter an open discussion. We have invited the trade unions through the Labour Commissioner General to submit proposals and ideas for this. I have invited all the political parties in writing to submit their views and suggestions in this regard,” he added. Nanayakkara noted that he hope to write to the unions and invite them again this week and noted that he also invites employers’ associations and anyone interested in this matter to comment at these public consultations. He also said these suggestions and comments can be submitted in writing or by participating in person. (NV)"

In the letter, Lahandapura said the evidence required to refute the allegations made against her by MP Herath can be found in the report released by the Attorney General in 2021. Speaking to Ceylon Today, she said Dr. Herath had brought such allegations before, too, but she responded to him with high respect. This time she does not have another option but to respond to him in a ‘tit for tat’ manner. Lahandapura said it would be incumbent on the present COPE members to probe as to how the two compensation claims from MV New Diamond and X-Press Pearl disasters got delayed. She reiterated that the raising of the issue had not occurred due to any delays on the part of officers from MEPA, emphasising the need to recheck the sources provided to the officials. In her letter, she criticised the actions ofDr. Herath, claiming that “they raise serious questions about the wilful blindness of politicians, who refuse to acknowledge the truth and instead engage in activities aimed at gaining cheap political mileage”. She mentioned that Dr. Herath claimed, in his remarks, that certain officials of MEPA had received kickbacks or commissions from the owners of the MT New Diamond ship and representatives from the insurance company. This alleged corruption had been one of the main reasons for attempting to cover up the incident. Lahandupura charged that the MP alleged that during her stint as the head of MEPA, she had not allowed the Legal Officer of MEPA, A. Kariyawasam, to probe the incident and that the blame for it should be placed at her feet. “The MEPA legal officer had been inefficient in her work. That was brought to the notice of the Minister concerned and copied to all relevant authorities including Dr. Herath who was then COPE Chairman. Dr. Herath should refer to those documents. Without attacking or charging at the legal officer, I have pointed out in my detailed documents that her work is slow and inefficient but due to her connections with higher-ups, the matter was ignored,” noted the former chairperson.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The report also noted that nearly 50 per cent of the workers, who were arrested, especially under the Vagrancy Ordinance, were forced, intimidated or manipulated into pleading guilty by either the law enforcement authorities or their lawyer. In this, the Judges are complicit in this illegal practice as they are aware it happens and do not take any action, the report stated further. As a result of this common practice, 85 per cent of those arrested have said that they have always pleaded guilty. Due to this practice, a significant number of sex workers have criminal records which have an impact on future employment, including working overseas as migrant labour. One of the recommendations that were made by the expert panel was that the State must enable broad-based awareness programmes within the Sri Lanka Police force, beginning with the Police training colleges and extending across to the active Police force at local and national levels. Such programmes must involve dispelling prevalent harmful and judgmental ideas about sex work and go beyond viewing sex workers only as vectors of disease. It is this construct that justifies social stigma and the resultant dehumanising of sex workers through violence and discrimination. Such programmes must include civil society organisations who work with sex workers within a human rights framework, as well as the sex worker leadership of the emerging movement for sex workers’ rights in Sri Lanka. This approach will help the Police to begin viewing sex workers as human beings who deserve to live with fundamental rights and dignity and thereby access services, including those offered by the Sri Lanka Women and Children’s Desk, without fear of discrimination. Sri Lanka Police must immediately issue a circular with guidelines that address discrimination and violence faced by sex workers at the hands of law enforcement, the report recommended. The report that was prepared by the Sex Workers and Allies South Asia-Sri Lanka Chapter Supported by Social Scientists Association Sri Lanka. The authors of the report are Paba Deshapriya and Dr. Ponni Arasu. The Research was conducted by Peer researchers who are sex workers, who we are unable to acknowledge by name due to the prevailing situation of lack of respect, dignity and safety for sex workers in Sri Lanka.   By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin, speaking to Ceylon Today, called for the transfer of teachers who have been serving in the same school for more than 10 years. The policy for Sri Lankan teachers dictates that they should not serve in the same school for more than 10 years and should be assigned to a different school after this period, he said. Stalin said, “The top schools in the country are keeping the experienced teachers to themselves, with the teachers’ consent. We have already requested school principals to proceed with transfer orders for teachers who have served in the same schools for more than 10 years and to issue appointment letters to new teachers from other schools. Due to the country’s situation, there have been delays in issuing the transfer orders, considering factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis. This delay has persisted for three years, which is why we are emphasising the need for action.” When asked about legal action against principals or teachers involved in this action, Stalin said, “These top Colombo schools may have the fame and the name, but they lack the power to withhold transfers. Any action should be taken through the Ministry of Education, with the involvement of the Secretary, as it is already illegal to withhold transfer orders issued by the Ministry of Education,” he said.

Ceylon Today learns that Fernando has left the country for Singapore. According to the sources, the CID is investigating the matter under the ICCPR Act. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka condemned the controversial statement, made by Fernando, saying that it would only give rise to religious disharmony in the island.   Spokesman for the Colombo Archdiocese, Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando yesterday (16) lamented that the risk of religious conflicts cannot be ruled out due to such fundamentalist statements, as it threatens the religious unity and harmony of this country. Appealing to the people who value peace and harmony, he called on them to beware of those who further incite racism and religious intolerance. “We remember that religious and ethnic conflicts flared up in recent history leading to great destruction due to certain statements made by various extremists and politicians,” Fr. Fernando said. Disassociating Jerome Fernando from Catholic Church, the Spokesman for the Colombo Archbishop’s House said that he was not a Catholic priest. Although every citizen had the right to follow any religion and preach it, he or she should not insult and criticise the leader of another’s religion or faith, he said. But due to his irresponsible statement, the minds of his followers would also have been corrupted with contemptuous opinions and ideas towards other religions, he lamented. Fielding questions, Dr. Fernando who is also the Editor of the Catholic Newspaper the ‘Gnanartha Pradeepaya’, urged the government and authorities to probe the incident to see if there were ulterior motives of creating religious disharmony to create instability within the country, noting that there were politicians who thought it necessary to create religious and racial discord in order to create instability and gain power. Meanwhile, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya(PHU) also lodged a complaint with the CID yesterday (16) over Fernando’s controversial remarks. Another civil organisation ‘Sarwa Pakshika Aragalakaruwo’ also lodged a complaint with the CID alleging that there could be a political cat’s paw behind Fernando’s conduct. The CID commenced the probe into the statement made by Fernando that Lord Buddha was searching for Jesus and all the religions need Jesus to find ‘light’ following instructions from President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

About 50,000 – 60,000 students are accommodated by international schools every year and these students have their school education without costing a cent to the State. But they don’t stand a chance in the State universities. Also, by catering 50,000-60,000 students per year, the international school students reduce the competitiveness to get in to the State schools. If not this 50,000-60,000 students will also have to compete within the current system to have a school,” Dr. Alles noted. He also said international school students are looked at in a different perception by the society where they are prejudiced for lack of manners and international schools are only there to cater the elite class. Dr. Alles requested the society not to have such prejudice and also requested the media to do their own research because the international school students are not different from the students at State schools. The TISSL is an association compromising 23 premier international schools in the country. The British Council, Cambridge Assessment International education, Oxford University Press Pearson Edexcel and upgrade Connect has joined in hands with TISSL as Principal sponsors and also funded the TISSL with Rs.1 million per association. The TISSL conference is expected to attract the participation of nearly 250 delegates comprising heads of schools, directors, governors, higher management officials and those involved in policy formulation. Former vice chancellor of the university of Moratuwa and current chairman of commercial bank PLC Prof. Ananda Jayawardane will be the chief guest and keynote speaker at the opening ceremony.

Accordingly, in 2022, two hundred thousand MT of maize was imported by Sri Lanka,” he said.  He added that however, another 217,633 MT is required for animal feed processing. Although there is a possibility of using rice in place of maize, Amaraweera informed that until the harvesting of the Yala season, the available rice and paddy stock should not be used for animal feed.  The Ministry of Agriculture expects that there will be a paddy harvest of five million MT in the country in 2023, including the harvest of the last Yala and Maha season and the paddy harvest of this year’s Yala season. “But since the cultivation work of the Yala season is currently going on, it is not possible to accurately predict the harvest until the expected paddy harvest. If the harvest target is met, there will be a surplus of 500,000 MT of rice,” he said. (FT)"

This fact came to light when the Sectoral Oversight Committee, on Energy and Transport, met in Parliament recently to discuss the current status and future activities of the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board. The committee was chaired by MP Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda. It was discussed by the committee regarding the production of skilled professionals in the field of welding and related technology in Sri Lanka. The members of the committee pointed out that there is a great demand for experts in this field in industrialised countries including South Korea and the need for a formal mechanism to produce skilled workers with formal certificates in the said field. The officials mentioned that the training and certification system for those who already have professional experience in this sector and those who are new entrants in the field is conducted at the training centre run by the board. However, since there is no proper awareness among the people about this training, the committee advised to prepare a plan and take steps to make people aware and involve more young people. It was also discussed that Saudi Arabia hopes to get preserved coconut coir from Sri Lanka for the project of planting 10 billion trees in Saudi Arabia. Kottegoda said the country can get a large amount of foreign exchange by providing facilities for the said process of sterilisation. Accordingly, the Committee advised the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board to take steps to prepare the sterilisation facility. MPs Dayasiri Jayasekara, Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, Yadamini Gunawardena, Isuru Dodangoda, Udayakanta Gunathilake, M. Udayakumar, Kumarasiri Ratnayake and Akila Ellawala participated in the meeting."

MCPA President, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa yesterday (16), lodging the complaint, levelled accusations against Health Ministry Secretaries and several other officials in the Ministry as well. The Charges called for a probe into all fraud that had taken place with regard to the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) data, Covid-19 vaccine fraud and fraud that occurred at General Hospital, Sri Jayawardenapura within 2020 and 2023. Dr. Sanjeewa accused the incumbent Health Minister and Health Secretary of having awarded tenders, during emergency purchasing, only to a few selected pharmaceutical companies at very high prices. The country has lost billions of rupees in the past period as a result, he alleged. This willingness to make urgent purchases rather than purchasing medicines in advance is questionable. He called for the investigation of all documents and tender procedures between 2020 and 2023. A proper investigation should be conducted in this regard while action should be taken against politicians and officials responsible for importing low quality medicinal drugs at a very high cost incurring heavy losses for the country, he alleged.

He revealed this at the Ministry of Education yesterday (16) while participating in the prize giving ceremony for the essay competition held to commemorate the Commonwealth Day. The minister also said various measures have been taken to promote the use of English language among the student community. In addition to teaching these new subjects the situation will be further promoted in the future. Accordingly, at the beginning of the school academic year, children from the first grade across the island will be taught the English language in a practical way. He also said, when English is traditionally taught as a subject from grade three, there is a tendency for students to become less enthusiastic in speaking English due to fear. The minister also stressed, althoughstudents in this country often have a good written and understanding ability in the use of the English language, the weakness of explaining something to others in English is expected to be prevented by the implementation of these programmes. Furthermore, the Minister of Education said that through the implementation of the transformational process of education in the school system, it is hoped to provide the schoolchildren with team education, how to combine the conceptual knowledge acquired in the classroom under general education with practical use in the classroom as well as outside.  Accordingly, by implementing STEAM education, based on the subject of science, technology, engineering, mathematics there will be no necessity to strain and prepare for the exams from a long time and get more marks in the final year exams. He also said that students can easily get more marks through the practical modular method in theclassroom."

The Prime Minister’s Office said a song that has continued to influence the nation’s thoughts and aesthetic values for more than a century; ‘Danno Budunge Sri Dharmaskandha’ has become popular since time immemorial.  This song, which has been used continuously to express national pride and historical consciousness, can be considered a key factor in the study of the local genre of music and it will be an inspiration to the musicians of this country. This will have a unique impact on building a national identity. There is evidence that this song was used as a national anthem in festivals and other occasions until the current national anthem was officially selected. ‘Danno Budunge’ is a song from the Sirisangabo stage drama (1903) by John de Silva which expresses the historical consciousness coloured by the environment of the contemporary Anuradhapura era. The melody has been composed by Vishwanath Lauji. The Special Committee appointed by the PM has decided that there is no legal or other hindrance to making this song a national heritage and the committee has also emphasised that it is not affected by the intellectual law enforcement of the country.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Ceylon Today learns that Fernando has left the country for Singapore. According to the sources, the CID is investigating the matter under the ICCPR Act. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka condemned the controversial statement, made by Fernando, saying that it would only give rise to religious disharmony in the island.   Spokesman for the Colombo Archdiocese, Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando yesterday (16) lamented that the risk of religious conflicts cannot be ruled out due to such fundamentalist statements, as it threatens the religious unity and harmony of this country. Appealing to the people who value peace and harmony, he called on them to beware of those who further incite racism and religious intolerance. “We remember that religious and ethnic conflicts flared up in recent history leading to great destruction due to certain statements made by various extremists and politicians,” Fr. Fernando said. Disassociating Jerome Fernando from Catholic Church, the Spokesman for the Colombo Archbishop’s House said that he was not a Catholic priest. Although every citizen had the right to follow any religion and preach it, he or she should not insult and criticise the leader of another’s religion or faith, he said. But due to his irresponsible statement, the minds of his followers would also have been corrupted with contemptuous opinions and ideas towards other religions, he lamented. Fielding questions, Dr. Fernando who is also the Editor of the Catholic Newspaper the ‘Gnanartha Pradeepaya’, urged the government and authorities to probe the incident to see if there were ulterior motives of creating religious disharmony to create instability within the country, noting that there were politicians who thought it necessary to create religious and racial discord in order to create instability and gain power. Meanwhile, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya(PHU) also lodged a complaint with the CID yesterday (16) over Fernando’s controversial remarks. Another civil organisation ‘Sarwa Pakshika Aragalakaruwo’ also lodged a complaint with the CID alleging that there could be a political cat’s paw behind Fernando’s conduct. The CID commenced the probe into the statement made by Fernando that Lord Buddha was searching for Jesus and all the religions need Jesus to find ‘light’ following instructions from President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Smallholder farmers are amongst the most vulnerable rural communities, predominantly cultivating rice for self-consumption. Lack of fertiliser over two consecutive seasons caused major yield drops, forcing some farmers to undertake negative coping strategies (pawning, buying on credit, dipping into savings, etc.) to meet their food security and nutrition requirements. Through the initiative, approximately 250,000 smallholder paddy farmers, cultivating paddy on land holdings, up to one hectare in identified districts of the Dry and Intermediate zones, will receive up to 50kg of urea each for the upcoming Maha Season. The fertiliser will be provided free of cost and distribution will be conducted  with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agrarian Development. The project will also provide smallholder paddy farmers with sensitisation material on the efficient use of fertiliser to maximise production. Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka Mizukoshi Hideaki said, “We are pleased to announce that the Government of Japan has decided to provide additional humanitarian assistance to procure fertiliser, which is in short supply due to the shortage of foreign exchange. We hope that this support will improve food production capacity in Sri Lanka to pre-crisis levels, ensuring better livelihoods for smallholder farmers and stable access to essential food for all citizens across the country.” Speaking on the initiative, FAO Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Vimlendra Sharan said, “As FAO we are working with our partners and advocating at every level to ensure that vulnerable farmers and fishers are able to continue their livelihoods. While the status of food security and nutrition in Sri Lanka is looking brighter, it may take three to four more cultivation seasons to fully recover. We thank the Government of Japan for supporting Sri Lanka in its recovery and have no doubt that the support provided will help boost production for 2023.” Together with its partners, FAO in Sri Lanka is addressing urgent food security needs, protecting the livelihoods of vulnerable farmers and fishers in the most affected districts while promoting agriculture, including in urban settings."

The Memorandum of Understanding signed between the organisations spells out priorities for strategic collaboration, including strengthening youth engagement in water resources management by creating opportunities and knowledge exchange. The agreement also deals with deploying resources to address youth-related collaborative programmes with respect to the 2030 Global Agenda concerning Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.  Water and sanitation remain major issues in South Asia and the burden of managing and addressing these challenges is increasingly falling on the younger generation. Despite governments pledging to achieve SDGs by 2030, the State alone cannot meet these requirements and a multi-sectoral approach through public-private partnerships are increasingly accepted as the best way forward. Group CEO of Brandix Apparel Limited, Ashroff Omar said: “Since 2007, Brandix has dedicated its Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives to providing access to safe drinking water and clean sanitation facilities for those in need, aiming to create significant, positive change for communities. Through this commitment, Brandix has successfully completed nearly 4,600 community water projects, empowering and enhancing the lives of over 300,000 people across the island. We are excited to extend our partnership with GWP, and foster youth involvement in this vital cause, encouraging them to not only benefit from these efforts but also actively drive them forward.” Kusum Athukorala, Global Water Partnership South Asia (GWP SAS)Regional Chair, expressed appreciation for the support extended towards the network by Brandix on its new youth initiative, Youth and Young Water Professionals’ Platform. “GWP SAS is privileged to have a partner who is well-known for their commitment towards reducing carbon footprint through sustainable solutions.

She said: “I hope the MoU we signed would lead to greater collaboration between the parties in the future both at national and regional level on youth-led initiatives to create a meaningful impact on the ground”.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/05/16/clash-in-trinco-over-rituals-observed-by-siam-nikaya/,Clash in Trinco over rituals observed by Siam Nikaya,Author not found,0,2023-05-15T20:50:00+00:00," A clash between two communities unfolded on Sunday (14) when around 50 monks, affiliated to the Siam Nikaya from Thailand, arrived in Trincomalee to perform rituals at Bogaha Hathara. This event took place on the land claimed to be the private property of the Villundi Kandasamy Hindu Temple. Despite the Police and the Government Agent of Trincomalee advising against the rituals and requesting it be held elsewhere, a group of people defied the order and proceeded with the ceremonies, Ceylon Today learns. According to reports, devotees of the Hindu temple gathered at the venue where the Siamese monks were scheduled to perform rituals and commence their Pada Yathra to Badulla, which would conclude in Kandy. The monks of the Siam Nikaya reached Trincomalee Harbour by travelling through the sea route from Colombo. Ven. Balalle Rathanasara Thera, who was involved in organising the Trincomalee event, informed Ceylon Today that these Thai monks had come to Trincomalee to engage in religious observances and proceed with the ‘pada yatra.’ However, some individuals opposed this and attempted to disrupt the event, which is inappropriate. He further mentioned that the tree and the surrounding area are under the jurisdiction of the Archaeology Department and hold significance for Buddhists. Hence, they conducted the ceremony there. On the other hand, S. Sritharan, a Member of Parliament from the Tamil National Alliance, alleged that the ultimate plan was to place a four-foot Buddha statue beneath the Banyan tree situated on the private land of the Hindu temple, Villundi Kandasamy. He also emphasised that no such rituals had ever been performed at this location by the Buddhist community, suggesting that it was a deliberate attempt at infuriating the Hindus. He added that the process of Buddhist influence in the North and East regions are causing unnecessary tensions between the two communities. MP Sritharan also claimed that thus far, 66 locations in the North and East have been identified as ‘occupying missions’ carried out by the Department of Archaeology. He cited instances such as the construction of a Buddhist vihara near the Semmalai Neeraviyadi Pillaiyar Temple in the Manalaru area of Mullaitivu, as well as the Vedukkunaari Hill Aathi Lingeswarar Temple. The disputed Vedukkunaari Hill in Palamoddai contains Tamil Brahmi inscriptions and ancient Tamil Round letters. However, despite the case being dismissed and permission granted for a Temple Festival on 17 September   2020, it was recently subjected to vandalism and all ancient statues of Hindu gods were removed and thrown away. Furthermore, he pointed out that a new Buddha statue has been erected near the Kokkilay Hospital in the Kokkilay area of the Mullaitivu District. This Buddhist statue has been constructed on private land. The Tamil MP said he has brought the matter to the attention of the Speaker of the House and others and filed a full report on 66 new sites taken to construct Buddha statues and Buddhist temples in the North and East.

According to the Writ Application, filed by the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ), approximately 1,500 acres of forest land in the lower southern part of the Sinhapura – Seruwila road, drawn in the middle of the Trikonamadu natural reserve in a South–North direction in Suriyawewa village, Sinhapura Division and in Divisional Secretariat Division of Welikanda, is being cleared for the purpose of cultivating maize. They noted that at the Welikanda Regional Coordination Committee Meeting held on 19 December 2022, an MP from Polonnaruwa, Jagath Samarawickrama, took up the issue for discussion. Petitioners state that as per the said committee discussion, it was revealed that the clearing of forest lands is taking place without obtaining required permission or legal clearances paving the way for the escalation of human-elephant conflict. They further observed that the said committee unanimously decided to put a temporary hold on the forest clearance until a decision is taken by the Welikanda Regional Coordinating Committee, Divisional Secretary of Polonnaruwa District, Mahaweli Development Authority, District Environment Committee and Office of Director of Wildlife. Petitioners noted that despite the ceasing orders from the said committee, the alleged clearing of the forest land is still taking place as if no administrative decision was taken over the matter, even without following the provisions of the Gazette Notification bearing No. 722/22 issued under the provisions of the National Environmental Act. The Petitioners state that the aforesaid forest land, which is being cleared, was initially governed by the Forest Department, during which period entering into the forest was strictly forbidden to villagers and outsiders. Thereafter, the purview and the management of the said Trikonamadu Forest area has been taken over by the Mahaweli Development Authority, and later on, Mahaweli Authority has invited the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) to use the forest area for development purposes.

When the case was taken up, the ASG urged Judge Marasinghe, to promptly fix dates for the hearing of the case, while announcing his decision, concerning the initial objections raised by the defence, pertaining to the trial. The President’s Counsel appearing for the defence, then requested the Court to defer further proceedings of the trial, till such time the Court of Appeal announces its decision, related to an appeal filed by his client, concerning a similar case, being heard before the High Court.

The President has asked the ministry for information regarding the medicinal drug which had been used post-surgery, the complications that occurred following surgery and steps taken to ensure the health safety of the patients. He also called information regarding the immediate measures that would be taken by the Health Ministry to prevent such serious incidents from recurring. Director DGH, Nuwara Eliya Dr. Mahendra Seneviratne, said the initial tests had revealed that the patients had developed complications due to the presence of germs in the medicine brought from India. He said the patients who had undergone surgery after 5 April 2023 had lost their vision completely after using the eye drop that had been given to them to be used post-surgery.  The Director said that that the patients who had gone to their homes after the relevant clinic had been re-admitted to the hospital after the lapse of a few days with complaints of having lost their vision completely. However their condition was gradually getting better according to him. The patients have allegedly blamed the Health Ministry and the government for their predicament while some have allegedly demanded compensation. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

However, the Governors did not resign from the office. The general practice of President appointing and replacing Provincial Governors without rhyme or reason is common and, as a result, often taken for granted.

Israel, like Sri Lanka, celebrated her 75th Anniversary in 2023. She is an unrivalled leader in innovation after surviving a devastating Holocaust.  Israel leads the world in Defence/Cyber Security, IT, Agricultural Excellence and Brilliant Startups though being a smaller nation than Sri Lanka, infact one third our size. The aim of this national event, that brings together every race, every religion and ethnic group even Sri Lankan indigenous natives, is to revive an Ancestral Bond between our two thriving Ancient Civilisations that had trade ties that span over four millennia. Both our nations are Ancient but we were merely Reborn in 1948. Sri Lanka gratefully recounts the generous help and support Israel extended to us in our times of War, Tsunamis, Floods, Famine and even Covid. Israel has been a true and faithful friend at all challenging times. Israeli contribution globally outweighs her size and resources. She cultivates the desert, provides life transforming solutions and startups, leads the world in science, IT and Agricultural ingenuity . She harvests the purest form of water from dry desert air and desalination plants and she now provides clean energy and natural gas to the world. She holds the largest per capita of Nobel prizes for life transforming contributions to the world and she is the largest start up nation maintaining the highest “Happiness Index” whilst courageously overcoming every challenge both internally and externally. Israel does all this whilst being the philanthropic FIRST RESPONDER NATION, to the world for EVERY global natural disaster, calamity and war faced by any nation. Therefore on the 75th Year of Israel’s National  Independence, we want to extend a warm invitation for Israel to join Sri Lanka, on a strategic journey of togetherness, Solidarity and United Progress, in the fields of Agriculture, Health, Science, IT, Education and  Investment. We the People of Sri Lanka pledge our allegiance and support for a thriving and just nation that leads the world in most sectors. Israel is a nation that we can emulate as our Model Guiding Light of Hope in our very challenged and encumbered state. As Israel rose from the ashes and the skeleton remains of the cruel Holocaust, to be a nation that global super powers, dare to compete and touch. She built her land not with foreign aid or international grants or loans but Daunting Determination of Visionaries and United Patriotic leaders and people."

Chief Inspector Shyamali Dissanayake, the Officer in Charge of the Anuradhapura Police Division Children and Women’s Bureau, said a total of 74 cases involving violence against children and women were reported to the local Police stations during the first four months of this year. This represents a gradual increase when compared to the corresponding period of the previous year and it has raised concerns among the authorities regarding the safety and well-being of vulnerable individuals in the district. Speaking at the Anuradhapura District Children and Women Committee meeting, held under the guidance of Anuradhapura Additional District Secretary (Administration) Shamila Wickramarachchi, at the District Secretariat, Chief Inspector Dissanayake emphasised the need for immediate action. She stressed that the time has come for the Police and State officials to redouble their efforts in preventing and addressing these appalling crimes against children and women. During the meeting, Dr. Palitha Bandara, the Director of North Central Provincial Health Services, seconded Chief Inspector Dissanayake’s concerns and proposed a specialised programme for the women between 16 – 49 years who could become pregnant. Dr. Bandara highlighted the pivotal role of mental health in pregnancies, explaining that from the moment of conception, a mother’s thoughts, emotions, and skills have a profound impact on the child. To ensure the well-being of both the mother and the unborn child, Dr. Bandara emphasised the importance of launching a comprehensive programme in collaboration with local health medical officers. This programme would aim to prioritise and address the mental health needs of pregnant women in the Anuradhapura District, offering them the necessary support and care. In addition to the urgent need to combat crimes against children and women, Dr. Bandara also said it is necessary to launch a programme to assist young persons who have become excessively reliant on the internet. Recognising the growing trend of internet addiction among the youth, particularly in Anuradhapura, Dr. Bandara stressed the importance of nurturing responsible and productive citizens. Addressing this dire situation, Dr. Bandara called for collective efforts from all stakeholders in the community to prevent such tragedies. Anuradhapura Additional District Secretary (Administration) Shamila Wickramaarachchi and Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital’s Adolescent Psychiatrist, Dr. Darshani Rupasinghe, also expressed their concerns and offered their insights during the meeting.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He mentioned this while speaking to WION on the sidelines of the sixth international Indian Ocean Conference in Bangladesh. The Minister, who spoke about investments by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani in the country, said, “We have excellent relations with India. India is helping and we are reciprocating. We have started flights from India to our airports. We have started ferry services to and from Madras. We have increased connectivity. We have to be mindful about the security of India. We have a very friendly relationship.” He added that New Delhi is helping Colombo build its energy sector. “We have requested India to come to the Trincomalee port and conduct the value addition,” De Silva said, in an invitation for New Delhi to invest at the port, located about 262 km southwest of Colombo. He said while Colombo had to sell the Hambantota port to China, it has ensured that the port is not used for war or security purposes. “We had to sell the Hambantota [port]. We asked India to take it over and the US to take it over. Then the Chinese came and took it over. It is a private sector takeover. It is not being used for other purposes. Our agreement with the Chinese is very clear that it cannot be used for any war or security purposes but only trade,” he added Meanwhile, addressing the conference, the Minister said  “Peace, Prosperity and Partnership in the Indian Ocean are in our mutual interest. This region has enormous economic potential and is the lifeline of global trade. The Indian Ocean Region has always been a significant place of interest for all countries and today in the emerging multipolar world, where Asia has become a major economic power, managing competition and strengthening cooperation is essential to the peaceful development of the region.” While emphasising that “the Indian Ocean is a vital conduit for international trade and is home to vast reserves of natural resources,” the Minister said, “it is imperative to ensure that the Indian Ocean sustains its status as a peaceful and prosperous region, where all nations can equitably benefit from its abundant resources in a sustainable manner.” “Therefore, we must commit ourselves to ensure the rights and responsibilities of all States for thesustainable use of the ocean. Many countries remain dependent on energy supplies and traded good that are carried across the region. Those who are geographically located in the region have a primary interest in the security of the Ocean, which is more often than not linked to their economies and the livelihoods of their people,” added Minister de Silva. The conference which is considered as the flagship consultative forum on maritime diplomacy, that brings together critical States and principal maritime partners from across the Indian Ocean region to discuss the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the Indian Ocean Region and ways and means of increasing regional connectivity. “Sri Lanka notes the recent entry into force of the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and considers that this could serve as catalyst for economic integration in Asia. Furthermore, the on-going discussions between ADB, AIIB and BRICS on building synergies for growth are an important development. Businesses in the Region must grow for the region to develop in economic strength. Businesses require capital for expansion. This is why Sri Lanka has consistently urged for the incorporation of an Indian Ocean Development Fund for the development of the region and in particular, establishing a strong Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Management mechanism to deal with natural and manmade disasters.,” the Minister added. He said Sri Lanka believes that there is a significant need for enhanced Indian Ocean Region, regionalism that focuses on augmenting cooperation across the maritime domain. Such regionalism should strive to create closer linkages between ASEAN, IORA and BIMSTEC. “The Indian Ocean plays a pivotal role in the world’s economy and global growth. Our collaborative effort will fully harness the immense potential of the region and further strengthen the bonds of cooperation and friendship among us. Sri Lanka’s historical and cultural significance as a central hub for connectivity in the Indian Ocean cannot be overstated. Our strong partnerships with the Indian Ocean Rim countries have enabled us to play an important role in the region’s multilateral engagements. Sri Lanka is committed to further strengthening these partnerships and engaging with the regional community to promote peace, prosperity, and development in the region, particularly as we take up the Chair of IORA later this year.” The Minister stressed that it was important to note the need for vigilance regarding the security of the Indian Ocean. “As littoral nations, we have a shared responsibility to ensure the safety and security of this ocean. The maintenance of peace and harmony in the region is of paramount importance to all countries that surround this ocean. Referring to the reports from the World Bank, the Minister said the economic outlook for South Asia is shaped by a combination of positive and negative factors. He explained that while lower commodity prices, a robust recovery in the services sector, and improved value chain stability are aiding the region’s growth, rising interest rates and financial marketuncertainties are exerting downward pressure on the region’s economies. “Sri Lanka is keen to engage with all littoral States and foster trade with all our partners to further enhance economic activity in the Indian Ocean region,” added Minister de Silva. The conference was attended by representatives from around 40 countries. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Taraka Balasuriya also participated in the conference."

The meeting was chaired by SJB National Organiser Tissa Attanayake and attended by SJB members of the electorate on 13 May. When Attanayake concluded his address on the future plans of the party, Co-electoral Organiser Ashoka Sepala stressed that the organisers who shed blood, sweat, and tears for the progress of the party cannot even prepare a nomination list as they wish. “We are the true members of the party. But we receive step-motherly treatment when it comes to preparing nominations for the elections. We cannot include names of our own party members in the nomination lists. Nomination lists were prepared according to the other parties that contest the elections under the SJB ticket. What is the point of this?” he queried. Speaking further, Sepala said when preparing nomination lists, there are many who influence the selections. “For example, when everything was done, we got calls to remove some names from the lists. That was a real headache. If something went wrong, then the blame was on us. We cannot even protect the people who are with us. I hope that the National Organiser will be on our side, at least during future Elections,” he said. Attanayake who accepted that Sepala’s agitations were valid, said he would discuss it with Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasaand solutions would be provided accordingly.

He mentioned this while speaking to WION on the sidelines of the sixth international Indian Ocean Conference in Bangladesh. The Minister, who spoke about investments by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani in the country, said, “We have excellent relations with India. India is helping and we are reciprocating. We have started flights from India to our airports. We have started ferry services to and from Madras. We have increased connectivity. We have to be mindful about the security of India. We have a very friendly relationship.” He added that New Delhi is helping Colombo build its energy sector. “We have requested India to come to the Trincomalee port and conduct the value addition,” De Silva said, in an invitation for New Delhi to invest at the port, located about 262 km southwest of Colombo. He said while Colombo had to sell the Hambantota port to China, it has ensured that the port is not used for war or security purposes. “We had to sell the Hambantota [port]. We asked India to take it over and the US to take it over. Then the Chinese came and took it over. It is a private sector takeover. It is not being used for other purposes. Our agreement with the Chinese is very clear that it cannot be used for any war or security purposes but only trade,” he added Meanwhile, addressing the conference, the Minister said  “Peace, Prosperity and Partnership in the Indian Ocean are in our mutual interest. This region has enormous economic potential and is the lifeline of global trade. The Indian Ocean Region has always been a significant place of interest for all countries and today in the emerging multipolar world, where Asia has become a major economic power, managing competition and strengthening cooperation is essential to the peaceful development of the region.” While emphasising that “the Indian Ocean is a vital conduit for international trade and is home to vast reserves of natural resources,” the Minister said, “it is imperative to ensure that the Indian Ocean sustains its status as a peaceful and prosperous region, where all nations can equitably benefit from its abundant resources in a sustainable manner.” “Therefore, we must commit ourselves to ensure the rights and responsibilities of all States for thesustainable use of the ocean. Many countries remain dependent on energy supplies and traded good that are carried across the region. Those who are geographically located in the region have a primary interest in the security of the Ocean, which is more often than not linked to their economies and the livelihoods of their people,” added Minister de Silva. The conference which is considered as the flagship consultative forum on maritime diplomacy, that brings together critical States and principal maritime partners from across the Indian Ocean region to discuss the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the Indian Ocean Region and ways and means of increasing regional connectivity. “Sri Lanka notes the recent entry into force of the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and considers that this could serve as catalyst for economic integration in Asia. Furthermore, the on-going discussions between ADB, AIIB and BRICS on building synergies for growth are an important development. Businesses in the Region must grow for the region to develop in economic strength. Businesses require capital for expansion. This is why Sri Lanka has consistently urged for the incorporation of an Indian Ocean Development Fund for the development of the region and in particular, establishing a strong Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Management mechanism to deal with natural and manmade disasters.,” the Minister added. He said Sri Lanka believes that there is a significant need for enhanced Indian Ocean Region, regionalism that focuses on augmenting cooperation across the maritime domain. Such regionalism should strive to create closer linkages between ASEAN, IORA and BIMSTEC. “The Indian Ocean plays a pivotal role in the world’s economy and global growth. Our collaborative effort will fully harness the immense potential of the region and further strengthen the bonds of cooperation and friendship among us. Sri Lanka’s historical and cultural significance as a central hub for connectivity in the Indian Ocean cannot be overstated. Our strong partnerships with the Indian Ocean Rim countries have enabled us to play an important role in the region’s multilateral engagements. Sri Lanka is committed to further strengthening these partnerships and engaging with the regional community to promote peace, prosperity, and development in the region, particularly as we take up the Chair of IORA later this year.” The Minister stressed that it was important to note the need for vigilance regarding the security of the Indian Ocean. “As littoral nations, we have a shared responsibility to ensure the safety and security of this ocean. The maintenance of peace and harmony in the region is of paramount importance to all countries that surround this ocean. Referring to the reports from the World Bank, the Minister said the economic outlook for South Asia is shaped by a combination of positive and negative factors. He explained that while lower commodity prices, a robust recovery in the services sector, and improved value chain stability are aiding the region’s growth, rising interest rates and financial marketuncertainties are exerting downward pressure on the region’s economies. “Sri Lanka is keen to engage with all littoral States and foster trade with all our partners to further enhance economic activity in the Indian Ocean region,” added Minister de Silva. The conference was attended by representatives from around 40 countries. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Taraka Balasuriya also participated in the conference."

Rajapakshe, during a meeting in Parliament recently, raised several questions, such as “Who permitted the New Diamond to depart from Sri Lanka’s shores, whether it was appropriate to let the ship leave, who granted permission for its departure, and who is accountable.” He also said if the vessel had been apprehended, the estimated compensation would have been received by now. The Minister was speaking  at a media briefing on 12 May. In the case of the X-Press Pearl, questions have arisen as to who allowed the vessel to enter Sri Lankan waters. It has been highlighted that when smoke was visible and two other ports had already refused entry to the distressed ship, who was responsible to grant permission for the vessel to enter Sri Lanka, and who should be held accountable for it now, he queried. The Justice Minister also said he had received information about the MV New Diamond and made it known in Parliament. He said he was informed that the ship should not be released, and the Attorney General had issued an order to the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) and the Department of Coast Conservation to prevent the ship from leaving Sri Lanka until compensation was obtained. However, the ship left Sri Lankan shores. The Minister emphasised the need for an investigation into this matter. The Minister also revealed that when his Ministry inquired about the incident from the MEPA Chairperson, she claimed that the former President had ordered the ship’s release. She showed them an email sent to her by the then-Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This raised questions about how MEPA was ordered to release the ship by the President through the Foreign Ministry Secretary. The Minister noted that if the President gave such an order, it should have gone through the Secretary to the Defence Ministry and not the Foreign Ministry Secretary. This incident has been severely criticised and the most unresolved issue is why was the ship was allowed to sail out of Sri Lankan waters before obtaining the compensation that the country had assessed. He said the current status of the MV New Diamond and the X-Press Pearl issues was that the Government was seeking substantial compensation for the significant damage and pollution caused to the coast and marine life in Sri Lanka as a result of the fires on the two vessels. He also said the Attorney General’s Department has taken several measures to address the issue of compensation. The issue of compensation from the MV New Diamond arises from the distress signal it sent on 3 September 2020, while passing Sri Lanka, carrying crude oil and diesel. The engine room caught fire, causing massive marine pollution due to the diesel spill into the sea. “In response to marine pollution, vessel insurers awarded Rs 51 million and hired Smith Salvage BVB to rescue the ship, for which they offered Sri Lanka Rs 390 million, totaling Rs 442 million. However, this compensation was deemed insufficient to cover the damages caused by the oil slick and environmental pollution. Three cases were filed at the Commercial High Court in Colombo, seeking compensation for the affected fishermen, the cleanup of the oil slick from the sea, and the fees incurred by the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) to address the marine pollution. The cleanup was assessed to cost USD 21 million, compensation for the affected fishermen was assessed at USD 273 million, and NARA incurred fees of USD 75 million.” On 11 May 2021, lawyers representing the respondents to the case were heard, and a lawsuit was also filed against the ship’s captain under the Marine Pollution Prevention Act. The captain paid a fine of USD 64,672, he added. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/05/15/sl-can-save-rs-781-6m-annually-wb/,SL Can Save Rs 781.6M annually – WB,Author not found,0,2023-05-14T20:30:00+00:00," Savings from implementing day surgeries for non-acute hernia cases will amount to approximately Rs 781.6 million (USD 2.4 million) annually for Sri Lanka’s free healthcare system, a new World Bank (WB) report said. The report titled ‘An Economic Evaluation of Day Surgery for Non-Acute Hernia Repair in Sri Lanka in 2022’ further said that on average, 2.9 hospital days would also be saved per patient by implementing a day surgery procedure for non-acute hernia operations. Early discharge of publicly funded non-acute hernia patients after surgery may save health care costs by reducing inpatient bed-days, the report said. For the purpose of this study, the number of patients (40,401) entering Government hospitals for hernia treatment annually was obtained from the number of hernia repairs performed by such hospitals in Sri Lanka between 2018 and 2020 as reported by the Medical Statistics Unit (2023), the WB said. Most hernia repairs are performed at tertiary Government hospitals in Sri Lanka because of the greater number of surgeons available at tertiary care institutions and patients’ perception of better quality at this level, it said. In this context, the average annual number of hernia repair reported in the period in question (2018-2020) was 36,936. Only 32,060 were performed in 2020 compared to 40,401 in 2019, the WB report said. The smaller number of hernia repairs in 2020 is likely due to the impact of Covid-19, which may not reflect the actual annual needs for surgery in the country, it added.Therefore, the number of hernia repairs performed at secondary and tertiary care settings in 2019 was used as the base case for this analysis, the report further said. In the above context, the cost per hernia patient for the standard of care in a Government Hospital is Rs 164,968, but is estimated to be Rs 145,622 for a day surgery, it said. “Therefore, an average of 2.9 hospital days will be saved per patient, which is equivalent to a saving of Rs 19,346 per patient for non complicated hernia operations, leading to an overall saving to Sri Lanka’s free healthcare system of 117,163 bed-days with a cost saving of Rs 781,600,477 (approximately USD 2.4 million),” the WB study said. Therefore, shifting uncomplicated non-acute hernia patients from an inpatient scenario to a day surgery could result in considerable cost saving to the Government, it added. In Sri Lanka, patients who require hernia surgical repair are usually admitted to a ward where they spend four days in total for surgery, the study said. Hernia surgery is a common procedure conducted to repair the weakness in the abdominal wall, which gives rise to protrusion of body tissue, the WB report said. There are three broad categories of hernia: groin, abdominal, and intra-abdominal hernias.  Most hernias require surgical repair, although not all cases require immediate operations. Abdominal wall hernia repair is one of the most common types of surgery, the study said. There are two surgical options for hernia repair: laparoscopic hernia repair and open hernia surgery. Hernia repair is usually performed using regional anesthesia and is therefore categorised as an intermediate procedure. Umbilical and inguinal hernias are commonly conducted as day surgeries in other countries, it said. Therefore, day surgery is suggested as an alternative to the current standard of care, the WB said. The primary benefit of a day surgery is the shorter hospital stay; patients experiencing less disruptions to their daily routines and a greater number of patients being able to be treated in a given time that can shorten the waiting lists, the WB said. “Further, more resources can be allocated to cater to complications and emergency cases that could contribute to the overall improvement of quality of services,” it added. A day surgery will reduce the hospital stay of a patient to one day for non-acute hernia repair in a Government hospital, the report emphasised. BY Paneetha Ameresekere"

Rajapakshe, during a meeting in Parliament recently, raised several questions, such as “Who permitted the New Diamond to depart from Sri Lanka’s shores, whether it was appropriate to let the ship leave, who granted permission for its departure, and who is accountable.” He also said if the vessel had been apprehended, the estimated compensation would have been received by now. The Minister was speaking  at a media briefing on 12 May. In the case of the X-Press Pearl, questions have arisen as to who allowed the vessel to enter Sri Lankan waters. It has been highlighted that when smoke was visible and two other ports had already refused entry to the distressed ship, who was responsible to grant permission for the vessel to enter Sri Lanka, and who should be held accountable for it now, he queried. The Justice Minister also said he had received information about the MV New Diamond and made it known in Parliament. He said he was informed that the ship should not be released, and the Attorney General had issued an order to the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) and the Department of Coast Conservation to prevent the ship from leaving Sri Lanka until compensation was obtained. However, the ship left Sri Lankan shores. The Minister emphasised the need for an investigation into this matter. The Minister also revealed that when his Ministry inquired about the incident from the MEPA Chairperson, she claimed that the former President had ordered the ship’s release. She showed them an email sent to her by the then-Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This raised questions about how MEPA was ordered to release the ship by the President through the Foreign Ministry Secretary. The Minister noted that if the President gave such an order, it should have gone through the Secretary to the Defence Ministry and not the Foreign Ministry Secretary. This incident has been severely criticised and the most unresolved issue is why was the ship was allowed to sail out of Sri Lankan waters before obtaining the compensation that the country had assessed. He said the current status of the MV New Diamond and the X-Press Pearl issues was that the Government was seeking substantial compensation for the significant damage and pollution caused to the coast and marine life in Sri Lanka as a result of the fires on the two vessels. He also said the Attorney General’s Department has taken several measures to address the issue of compensation. The issue of compensation from the MV New Diamond arises from the distress signal it sent on 3 September 2020, while passing Sri Lanka, carrying crude oil and diesel. The engine room caught fire, causing massive marine pollution due to the diesel spill into the sea. “In response to marine pollution, vessel insurers awarded Rs 51 million and hired Smith Salvage BVB to rescue the ship, for which they offered Sri Lanka Rs 390 million, totaling Rs 442 million. However, this compensation was deemed insufficient to cover the damages caused by the oil slick and environmental pollution. Three cases were filed at the Commercial High Court in Colombo, seeking compensation for the affected fishermen, the cleanup of the oil slick from the sea, and the fees incurred by the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) to address the marine pollution. The cleanup was assessed to cost USD 21 million, compensation for the affected fishermen was assessed at USD 273 million, and NARA incurred fees of USD 75 million.” On 11 May 2021, lawyers representing the respondents to the case were heard, and a lawsuit was also filed against the ship’s captain under the Marine Pollution Prevention Act. The captain paid a fine of USD 64,672, he added. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The month-long exhibition of Buddhist art titled Buddham Saranam Gachchami was ceremonially inaugurated by the State Minister of External Affairs and Culture of India Smt. Meenakshi Lekhi on 10 May.    The exhibition featured a NGMA-owned collection of Buddhist art by eminent Indian painters including the legendary Nandalal Bose, and paintings loaned by the High Commission of Sri Lanka and the Embassy of Myanmar in New Delhi.  The High Commission has loaned the painting Maha Bo by the prominent contemporary Sri Lankan artist Prasanna Weerakkody for the exhibition.  This large painting, which had been commissioned in 2012 by the then High Commissioner of Sri Lanka Prasad Kariyawasam to commemorate the 2600th Sambuddhatva Jayanti and unveiled by the then Leader of the Opposition of the Lok Sabha Smt. Sushma Swaraj, is part of the High Commission’s art collection. Maha Bo depicts Emperor Asoka requesting his son Arahat Mahinda to set off to Sri Lanka from Sanchi in Vidisha with the message of Buddhism, and Theri Sanghamitta and the sapling of the Sacred Bodhi Tree being received by King Devanampiyatissa in Anuradhapura.  The Sri Lankan painting, which is displayed at a prominent spot at the exhibition gallery, attracted a large number of visitors on the opening day.  The two historical events depicted in the painting mark the commencement of a Buddhist civilisation in Sri Lanka and epitomise the strong civilisational bonds that exist between Sri Lanka and India.  Previously in April this year, as part of the ongoing programme to mark the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Indo-Lanka diplomatic relations, photographs of two murals painted by the eminent Sri Lankan painter Solias Mendis in the Kelaniya Rajamaha Vihara depicting these two historical events were unveiled at the office of State Minister Meenakshi Lekhi.  In October 2021, the High Commission of Sri Lanka in New Delhi presented two photographs depicting the same murals, to be hung at the newly inaugurated international airport in Kushinagar. Similar photographs were hung at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Headquarters in Nagpur in February 2022, and at the Ahmedabad International Airport in July 2022.   As part of the programme to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Indo-Lanka diplomatic relations, action has also been initiated to hang similar photographs at other locations in India, including at the international airports in Buddha Gaya and Varanasi as well as the Chetiyagiri Vihara in Sanchi shortly, enhancing Sri Lanka’s cultural footprint at the level of the States of the Union of India."

This is largely due to prevailing inequality between genders steeped in social norms and women being socially and economically disadvantaged. 1 in 5 (20.4%) women in Sri Lanka have experienced sexual and/or physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime; and 1 in 4 women (24.9%) have experienced sexual and/or physical violence since the age of 15 (UNFPA, 2019). But only over one third (37.3%) and one fifth (21.6%) of victims sought support respectively from the Police and health care centres.  To bring about a justice sector approach to addressing sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) against women and girls, and gender minorities in the country, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in coordination with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Sri Lanka working together with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) will design and implement the ‘Enabling Access to Justice for Victim-Survivors of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) in Sri Lanka’ project with funding from the Government of Canada. The five-year project launched today will empower women, girls and gender minorities, including victim survivors of SGBV to access justice, demand and receive better services, and work towards a society free of SGBV.  The proposed interventions of the project aims at creating transformative change through a whole of country approach working together with key stakeholders in the formal justice system  and law enforcement. These efforts will be supplemented by working with the health and medical sectors, and ministerial agencies on women’s affairs, while also working closely with civil society organisations, primarily women’s rights organisations (WROs) at national level, and ensuring outreach by working with WROs from across the country at a district, divisional and community level.  To mark the commencement of the project, a launch event took place with the participation of high-level representatives from the partner organisations and multi-sectoral stakeholders that will be engaged through the project. Speaking at the event,  Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe PC, Minister of Justice said, “Victims not only suffer by the offender, but also by society at large. Hence, if no equal and quick reparation is available under the justice sector starting from the initial complaint, it is a great shame. As the main stakeholder of the justice system, judiciary, legal counsel, investigators, quasi-judicial officers and family counsellors, we have a great responsibility cast upon our shoulders in ensuring these victims are safeguarded.”   The project is designed and will be delivered within the framework and guidance of the Government of Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP) which commits to contribute to global efforts to eradicate poverty around the world by addressing inequality, taking into special consideration empowerment of women and girls to reach their full potential to earn their own livelihoods, which will benefit families as well as the economic growth of their communities and countries.  Eric Walsh, High Commissioner for Canada in Sri Lanka and the Maldives said support for this initiative in Sri Lanka is part of Canada’s broad policy commitment to addressing unacceptably high rates of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) globally.  Through partnerships and collaborations with multi sectoral stakeholders, the project will operationalise new and innovative approaches, engaging men and boys to prevent SGBV, while enabling gender responsive legal aid, a post-shelter economic support programme and breaking the bias on underlying behaviour and norms within the society. Sensitive and practical legal and support systems  will set in place approaches that are proven effective, yet new to Sri Lanka .  Highlighting UNDP’s lead role in pushing this agenda, Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP in Sri Lanka said, “This project will build on UNDP’s global experience in addressing the SGBV and ongoing initiatives in supporting the justice sector in Sri Lanka. We are grateful for this multistakeholder partnership that brings the Ministry of Justice, justice sector institutions, civil society actors and UNFPA, with the funding support of the Government of Canada. This project will allow us to apply a holistic set of tools. We must promote a collective responsibility to deliver better services for the most vulnerable and marginalised victims, and further build partnerships to comprehensively address SGBV through the overall empowerment of women.”  The project serves as an instrument to bring the efforts currently invested with Sri Lanka’s Multisectoral SGBV Action Plan 2016-2020, supported by UNDP in line with Canada’s policy, and its ongoing review led by UNDP and UNFPA, while also framing its work within the commitments of the Sri Lanka Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Policy being formulated by the Ministry of Women’s Affairs with oversight from the Parliamentary Select Committee on Gender Equality supported by UNFPA.  Speaking on the importance of this project, Kunle Adeniyi, UNFPA Representative for Sri Lanka and Country Director for the Maldives said, “This project adopts a centric approach, where women and girls are provided with the essential protection and care  services that limit their vulnerability to violence and ensure they have access to the necessary care and support that is essential for maintaining their health and dignity as well as providing a critical element for access to justice for survivors of violence ”  Resulting from wide consultations that have taken place, the new ‘Enabling Access to Justice for Victim-Survivors of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) in Sri Lanka’ Project has been designed to be victim survivor-centric and is anchored in the pillars of enforcement, services and prevention. With an ambition to make the justice pathway safe, inclusive and equipped to enforce policies and provide access to justice to victim survivors, the project seeks to ensure that service providers are capacitated- with resources to provide better services to victim survivors; and to address harmful social norms through prevention measures informed by diverse voices. Thus, creating agency for women, girls and gender minorities to access the justice system and live a life free from the threat and fear of violence."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Buddhika Mahesh said. Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday (11) Dr. Mahesh noted that with four Serotypes of the Dengue virus (DENV) a person who contracts dengue fever once could not have the immunity against another serotype of dengue, which also makes it difficult to produce a vaccine against the mosquito-borne disease. The only possible way available is to prevent the disease by clearing mosquito breeding places, he noted adding that with over 31,450 dengue cases and 16 deaths in the country, one cannot afford to rely on a vaccine to safeguard against the infection. Consultant Community Physician of the National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU), Dr. Nimalka Pannilahetti noted that there were vaccines which had been produced against the virus in other countries which also had the disease. Some of them were awaiting registration from the relevant authority in those countries, she said.  The current serotype of DENV3 was prevalent in Sri Lanka after a lapse of about 12 years which was why the situation was critical. She noted that in 2022 the country had seen only 18,641 cases by the end of 18 weeks of that year. But, this year the numbers had shot up to over 31,000. She said that of them over 51.7 per cent of the dengue cases were from the Western Province. Of them, 24.3 per cent were from the Gampaha District, 16.9 per cent from the Colombo District and 4.1 per cent from the Kalutara District.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said in Parliament, yesterday (11), that the amount of compensation, which is limited to USD 6.4 billion, should be collected and this amount should be deposited in a separate account in the Treasury for the parties affected by the destruction. A preliminary letter of demand has been issued by the SJB to EUSRO (Pvt) Ltd, followed by LoDs to Sea Consortium (Pvt) Ltd, X-Press Feeders (Pvt) Ltd, Sea Consortium Lanka Ltd, London Steam Ship Owners Mutual Insurance Association Ltd, GAC Shipping Ltd and one other company. “These shipping companies seem to think there are groups in this country that can be bought. There is no one in our country who can be bought. I think this will be a strength to our efforts to obtain USD 6.4 billion,” Premadasa said. He accused the government of coming up with excuses for not actively pursuing the damages claim. Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said, the government has filed a claim in Singapore, but will also fight the case in the UK after insurers and owners went to Admiralty Courts seeking to limit compensation to 19.2 million sterling pounds. Sri Lanka filed a case in Singapore on 25 April, seeking damages, which was to be heard in June, but has been brought forward to early May. Sri Lanka’s lawyers will seek more time, Minister Rajapsakshe said. He said, an expert committee appointed on the matter has estimated the total damage to USD 6.4 billion. Sri Lanka has sought USD 22.1 million in damages for the marine environment and USD 273.014 million for fishermen, India has sought 495.3 million Indian rupees from Sri Lanka as the cost for fire fighting operations, which is equivalent to Rs 1941.5 million. Sri Lanka has hired Dentons Rodyk and Davidson LLP legal firm in Singapre and Sparke Helmore of Australia to argue its case. The owners of the vessel and its insurers have gone to an Admiralty Court in the UK seeking to cap damages to the ship and the marine and coastal environment at 19.2 million sterling pounds, Rajapakshe said.

He announced this during the 10th Environment Pioneer President’s Medal Awarding Ceremony 2020-2021, at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall yesterday (11). The President acknowledged that although climate change is a significant challenge for the world, there is no central research hub to study it, and invited multiple countries to join Sri Lanka in the effort. President Wickremesinghe also stressed that the actions taken so far have only delayed climate change and not stopped it. The ceremony recognised the excellent service of teachers, schools, regional environmental officials, and offices, with 129 environmental pioneers being awarded Presidential Medals. The Environment Pioneer President’s Medal is the highest accolade under the National Environment Pioneer President’s Medal, and the winners receive an additional 4 points for university entrance. Aralagangwila Wilayaya National School received the best school award, producing 14 Environment Pioneer President’s Medal winners, while the Central Provincial Office of the Central Environment Authority received the award for the best office, guiding the most significant number of Environment Pioneer President’s Medal winners (25). The Environment Pioneer President’s Medal recipients took a group photo with President Wickremesinghe, who urged them to spread the message of environmental protection in schools as environmental pilots. The President emphasised that being an environmental pilot is a significant sacrifice and is dedicated to the betterment of future generations. The President further expressed his views and said, “The environmental problems in the world today are well known to everyone. Our challenge today is not just to stop climate change, but to slow it down, and we must be successful in this effort. Over the last two centuries, the world has undergone great changes. When the British arrived in Sri Lanka and signed the Upcountry Treaty in 1815, the population of our country was only two million or less. When we got universal suffrage in 1931, that number had grown to five million. By the time we gained independence, it was seven million. Today, our population has tripled, but our land has not increased, and the amount of forests has decreased. As a former government minister in 1970, I remember allocating 150,000 -200,000 acres on the side of Polonnaruwa to start the Mahaweli movement. Today, people are living in those areas, and we have become self-sufficient in rice as a result. If that land had not been allocated then, we would not be self-sufficient in rice today. The world has changed drastically since the time of our ancestors. The consumption patterns of households have increased with the availability of modern amenities like air conditioners, different types of food, and other consumables. The industrial revolution has also led to increased industrialisation worldwide, with its attendant environmental impacts. Two major wars broke out during this period, including the dropping of atomic bombs, leading to environmental destruction and changes in our climate. By 2050, the world’s population is expected to increase even more, and we must be prepared to face the challenges of climate change. As a country, we have taken many steps to address these issues, including the creation of a climate change hub, and the introduction of new rules to protect the Sinharaja Forest, Horton Plains, Sripada Site, and the Knuckles Range. While the environmental laws that we introduced in the past were modern back then, they have become out-dated now, and we need new and more effective environmental and climate change laws to ensure the sustainable development of our country. I am proud to announce that we are bringing new laws to protect nature reserves like Muthurajawela and creating new forests. We have taken steps to create the necessary laws for this. But we didn’t stop there. Recognizing the importance of addressing climate change, we believe it should be included in school and university curricula. That’s why we are planning to establish the International University of Climate Change, which will be the world’s first international environmental university. We expect it to provide opportunities for post-graduation and research work. Currently, there is no centre in the world dedicated to conducting research on climate change. Therefore, we are taking steps to start the International University on Climate Change by establishing that centre in Sri Lanka. We hope to carry out this work with the participation of many countries and give membership of the governing board to those countries and organisations. We believe that 2,000-3,000 people will enrol in this university every year, get the necessary training, and build a great relationship with the world. We hope this will be a support that Sri Lanka can provide to face climate change. Therefore, we have discussed this with a number of governments and will be presenting information on this at the conference on climate change in Dubai this year. I request all environmental pioneers to convey this message of protecting the environment to their schools. It is your responsibility to provide the necessary guidance for that.” Minister of Environment Nasir Ahmed, Secretary of the Ministry of Environment Consultant Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Secretary of the Ministry of Education M.

This was when the Petition filed by Colonel (Retired), W.M.R. Wijesundara was taken before Supreme Court Justices S. Thurairajah, A.H.M.D. Nawaz and Shiran Gunaratne. The Petitioner observed that based on information received from the Election Commission, it costs overRs 10 billion to hold the Local Government Elections and that the funds will be released depending on the State income and the ability to borrow, adding that holding an election amidst an economic crisis could be catastrophic. It was further noted in the Petition that due to the inability of obtaining bilateral and multilateral loans, if money be printed for such purpose, it would only result in further inflation and there could be a further economic downturn. When the relevant petition was taken before Court yesterday (11), the Election Commission informed Court that a date for the holding of the LG Election is yet to be decided. It was also observed that dates would be fixed based on the availability of funds. BY Faadhila Thassim"

Buddhika Mahesh said. Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday (11) Dr. Mahesh noted that with four Serotypes of the Dengue virus (DENV) a person who contracts dengue fever once could not have the immunity against another serotype of dengue, which also makes it difficult to produce a vaccine against the mosquito-borne disease. The only possible way available is to prevent the disease by clearing mosquito breeding places, he noted adding that with over 31,450 dengue cases and 16 deaths in the country, one cannot afford to rely on a vaccine to safeguard against the infection. Consultant Community Physician of the National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU), Dr. Nimalka Pannilahetti noted that there were vaccines which had been produced against the virus in other countries which also had the disease. Some of them were awaiting registration from the relevant authority in those countries, she said.  The current serotype of DENV3 was prevalent in Sri Lanka after a lapse of about 12 years which was why the situation was critical. She noted that in 2022 the country had seen only 18,641 cases by the end of 18 weeks of that year. But, this year the numbers had shot up to over 31,000. She said that of them over 51.7 per cent of the dengue cases were from the Western Province. Of them, 24.3 per cent were from the Gampaha District, 16.9 per cent from the Colombo District and 4.1 per cent from the Kalutara District.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said in Parliament, yesterday (11), that the amount of compensation, which is limited to USD 6.4 billion, should be collected and this amount should be deposited in a separate account in the Treasury for the parties affected by the destruction. A preliminary letter of demand has been issued by the SJB to EUSRO (Pvt) Ltd, followed by LoDs to Sea Consortium (Pvt) Ltd, X-Press Feeders (Pvt) Ltd, Sea Consortium Lanka Ltd, London Steam Ship Owners Mutual Insurance Association Ltd, GAC Shipping Ltd and one other company. “These shipping companies seem to think there are groups in this country that can be bought. There is no one in our country who can be bought. I think this will be a strength to our efforts to obtain USD 6.4 billion,” Premadasa said. He accused the government of coming up with excuses for not actively pursuing the damages claim. Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said, the government has filed a claim in Singapore, but will also fight the case in the UK after insurers and owners went to Admiralty Courts seeking to limit compensation to 19.2 million sterling pounds. Sri Lanka filed a case in Singapore on 25 April, seeking damages, which was to be heard in June, but has been brought forward to early May. Sri Lanka’s lawyers will seek more time, Minister Rajapsakshe said. He said, an expert committee appointed on the matter has estimated the total damage to USD 6.4 billion. Sri Lanka has sought USD 22.1 million in damages for the marine environment and USD 273.014 million for fishermen, India has sought 495.3 million Indian rupees from Sri Lanka as the cost for fire fighting operations, which is equivalent to Rs 1941.5 million. Sri Lanka has hired Dentons Rodyk and Davidson LLP legal firm in Singapre and Sparke Helmore of Australia to argue its case. The owners of the vessel and its insurers have gone to an Admiralty Court in the UK seeking to cap damages to the ship and the marine and coastal environment at 19.2 million sterling pounds, Rajapakshe said. King’s Counsel Peter MacDonald from DAC Beachcroft firm has been hired to represent Sri Lanka in seeking a removal of the cap on damages, he said. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

Lashing out, yesterday (11), against certain parties with vested interests who, they said, were persons who were responsible for misleading the public and the media into believing that fumigation of premises was the key to battle the large dengue outbreak the country was witnessing. They said that with the lessons that had been learnt during malaria as far as the 1950s had prompted the Dengue Unit of the Health Ministry to trim down on fumigation which involved the use of chemicals with diesel or kerosene oil. We don’t want to risk the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus developing resistance to the chemicals that were used when fogging,” they said noting that only scientific method was used in controlling the dengue vector and its larvae so that the island did not see more bodies piling up as a result of chemical resistance in the dengue mosquito. “There is a National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) in the Health Ministry for this reason otherwise there should have been only a fumigation unit,” the CCPSL lashed out.   Meanwhile fielding questions during a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Medical Association Consultant Community Physician of the NDCU, Dr. Nimalka Pannilahetti explained  that fumigation of household interiors and surroundings would only control the adult mosquito, whereas the dengue mosquito’s larvae lay untouched in whichever container that collected water. Therefore, fumigation alone will not tame the Aedes Egypti and the Aedes Albopictus, the two mosquitoes that transmitted the dengue virus. A concerned Dr. Pannilahetti said that several methods, including clearing and biological methods of breeding fish should also be used. Citing an incident, she said that the public were under the misconception that fumigation alone was adequate to control the dengue mosquito. This is not the case. The mosquito’s eggs and larvae would go unscathed if only fumigation was carried out, she explained.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

It is a month-long festival in May that pays tribute to Washington DC’s thriving international diplomatic community and its lively and varied culture. As part of the festival, the first Saturday in May, the ‘International Cultural Awareness Month’ in Washington DC, is devoted to Embassy open houses. Passport DC is Washington DC’s citywide international cultural awareness programme that enables residents and visitors to experience and explore the international culture that flourishes alongside Washington’s renowned institutions of governance, cultural and historic heritage. Organised annually, Passport DC showcases Washington DC’s embassies and cultural organisations with a wide range of performances, discussions, and exhibits.  It has become very popular among Americans in the Greater Washington area (Washington DC, State of Maryland and Northern Virginia, and surrounding metropolitan area), as it gives them a rare opportunity of enjoying many aspects of foreign cultures and traditions in a single day."

Lashing out, yesterday (11), against certain parties with vested interests who, they said, were persons who were responsible for misleading the public and the media into believing that fumigation of premises was the key to battle the large dengue outbreak the country was witnessing. They said that with the lessons that had been learnt during malaria as far as the 1950s had prompted the Dengue Unit of the Health Ministry to trim down on fumigation which involved the use of chemicals with diesel or kerosene oil. We don’t want to risk the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus developing resistance to the chemicals that were used when fogging,” they said noting that only scientific method was used in controlling the dengue vector and its larvae so that the island did not see more bodies piling up as a result of chemical resistance in the dengue mosquito. “There is a National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) in the Health Ministry for this reason otherwise there should have been only a fumigation unit,” the CCPSL lashed out.   Meanwhile fielding questions during a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Medical Association Consultant Community Physician of the NDCU, Dr. Nimalka Pannilahetti explained  that fumigation of household interiors and surroundings would only control the adult mosquito, whereas the dengue mosquito’s larvae lay untouched in whichever container that collected water. Therefore, fumigation alone will not tame the Aedes Egypti and the Aedes Albopictus, the two mosquitoes that transmitted the dengue virus. A concerned Dr. Pannilahetti said that several methods, including clearing and biological methods of breeding fish should also be used. Citing an incident, she said that the public were under the misconception that fumigation alone was adequate to control the dengue mosquito. This is not the case. The mosquito’s eggs and larvae would go unscathed if only fumigation was carried out, she explained.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Consequently, the value of yesterday’s liquidity drain during trading amounted to Rs 121,832 million (USD 381.39 million). Conversions are based on Monday’s (8 May) administered ‘spot’ value which was Rs 319.44 to the US dollar. However, GoSL’s face value money printing (FVMP) debt fell for the fifth consecutive market day to yesterday, this time by 0.10 per cent (Rs 2,812 million) to Rs 2,919,680.40 million (Rs 2.9197 trillion), thereby marginally defraying demand-pull inflationary pressure “as well.”  Meanwhile, GoSL’s direct MP borrowing costs (BCs) sharply decreased for the sixth consecutive market day to yesterday, this time by 2.28 per cent (Rs 1,495.37 million) to Rs 64,198.33 million due to sustained buying pressure of Treasury (T) Bills and T Bonds in secondary market trading, attracted by the high yields offered by the same, but at the expense of lending to the private sector, the engine of growth. CBSL’s open market operations (OMO) statistics from where the above figures are extrapolated; lacks transparency. MP, coupled with being the steward of the country’s foreign reserves and of its debt is the exclusive prerogative of the CBSL. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot.’ The ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt repayments and foreign debt as a whole in rupee terms. Swaps between the GoSL and CBSL are foreign reserves-neutral. Issuing of T Bills and T Bonds is a popular way GoSL raises money domestically to meet its local commitments. Investing in T Bills and T Bonds is generally considered as being riskless, because, in the event GoSL is unable to repay such debt, CBSL is normally mandated to print demand-pull inflationary money and repay such creditors.

The seminar was attended by members of the Brisbane Club, including CEOs of high end companies, leading businesspeople, and philanthropists, all of whom were very interested in the opportunities available in Sri Lanka.  Consul General Samarasinghe, who is also one of the key drafters of the preliminary report of the Sri Lanka Climate Prosperity Plan(CPP), presented participants with the highlights of the CPP, updates on its progress, and three of the flagship projects under the Plan. Speaking on the roadmap set out in the CPP, the Consul General highlighted the objectives of the CPP, including unlocking domestic energy abundance through renewables, modernisation and sustainable transport; financially engineering a climate secure transformation; galvanising climate protection against key risks. He also highlighted the simulated models of the CPP, which highlighted how scenarios driven by CPP policies showed much higher return and more positive impacts than two other models, the Business-As-Usual model and the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) model (which projects how the country would develop if its Paris Agreement NDC targets are met). Speaking on the investment opportunities under the CPP, Consul General noted that there were over 110 projects earmarked, with 68 transition projects and 47 resilience projects.  He also presented in greater detail, three flagship projects which characterised the overall priorities and end ambitions in implementing the CPP. Firstly, he presented on the Sri Lanka Offshore Wind Array, an offshore wind mega project aimed at harnessing the wind resources in the ocean area between Jaffna and Puttalan.  The project is planned to go through 2023 until 2030, with an estimated level of investment of USD 16 billion over eight years.  The overall objective of this project is to finance maximised renewable energy and grid modernisation potential and connectivity.  The second project he presented was the Sri Lanka University for Climate Resilience, aimed as a hub for tertiary education focusing on capacity building and knowledge around climate change and job skilling.  The project timeline will be from 2023 to 2035 with an estimated level of investment of USD 11.25 million over 12 years.  The final project was the solar powered community agriculture project in Anuradhapura, a project which has the potential to be a case study in developing climate-smart agriculture, as well as sustainable land and water management practices.  The project would cover 15,000 farmers in the district, and would aim to transform farming practices through the deployment of solar powered irrigation systems. In conclusion, Consul General. Samarasinghe set out the proposed timeline of the next steps, including the publication of the final CPP including detailed project proposals and financing analysis, and its implementation, including identifying funding, developing investor packages, and designing and deploying a resource mobilisation campaign."

The WB study titled ‘Establishing day-surgery units in Sri Lanka’s hospitals: Key issues and options’ dated March 2023, warned that under such a policy, there is a disincentive for poor patients to use the day surgery unit. However, some patients said they would be happy to go back home earlier, even if they have to travel by hiring an expensive vehicle, as staying in the wards of these public hospitals was not a pleasant experience, the WB said. “With developments in surgical techniques, anaesthesia, nursing and technology, ‘day surgery,’ where patients are sent home the same day for several common procedures previously done in hospital and requiring overnight stays has become increasingly common in recent decades, especially after the founding of the International Association for Ambulatory Surgery (IAAS) in 1995,” the study added. Consequently, hospitals in developed countries have already started to use day surgery from the early 20th century. An increasing number of low and middle-income countries have followed such a practice in recent decades, the report said. By Paneetha Ameresekere"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

AHP President Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (9), lashing out, said the Health Ministry is responsible for the severity of the present dengue outbreak in the country. Kumudesh said a circular issued by the Health Ministry prohibiting the use of the fogging method to control mosquito breeding resulted in the present epidemic. He alleged that the Ministry had issued the circular despite continuous warnings by the ground-level health service employees of a pending threat of the mosquito-borne disease. The AHP President said the circular issued last year prohibited the use of the fogging method. “When one patient develops dengue, the number of mosquitoes that bite the infected person determines how many other patients will be infected with the viral infection,” he explained. “It is a known fact that fumigation of the surrounding area is the best method to adopt even if it was a single patient as it would help drive away the mosquitoes that bite the patient. But suspending the fumigation method with a circular before the epidemic was the reason for the tremendous disease spread,” he said. He said those who took such arbitrary decisions should be held accountable. The AHP President further said there were no facilities to test patients. “Investigations which should be fast-tracked had led to even suspected cases being admitted to State hospitals,” he added.

The Ministry instead was trying to incur a loss of about Rs 500 million to the Government of Sri Lankan by paying USD 0.75 per vial.

This was when the petitions were taken up before a five-Judge Supreme Court Bench chaired by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal, former Treasury Secretary S.R. Attygalle, and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, were among the respondents named in the petition. The Petition was filed against the lack of accountability and transparency in high-level decision-making, that has resulted in the present crisis, while citing a number of factors leading to the crisis. The factors cited in the Petition are the reduction in government revenue caused by the illegal and arbitrary tax breaks granted in 2019, failure to reverse the illegal tax break, failure to take remedial measures subsequent to rating downgrades, failure to devalue the Sri Lankan Rupee in a timely, orderly, and appropriate manner despite widespread calls to do so, the decision to continue servicing sovereign debt without any restructuring, and the refusal to seek the assistance of the IMF until the crisis had exacerbated. The Petitioners argue that the fundamental rights of the citizens to equality, freedom of expression, and the right to information, guaranteed under the Constitution, have been violated through the actions or inactions of the respondents. The petitioners noted that the respondents, named in the petition, are directly responsible for the unsustainability of Sri Lanka’s foreign debt, its hard default on foreign loan repayments, and the present state of the economy of Sri Lanka. Further, they said the inaction of the respondents has led to the present shortages of food, medicine, fuel and gas in the country, victimising the entire population in an unprecedented manner.

MCPA President Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa yesterday (8), lodging a complaint with the Bribery Commission, accused the Health Ministry of disregarding recommendations made by the Cabinet of Ministers and the Presidential Secretariat to purchase 2.5 million vials of ‘Cefuroxime’ antibiotics for USD 0.25 per vial without properly checking the credentials of the companies that have submitted the relevant tenders or calling the latest prices. The Ministry instead was trying to incur a loss of about Rs 500 million to the Government of Sri Lankan by paying USD 0.75 per vial. He called for an investigation into the relevant tender procedure and its suspension of the procedure until the investigation is completed. Dr. Sanjeewa was joined by representatives of civil rights organisations, including Kamanta Roshan, Asela Sampath, Sanjeeva Mahawatta and Roshan Shanta. The organisations urged the Bribery Commission to investigate the corruption and fraud that may have taken place under the Health Ministry during hurried purchasing of pharmaceuticals – especially medicinal drugs – during the past 12 months. Complaints were also submitted against officials of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA). Following lodging of the complaint, the MCPA President said that while the Health Ministry kept saying that there was no money to purchase medicines it is always ready to purchase medicine at a high cost even if it was above the prescribed price. This is deliberately committing corruption and fraud using the tax payers’ money. Also, the stoic silence maintained by the President is regrettable as well, he stressed. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

There were around 300 participants gathered at the UNON to attend the important event. The Vesak Day commemoration commenced with the opening remarks by the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka, Veluppillai Kananathan, who explained the importance of Vesak for Buddhists around the world and emphasised that the teachings of Lord Buddha, which date back more than two millennia, are more relevant to the conflict-stricken world of today. While thanking the UNON for its exceptional support and cooperation to organise the Vesak Day celebrations on a grander scale than ever before and recalling the United Nations General Assembly’s Resolution 54/115, sponsored jointly by Sri Lanka and Thailand in 1999, that internationally recognised the Day of Vesak at the United Nations, High Commissioner Kananathan remarked that it was a universal acknowledgement for the doctrine of peace, compassion, and non-violence of Lord Buddha. The UN Under-Secretary-General and Director General of the UNON, Zainab Hawa Bangura, read the Vesak Day special message issued by the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres. The Secretary General’s message underlined that the principles of Vesak have a deep resonance with the goals of the United Nations, and the Buddha’s teachings of tolerance, compassion, and service to humanity are a source of solace and strength at this time of strife. Further, the message proposed seizing the spirit of Vesak by working together in solidarity for a more peaceful world for all. The UN Director General further said “Reviving the world’s ecosystems – our very lifeline – by 2030 is not an easy endeavour. But it is crucial if we want to avert a climate catastrophe, mass biodiversity loss and food insecurity. In this context, we are thankful to Sri Lanka High Commission’s   generous support to bringing degraded ecosystems back to life, here in Kenya. This is an example of partnership, countries joining forces in our shared mission to launch a Generation Restoration” Venerable Yatirawana Wimala Thera, chief incumbent of the Buddhist temple in Nairobi, and Venerable Labunoruwe Sobitha Thera conducted Vesak Day Dhamma sermons and invoked blessings.

Dr William Ruto. After accepting the seedlings and plants, the Deputy Governor of Nairobi City County, Njoroge Muchiri, said that he was overwhelmed by the continued support received from the High Commissioner Kananathan for the tree-planting drive in Kenya and added that it was significant to receive one million seedlings on the thrice-blessed Day of Vesak. The Deputy Governor also underscored the fact that in today’s globalised world, climate change and environmental degradation threaten the very future of the planet and acknowledged the Buddha’s message of solidarity and mutual support, which continued to provide important inspiration for the collective efforts to build a better world. The Deputy Governor announced that the Sri Lanka High Commission was the first diplomatic mission represented in Kenya to extend support to the Kenyan-President-led progressive tree-planting campaign in Kenya and praised High Commissioner Kananathan as an outstanding diplomat of Sri Lanka who has been promoting the bilateral relations between Kenya and Sri Lanka in a pragmatic manner."

Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The inspiring Vesak ceremony was held for the first time in the main conference hall of the UNON, with the participation of the UN Under-Secretary-General and Director General of the UNON, Zainab Hawa Bangura, Deputy Governor of the Nairobi County, Njoroge Muchiri, Ambassadors, Kenyan Government authorities, including the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Ministry of Kenya, and members of the Sri Lankan community. There were around 300 participants gathered at the UNON to attend the important event. The Vesak Day commemoration commenced with the opening remarks by the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka, Veluppillai Kananathan, who explained the importance of Vesak for Buddhists around the world and emphasised that the teachings of Lord Buddha, which date back more than two millennia, are more relevant to the conflict-stricken world of today. While thanking the UNON for its exceptional support and cooperation to organise the Vesak Day celebrations on a grander scale than ever before and recalling the United Nations General Assembly’s Resolution 54/115, sponsored jointly by Sri Lanka and Thailand in 1999, that internationally recognised the Day of Vesak at the United Nations, High Commissioner Kananathan remarked that it was a universal acknowledgement for the doctrine of peace, compassion, and non-violence of Lord Buddha. The UN Under-Secretary-General and Director General of the UNON, Zainab Hawa Bangura, read the Vesak Day special message issued by the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres. The Secretary General’s message underlined that the principles of Vesak have a deep resonance with the goals of the United Nations, and the Buddha’s teachings of tolerance, compassion, and service to humanity are a source of solace and strength at this time of strife. Further, the message proposed seizing the spirit of Vesak by working together in solidarity for a more peaceful world for all. The UN Director General further said “Reviving the world’s ecosystems – our very lifeline – by 2030 is not an easy endeavour. But it is crucial if we want to avert a climate catastrophe, mass biodiversity loss and food insecurity. In this context, we are thankful to Sri Lanka High Commission’s   generous support to bringing degraded ecosystems back to life, here in Kenya. This is an example of partnership, countries joining forces in our shared mission to launch a Generation Restoration” Venerable Yatirawana Wimala Thera, chief incumbent of the Buddhist temple in Nairobi, and Venerable Labunoruwe Sobitha Thera conducted Vesak Day Dhamma sermons and invoked blessings. The highlight of the Vesak Day event was the donation of One million seedlings and plants by the Sri Lanka High Commission and a group of Sri Lankans in Kenya to Nairobi City County as a gesture of goodwill and symbolic support for the 50 billion tree-planting campaign launched by the President of Kenya. Dr William Ruto. After accepting the seedlings and plants, the Deputy Governor of Nairobi City County, Njoroge Muchiri, said that he was overwhelmed by the continued support received from the High Commissioner Kananathan for the tree-planting drive in Kenya and added that it was significant to receive one million seedlings on the thrice-blessed Day of Vesak. The Deputy Governor also underscored the fact that in today’s globalised world, climate change and environmental degradation threaten the very future of the planet and acknowledged the Buddha’s message of solidarity and mutual support, which continued to provide important inspiration for the collective efforts to build a better world. The Deputy Governor announced that the Sri Lanka High Commission was the first diplomatic mission represented in Kenya to extend support to the Kenyan-President-led progressive tree-planting campaign in Kenya and praised High Commissioner Kananathan as an outstanding diplomat of Sri Lanka who has been promoting the bilateral relations between Kenya and Sri Lanka in a pragmatic manner."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/05/08/health-ministry-ignores-starting-cost-effective-day-surgery-units-wb/,Health Ministry ignores starting cost-effective ‘day surgery units’ – WB,Author not found,0,2023-05-07T20:30:00+00:00," The Health Ministry has not yet developed any guidelines to set up cost-effective ‘day surgery units’ in State hospitals despite the College of Anaesthesiologists having submitted a report to the Ministry in 2018 suggesting that ‘day surgery units’ in Sri Lanka should be set up to tackle the present challenges in meeting the needs of patients such as hospital bed shortages and long waiting lists, a new World Bank (WB) report said. The WB study titled ‘Establishing day-surgery units in Sri Lanka’s hospitals: Key issues and options’ and dated March 2023, but posted on its website on Friday (5 May) further said the concept of setting up ambulatory or day surgery units in Sri Lanka’s hospitals has been suggested as one intervention that can achieve the efficiency gain in health service delivery. In some non-surgical specialties there is also potential to reduce hospital stays by promoting the concept of day procedures, the report said. “Haematology is one such specialty,” the report said. These measures will certainly reduce overcrowding in medical wards, where these patients would otherwise be admitted for procedures with consequent overnight stays and delays in discharge, the WB report said. Hence, providing more surgical procedures in the day surgery units in public hospitals, could not only improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery, but also reduce the financial burden on patients who may be forced to access the private services due to waiting lists in the Government sector or minimise other opportunity costs related to spending more days in a Government hospital, the report advised. Therefore, the following actions are proposed for the implementation of the day surgery unit in selected public hospitals in a step-by-step approach, with minimum financial commitments from the Government, the WB said. In this connection, the WB said in terms of bed utilisation, it is common for non-casualty surgical ward beds to be underutilised on non-casualty days. “Therefore, it is worth considering whether these beds could be better utilised for day surgeries,” the report recommended. Other recommendations were “Consider a centralised bed management unit to optimise bed utilisation across different wards.” “Given the large volume of wound debridement that is performed in operating theatres in some of the hospitals (e.g. Jaffna Teaching Hospital), consider a wound care unit with a simple procedure room (not equipped to operating theatre (OT) standards) that can shunt this cohort of the patient away from the precious OT resource.” “To minimise admission-related delays for day surgeries, direct admission arrangements should be put in place for day surgery patients in the hospitals where the day surgery units will be piloted; In the meantime, the day surgery unit should consider simplifying admission procedures (e.g. a more concise admission form or simplified ward chart to reduce admin load for clinical and admin staff) given the low-risk profile of day surgery patients,” the report said.

Issuing a message for Vesak, from the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue, he said yesterday (4) that life had its share of suffering and wounds, and festive occasions provided the needed distance from everyday routine to approach them with renewed insight. Wounds affecting the world were many, he said noting that poverty, discrimination and violence, indifference towards the poor,  enslavement resulting from models of development that fail to respect the human person and nature, hate motivated and fuelled by religious and nationalistic extremism were amongst them. Above all, a despairing attitude towards life expressed through various types of anxiety and addiction were realities that exposed the shared vulnerability of humans. “Dear Buddhist friends, you offer healing when you embody Karuna,” Cardinal Guixot said noting that compassion towards all beings was taught by the Buddha. Those who dwell with a mind accompanied by compassion offers an antidote to the global crises such as those mentioned earlier. It offers compassion in response to widespread and interconnected evils, he said.  The PCID President said that for Christians there was no effective remedy than the practice of ‘agape (Selfless love)’ which was the great legacy that Jesus left to his followers. He said that the Lord’s disciples had been given the gift of divine love which taught them to love one another. Citing the Bible he reiterated Pope Francis’s appeal to serve others with compassion. “To love concretely, not abstractly with love that is grace, generosity, a desire to draw near, a love that did not hesitate to offer itself in sacrifice for the beloved. “Charity, love is sharing with the one we love in all things. Love makes us similar creating equality, breaks down walls and eliminates distances,” he said noting that the Buddha emphasised on training the heart was especially valuable to move forward together in the effort of bringing healing.     “May we all strive to live with greater love and compassion, working together to build a more just, peaceful and united world,” Cardinal Guixot said.

These environmentalists charged that if such trash and refuse matter is allowed to pile up it could damage the turf and harm the environment as well. They added that though the ground falls under the purview of the Sugathadasa National Sports Complex Authority, waste disposal is handled by the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council, but the latter had neglected its duties in this connection.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Star batter Chamari compiled a brilliant 64 runs from just 60 deliveries as Sri Lanka posted a healthy total of 186-5, and Bangladesh never looked likely to reach the target as spinner Oshadi Ranasinghe (5/34) collected career best figures to ensure the visitors were bowled out for just 128 in 29.5 overs. After rain forced the match to start 3 hours late, the game was reduced to 30 overs per side. Sri Lanka opted to bat after winning the toss, and were off to a decent start with a 50 run partnership for the first wicket between Chamari and Vishmi Gunaratne until the latter fell in the 10th over for 17 runs. After a positive start, the Lionesses continued their domination when vice captain Harshitha Samarawickrama joined skipper Chamari in the middle and added another 53 run partnership for the second wicket.  The veteran opener hit 6 boundaries and four massive sixes during her blistering knock of 64 runs to steal the show, as the dynamic left-hander continued her rich vein of form in devastating style. With Sri Lanka at a decent position at the end of 15th over, there was a mini middle order collapse when they lost the wickets of Chamari, Nilakshi de Silva (11) and Anushka Sanjeewani (12) to reduce them from 1-100 to 4-146. With wickets falling at regular interval, it needed a valiant effort from the highly talented Harshitha Samarawickrama (45*) to revive the Sri Lankan innings to a decent position at the end of the allotted overs. In reply, Bangladesh were never in the hunt during the chase as they were bundled out for 128 runs. Oshadi Ranasinghe was the architect of the collapse as she ripped through the visitors batting line up to end with figures of 5-34. Skipper Nigar Sultana was the only batter to impress with a fighting 37 runs off 51 deliveries, while none of the other batters were able to go past the 30 run mark, the next best being Fargan Hoque with 24. The victory also saw Sri Lanka take a 1-0 lead in the series with one more game to be played on Sunday (7).   Brief scores: Sri Lanka: 186-5 (30) (Chamari Athapatthu 64, Harshitha Smarawickrama 45*, Sultana Kathun 1-22) Bangladesh: 128 all out (29.5) (Nigar Sultana 37, Fargan Hoque 24, Oshadi Ranasinghe 5-34) By Mustaq Sydeen"

Goonesinha, on behalf of the family, has issued a statement as follows: “The family of A.E. Goonesinha is saddened at the damage caused to the statue of A.E. Goonesinha on 1 May 2023 at Goonesinhapura. The statue of A.E. Goonesinha was erected by R. Premadasa in gratitude to a gentleman who helped and guided him at the onset of his political career and thus enabled him to reach greater political heights as Prime Minister and President. The fact that the statue was used as a prop to tie photos of politicians with no relevance to May Day and thus obscuring A.E. Goonesinha’s statue shows disregard and lack of respect to the first labour leader of Sri Lanka on a day that is about labour and workers, and not politicians. A television channel on 1 May stated that the statue was neglected and no floral tributes were made. This is not correct. The present leader of the Ceylon Labour Party, Vijitha Kadiragonna, always maintains the statue immaculately and a commemoration event is organised every year. This year, however, the family was informed that there would be no ceremony as he would be away for 3 months. A member of the family went to the statue around 10:00 a.m. with a floral tribute and laid it at the foot. The statue was intact and looked like it always did. However, she was shocked to see the huge structure tied to the statue with a thick rope wrapped round the statue and the garland round the neck tossed to a side. The statue was partly blocked by the structure. The photographer would have taken the photo after the rope and the structure had been removed, thereby causing damage to the statue. The floral arrangement was obviously stolen. The family kindly requests the organising committee of any political party to please not use the statue as a prop and to respect the sanctity of statues in public space.”"

Addressing a media briefing yesterday (3) Commodore Jagath Kumara said this type of human trafficking racket was reported in 2009 where LTTE involvement was found to fund the terrorist organisation. Of the 303 individuals, 174 have been repatriated to Sri Lanka as of now and one of them committed suicide in Vietnam. Meanwhile, 128 others are still in Vietnam and of them, 35 have consented to return toSri Lanka, he said. “The main suspects of the human trafficking gang, Prabha and Sabheshan are now said to be taking refuge in Canada and Myanmar. Each victim has paid USD 3000-9000 to the traffickers to go to countries such as Canada, France and the UK. The traffickers had made arrangements to send the group of illegal migrants, aboard the vessel LADY R3, from Sri Lanka, followed legally by air in July 2022. The group had flown to India, Thailand and then to Malaysia and stayed a few days in these countries before arriving in Myanmar. A few individuals had directly flown to Myanmar from Sri Lanka,” he added. Captain Kumara said human trafficking was still one of the main sources of income where the LTTE found its funds to function. “At the Myanmar Airport, the group had contacted a person called Tony and he along with some of his supporters had arranged transport by taxi, from the airport to lodges that were arranged for them to be housed and then transported. Food and drink for the group was provided by the traffickers. It has also been revealed that the traffickers in addition have given a small fee to certain individuals to provide food. Some were given accommodation in the city of Yangon,” he added.  Tony had then visited the place of accommodation and along with his clique had collected cash in dollars from them. Further, they had collected their passports and mobile phones. Meanwhile, it has been reported that an individual who arrived in Myanmar had given Tony USD 2,000-6,000. “Tony has orchestrated the accommodation of the visitors and some of them have stayed over two months there. On 9 and 10 October 2022, Tony has taken away the persons in groups by bus to a church. There the group was provided with meals and they had to walk about two km to where there was a small craft. On the 9 and 10, between 11 p.m. and 1.00 a.m. they were transferred to LADY R3 by small craft where they travelled about 20minutes in the craft. It is reported that a group of 10-12 were transferred at a time. Upon the whole group boarding LADY R3 had begun to sail,” he added.   Captain Kumara said before boarding the group on LADY R3, five of them had been handpicked and trained as crew. At the Lotus lodge in Yangon, a victim who is in Vietnam was trained in boat handling. In addition, two groups were trained in handling satellite telephone handling. The skipper of the vessel was a Myanmar national who had disembarked on 11 October 2022 and boarded to another vessel. Following this, two traffickers handled the sailing and another two who have now been repatriated to Sri Lanka on 27 December 2022, handled satellite communication.  The vessel had sailed 16 days before it was in distress on 26 October 2022, following engine failure due to rough sea conditions. Subsequent to the unfortunate incident, sea water started leaking into the vessel and it was adrift for about 12 days (26 October to 7 November). As the vessel began flooding, the group informed various people, including Tony, through satellite telephone about the prevailing situation. On 7 November 2022, a Japanese ship ‘Helous Leader’ (IMO No 94767445) rescued the group in distress. On being rescued, they were brought to the port of Vũng Tàu in Vietnam about 1030 hrs on 8 November 2022 and were handed over to the IOM. Subsequently, they were settled in a detention centre in Vietnam. By Nabiya Vaffoor and Sanjana Sharuka"

She will have the responsibility of providing the side with a solid start at the top of the innings.  Opener Harshitha Samarawickrama and young Vishmi Gunaratne, to name a few, will also need their bats to do the talking if Sri Lanka is to take the lead in the three- match series.  On the bowling front, veteran spinner Inoka Ranaweera will be looking to impress the home fans against fellow Asian outfit Bangladesh. The left-arm spinner was arguably Sri Lanka’s best bowler in the T20 World Cup earlier this year and will be looking to replicate the same performance in the series.  On the other hand, Bangladesh will come hard at the Lankans in order to take an early series lead in the series.  They got a well-balanced attack with a blend of young blood and a powerful batting unit, which they showcased in the recent past tournaments. With both teams having star studded players this encounter will prove to be a thrilling contest."

In a letter to the Health Secretary, AHP President, Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (3) said R.M.T.S. Thilakarathne and Kasun Priyadarshana, two health assistants were presently being treated in the hospital for infection related to melioidosis (caused by the Burkholderia pseudomallei bacteria found in contaminated water and soil). There are many factors to indicate that this infection is an occupational hazard, he said, alleging that the bacterial infection was a result of neglecting to provide a proper environment to conduct laboratory testing for infectious diseases of which some were airborne. They called for a formal investigation to be conducted, so that justice could be done to the two concerned employees. “It would also prevent the recurrence of any more incidents of this nature,” they said.  The AHP urged the Secretary and authorities of the National Hospital Colombo to look into several matters which led to two of the hospital’s employees being infected. He said for over 12 months the sterilising machine (Autoclave) of the relevant Microbiology Department has stopped working while the Chief Medical Laboratory Scientist has been merely delegated the duties of the Department without being officially appointed to the position. He said both issues had been brought to the attention of Hospital Authorities on several occasions to no avail. He said the health employees had been instructed to clean the infected microbiological cultures without sterilisation, which completely violates all safety measures which should be observed during the procedure. He alleged that the relevant Microbiologist had pressured Health Assistant R.M.T.S. Thilakarathne, who had symptoms of the bacterial infection to refrain from going to hospital for treatment even though Health Assistant Kasun Priyadarshana was hospitalised with the same disease.

Francis has been charged, before the High Court, with furnishing bogus information, with the sinister intention of destabilising the former Government. Announcing his decision, Judge Balalle thus rejected the initial objections raised by the defence and deferred further proceedings, of the trial, to 15 June. The Court also instructed the Attorney General to submit amended indictments pertaining to the trial, as certain charges filed against the accused, were incoherent and unclear. A Second Officer attached to the Swiss Embassy in Colombo, had lodged a written complaint with the Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) on 27 November 2019, over the alleged abduction of its staffer Garnier Bannister Francis, by a five-member gang in Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo 7, on 25 November 2019. The complaint further stated that Francis, who is a resident of Maligawatta, had been allegedly sexually harassed by her abductors and had subsequently been detained for questioning, related to providing visa facilities to Nishantha Silva, a CID sleuth at the time. The CID had then begun a probe into the incident, as per advice received from the Acting IGP, and the complaint further stated, that the Swiss Embassy staffer, had allegedly been abducted, while she had been on her way to her child’s school. The previous presiding Colombo Chief Magistrate had impounded the passport of Francis over her failure to provide a statement to the CID, during the course of the probe, after being informed to do so. The CID on 16 December 2019 named Garnier Bannister Francis, as a suspect in the case, based on instructions received from the former Attorney General and later she was apprehended and was produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court. The suspect was then enlarged on bail by the said Court, on 30 December, 2019 and subsequently, the Attorney General indicted her before the High Court on the charge of, lodging a bogus complaint with the CID.

The applications were sorted and processed, and eligible beneficiaries received benefits, with more than Rs 1,717 million spent. To streamline the application process, President’s Fund Secretary Sarath Kumara, simplified the system to make it efficient, enabling applicants to receive benefits within a week. Since the approved hospitals for providing medical benefits are concentrated in the vicinity of major cities, by starting the registration of hospitals located in rural areas, facilities have been provided to grant medical assistance to patients in remote areas to get treatment/surgeries from approved hospitals in rural areas. In addition, the requests of patients have been considered and new diseases have been registered with the recommendation of the Ministry of Health, which has benefited a large number of patients. Taking into account, the present economic situation and the cost of surgery/treatment, the maximum limits of medical aid paid for all diseases have also been increased. Under this, the President’s Fund has also worked to assist low-income earners in various parts of the island to improve their livelihoods."

Addressing a media briefing yesterday (3) Commodore Jagath Kumara said this type of human trafficking racket was reported in 2009 where LTTE involvement was found to fund the terrorist organisation. Of the 303 individuals, 174 have been repatriated to Sri Lanka as of now and one of them committed suicide in Vietnam. Meanwhile, 128 others are still in Vietnam and of them, 35 have consented to return toSri Lanka, he said. “The main suspects of the human trafficking gang, Prabha and Sabheshan are now said to be taking refuge in Canada and Myanmar. Each victim has paid USD 3000-9000 to the traffickers to go to countries such as Canada, France and the UK. The traffickers had made arrangements to send the group of illegal migrants, aboard the vessel LADY R3, from Sri Lanka, followed legally by air in July 2022. The group had flown to India, Thailand and then to Malaysia and stayed a few days in these countries before arriving in Myanmar. A few individuals had directly flown to Myanmar from Sri Lanka,” he added. Captain Kumara said human trafficking was still one of the main sources of income where the LTTE found its funds to function. “At the Myanmar Airport, the group had contacted a person called Tony and he along with some of his supporters had arranged transport by taxi, from the airport to lodges that were arranged for them to be housed and then transported. Food and drink for the group was provided by the traffickers. It has also been revealed that the traffickers in addition have given a small fee to certain individuals to provide food. Some were given accommodation in the city of Yangon,” he added.  Tony had then visited the place of accommodation and along with his clique had collected cash in dollars from them. Further, they had collected their passports and mobile phones. Meanwhile, it has been reported that an individual who arrived in Myanmar had given Tony USD 2,000-6,000. “Tony has orchestrated the accommodation of the visitors and some of them have stayed over two months there. On 9 and 10 October 2022, Tony has taken away the persons in groups by bus to a church. There the group was provided with meals and they had to walk about two km to where there was a small craft. On the 9 and 10, between 11 p.m. and 1.00 a.m. they were transferred to LADY R3 by small craft where they travelled about 20minutes in the craft. It is reported that a group of 10-12 were transferred at a time. Upon the whole group boarding LADY R3 had begun to sail,” he added.   Captain Kumara said before boarding the group on LADY R3, five of them had been handpicked and trained as crew. At the Lotus lodge in Yangon, a victim who is in Vietnam was trained in boat handling. In addition, two groups were trained in handling satellite telephone handling. The skipper of the vessel was a Myanmar national who had disembarked on 11 October 2022 and boarded to another vessel. Following this, two traffickers handled the sailing and another two who have now been repatriated to Sri Lanka on 27 December 2022, handled satellite communication.  The vessel had sailed 16 days before it was in distress on 26 October 2022, following engine failure due to rough sea conditions. Subsequent to the unfortunate incident, sea water started leaking into the vessel and it was adrift for about 12 days (26 October to 7 November). As the vessel began flooding, the group informed various people, including Tony, through satellite telephone about the prevailing situation. On 7 November 2022, a Japanese ship ‘Helous Leader’ (IMO No 94767445) rescued the group in distress. On being rescued, they were brought to the port of Vũng Tàu in Vietnam about 1030 hrs on 8 November 2022 and were handed over to the IOM. Subsequently, they were settled in a detention centre in Vietnam. By Nabiya Vaffoor and Sanjana Sharuka"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Addressing the SLPP May Day rally, Rajapaksa said the SLPP has the power to come back more strongly because those who attended the rally showed the whole country that the people are with the SLPP. “The SLPP has the political experience to obtain power for the people and to give up that power also for the people. Also, we have the strength to comeback more powerful than ever with a great organising capacity,” Rajapaksa said. “We are always on the side of working people. History is evidence of that. All of our political struggles are closely bound with the working class. We never left them to suffer and we always spoke for their rights. I know that some people criticise us. But we always fought along with the working class,” he said. Speaking further, Rajapaksa said some trade union leaders, who are closely associated with the SLPP, have to go through problems because of recent trade union actions. “We will never abandon them. We will always be there for them. We still have the capability to be the strength of the trade unions. However, some trade unions are trying to take advantage for their own agendas. They use the other trade unions. Our people should not get fooled by them. You should understand that they try to create chaos in the country to seek asylum in foreign countries,” he stressed.

He was addressing the United National Party (UNP) May Day celebrations held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo via Zoom. He extended an invitation to all UNP members to transform the party into one that breaks free from traditional politics and charts a new path towards progress for the country. The President also spoke about the importance of addressing the ethnic problem and reaching an agreement by the end of the year. He emphasised the need for all parties to come together and work towards a resolution that benefits all communities in Sri Lanka. President Wickremesinghe also reflected on Sri Lanka’s history as a country with the second strongest economy in Asia. He credited the progress made by leaders such as D.S. Senanayake and J.R. Jayewardene, who took the country forward with the open economy. Furthermore, the President highlighted his commitment to rebuilding Sri Lanka according to President Jayewardene’s programme. With the support of the UNP and its members, he is determined to make Sri Lanka a stronger and more prosperous nation. He emphasised that the UNP is a party that always prioritises the country’s interests and engages in policy-based politics. The President also highlighted that the party’s policy is to always be truthful to the people. President Wickremesinghe recalled that the UNP was the first party to state, in its election manifesto, the need to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to address the economic crisis, while other parties were making promises that they could not keep. The President acknowledged that the UNP had to face criticism over its stand, but stood by its policy. The President stated that he expects to reach an agreement, by the end of the year, to solve the ethnic problem that has been a long-standing issue in the country. With the UNP’s commitment to policies that benefit all communities in Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe expressed his optimism about achieving a resolution that is beneficial to everyone. UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijerardene addressing the occasion said the UNP was the only political party which fought for the working class in this country and provided more benefits to them. “Our aim is to create an atmosphere, where the working class will be able to live independently while receiving every privilege and benefit from the Government. This is how the UNP treated the working class,” Wijewardene said. He said that without depending on short term development plans, purely based on gaining narrow personal gains, attention must be focused on long term development plans. “President Ranil Wickremesinghe has come with a set of long-term development plans to transform Sri Lanka into a developed nation when it celebrates its 100th Independence Day in 2048.” The UNP did not practice gathering the working class people for struggles and protests. The UNP was the pioneer of Sri Lanka’s development by establishing export processing zones and industrial parks and eliminating the unemployment issues in the country to a great extent, according to Wijewardene.

Addressing the JVP May Day rally, Dissanayake said Sri Lanka has reached a critical juncture, where a historic power struggle can be clearly visible. “The country is in a crisis situation. The current rulers are trying to solve this through so-called reforms and legislations. But a true change can only be made through transferring of power to the common people, from these corrupt leaders. The JVP has been able to bring everyone from the North to the South despite various differences, for a common goal, on behalf of the future of this country.  When we go to the people, we can see that they trust us. Sri Lankans overseas have also placed their trust in us. This has never been seen in the past,” he stated. The common people of this country, who were deceived by the corrupt rulers for decades, have seen the true colours of those so-called leaders. They do not believe that these rulers can rebuild the nation and change this corrupt system. Instead, they have seen our genuine intentions to rebuild the country with a true system change for everyone. We will take the country forward with this bond with people, he said.

The Court also released their vessel, M/T Heroic Idun, which had been detained since August 2022, following disputed oil smuggling allegations, made by Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea. According to the reports, the Nigerian Court has acquitted the sailors on the Norwegian vessel MT Heroic Idun who had been held in detention over suspected crude oil piracy. There were 26 sailors on board, including 16 Indians.  The others were from Poland, the Philippines, and eight from Sri Lanka. They were apprehended in August 2022 by Navy personnel associated with the African nation of Guinea, who suspected them of involvement in crude oil piracy. These crew members last communicated with their families in November last year, marineinsight.com noted. On 8 August, the vessel, owned by OSM Maritime Group, arrived at Nigeria’s APKO Terminal to fill crude oil. It anchored near Nigeria’s international maritime boundary after being informed of some delays due to technical issues. When they noticed a boat approaching, they began to make their way towards the international maritime channel. However, the Guinea Navy was able to detain the ship and its crew the following day, suspecting that the vessel had come to steal oil. The crew members were taken into custody and interrogated per instructions of the Nigerian Navy. According to the Foreign Ministry, the out-of-Court settlement reached between the Nigerian authorities and Idun Maritime Ltd., the vessel owner, enabled the High Court to end the detention of the vessel and drop the charges.  Sri Lanka will coordinate with the vessel owner regarding the repatriation of the Sri Lankan crew at the earliest, once the conditions are fulfilled by the shipping company, which will arrange the safe return of the crew, the foreign Ministry said. Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to Kenya Veluppillai Kananathan, met the Sri Lankan crew in Lagos, Nigeria, on 13 November 2022, and took necessary action to ensure their welfare and accommodation on board the vessel, instead of being sent to judicial custody. High Commissioner Kananathan ensured payment of salaries and other entitlements to the Sri Lankans in full. The High Commissioner was able to convince the shipping company to enhance the salaries of the Sri Lankan crew until their release. The High Commission worked jointly worked with the Indian High Commission in Abuja, as the crew also comprised 16 Indian nationals. As requested by the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka, the High Commission in Nairobi, which is concurrently accredited to Nigeria, provided assistance and ensured the welfare and safety of the Sri Lankan crew until the legal process was over.

LPBOA chairman Gemunu Wijerathne said the decision had been taken until the government implements the travel card system. “Without implementing the travel card system, the benefits of the fuel price reduction will not reach the people. Several private fuel companies will be involved in the country’s fuel distribution soon. They will sell their fuel at a lower price than the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). So, it is essential to implement the travel card system with immediate effect,” Wijerathne said. Wijerathne said that the implementation of the travel card system is vital because it is impossible to reduce bus fares by a few rupees.  “Bus drivers and the conductors charge the passengers Rs 40 though the minimum fare is Rs 37, because they do not have change.

GMOF President Dr. Rukshan Bellana yesterday (1) urged the government to ensure that the freedom given to University dons to cause an upheaval in the lives of students who had sat their A/L s and those who are to sit the GCE Ordinary Level Examination and their parents with their behavior is curbed. “These parents have suffered with their children for the past 13 years spending colossal sums of money on their education only to have University teachers with vested interests holding their entire future to ransom,” he lashed out. These lecturers have not learnt to correct GCE A/L papers overnight but have gone through workshops conducted to specially train them on A/L paper marking and have not been endowed with the capability with their doctorates. He urged the government to have those workshops for doctors as they were prepared to take up the task and put the innocent children and their parents out of the agony of having their lives disrupted and delayed from moving ahead. There are 25,000 doctors who have obtained best A/L results. Of them at least 500 to 600 had their masters in ‘information technology (IT),’ another 700 or so have qualified in ‘management’, another 700 have qualified in ‘law’ while another 700 or more have doctorates in Health Economics and there are another 2,500 who have doctorates in their own field. He observed that there were another 1,000 non specialists who also had the proficiency in languages and Arts subjects. “Unfortunately, the university academics tasked with the duty have taken on more of a political agenda, like they did in 2014, when they resorted to a similar campaign demanding a six per cent budgetary allocation for education in order to bring former President Maithripala Sirisena to power. However, they seemed to have forgotten this demand after the election. Once more they are on a mission. Therefore, something should be done about replacing them,” the GMOF President said. “A country like Russia, Cuba or even China would not have tolerated such acts of sabotage, where persons engaged in them would have been executed. In countries like China and North Korea such behavior, which infringes on the freedom of others would be a punishable offence. We have seen how corruption has been dealt with in those countries,” the GMOF President said adding that being a democratic country, Sri Lanka was far more tolerant. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The downward trend started in 2022, when revenue dropped by almost 20% from USD 1.2 billion in 2021 to USD 1 billion by the end of the year. Due to the sharp decline in both domestic and international demand, many factories have reduced production capacity or are temporarily closing. The forward order books have also decreased significantly. Although input costs have decreased as well, buyers continue to request price cuts in order to place new orders, according to SLAMERP Director General Rohan Masakorala. He added that while the US experienced a stagnant first quarter of 2023, Europe had a sharp decline in orders. On the global front, the demand is coming down due to high inventory with buyers and also the recessionary pressures linked to inflation and interest rate hikes which are affecting the total global supply chain.  SLAMERP also expressed concern that the only positive factor they had was the global freight which peaked in the last two years, was coming down due to market forces, but locally the shipping ministry has taken decisions to artificially inflate freight rates by allowing un-bundling of the freight, to avoid market forces, by removing a competition gazette that was originally introduced in 2013. SLAMERP said that they are confident that President Ranil Wickremesinghe, whom they have spoken to, will fix this issue. The industry also said that the government must focus on supporting the export industry to grow, encourage new export diversification and ensure that the national export strategy is implemented along with the rubber master plan, which had been neglected. The country’s economic problems have to be resolved by strengthening the export sector with every possible support extended by all line ministries, the Director General emphasised. (SRM)"
