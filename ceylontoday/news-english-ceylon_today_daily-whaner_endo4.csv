https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/18/question-over-who-will-fill-transfusion-consultant-vacancy/,Question over who will fill Transfusion Consultant vacancy,Author not found,0,2023-08-17T20:31:00+00:00," Serious concerns have arisen following the recent vacancy that has arisen for the post of Transfusion Consultant, at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital. The question is whether the health authorities intended fill that position with a ‘Senior Registrar’ or a retired ‘Transfusion Consultant’.    Sources yesterday (17) said that health authorities were filling in the vacant positions with Senior Registrars when regulations of the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) and the Specialist Registry did not sanction them to cover Consultant Posts. They lamented that the  National Hospital, Colombo the largest Teaching Hospital in the island and several tertiary care and specialised care hospitals in the country were sans transfusion consultants and had been forced to appeal to those who had retired from service and Senior Registrars awaiting their foreign training to fill in. Informed sources noted that while the NHSL had a retired Transfusion Consultant, the Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Teaching Hospital Peradeniya, Batticaloa and District General Hospitals Polonnaruwa, Moneragala and Ampara, Apeksha Hospital for cancer patients, Base Hospital Gampaha and District General Hospital, Kilinochchi were short of Transfusion Consultants and the posts were being covered by Senior Registrars. There were only three ‘Board Certified’ Transfusion Consultants according to the Replacement List for 2023. Of them one was still overseas.  Sources noted that the Senior Registrar serving as the Transfusion Consultant had joined the Sri Jayewardenepura University, while all others were either awaiting foreign training or had finished their local training in mid-August. They lamented that the State Health Service faced a serious dilemma as there would be no Transfusion Consultants serving the peripheries in the near future should this situation continue. However, the Director of the National Blood Transfusion Centre, Dr. Lakshman Edirisinghe, when contacted, noted that at present there were eight candidates to fill in the positions, while the Senior Registrars were also capable of covering the workload of the post transfusion consultant category as they were full-fledged medical doctors who had completed their period of local training.    He noted that the situation had only arisen when the Transfusion Consultant at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital had retired last year, while the Senior Registrar who had been appointed to the post had left for foreign training. But a replacement would be made to the position within the next few days, he added. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

A national initiative to help 1.6 million primary school children, impacted by prolonged school closures and sporadic disruptions to their education over the past three years, to catch up on their learning, spearheaded by the Ministry of Education (MoE) and UNICEF is currently underway. According to an MOE-led national assessment, 85 per cent of Grade 3 children are not achieving minimum proficiency in literacy and numeracy, which is essential in their transition to secondary school and beyond, both in life and work, a statement issued by the UNICEF stated. The event was held under the leadership of Minister of Education, Dr. Susil Premajayantha along with the UNICEF Representative for Sri Lanka, Christian Skoog, and was attended by government and development partners. Currently, Sri Lanka allocates less than two per cent of its GDP for education, which falls well below the international benchmark of 4-6 per cent of GDP and is among the lowest in the South Asia region. “There is an urgent need to increase the national budget allocation for education, especially for primary grades, where we need to boost foundational learning for children, while also ensuring the implementation of vital Education Reforms, so that we can build the solid human resource skills needed to support the country’s development,” said Dr. Premajayantha. The learning crisis has affected vulnerable children the most, including younger children in primary grades and those in plantation estates in the country. “The basics of literacy, numeracy, and social economic skills are the platform on which children build their own, their families, their communities, and their country’s future,” said Christian Skoog, UNICEF Representative for Sri Lanka while adding “We commend the MOE for its commitment to undertake urgent efforts to reverse the widening disparities in learning achievement for children who are lagging further behind, including slow learners, and missing out due to the continued hardship the country faces,” he said. In July, the MOE and UNICEF held a special briefing on ‘Learning Recovery’ to leverage the support of development partners, while more technical-level workshops were held across nine provinces, to identify gaps and prioritise actions.

The handover took place at the Sri Lanka Air Force Base in Katunayake. This substitute aircraft is to be used by the SLAF to enhance its maritime surveillance capabilities. The new aircraft was provided as the previous Dornier 228, handed over to Sri Lanka a year ago, underwent obligatory annual maintenance in India. The discussions for this acquisition began during bilateral security talks between India and Sri Lanka in 2018. Responding to Sri Lanka’s request, the Indian Government decided to grant a Dornier 228 maritime surveillance aircraft from the Indian Navy’s fleet, free of cost for a two-year period. This gesture aimed to bolster Sri Lanka’s maritime surveillance capabilities. After its initial delivery, the Dornier 228 aircraft played a crucial role in various specialised tasks within Sri Lanka over the past year. It contributed to monitoring and safeguarding the country’s airspace and economic zone, conducting maritime and coastal surveillance, search and rescue operations, and monitoring maritime pollution. The official handover event was attended by a Sri Lankan delegation, including Senior Adviser to the President on National Security Sagala Ratnayake, High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay, Defence Secretary General (Rtd) Kamal Gunaratne and other officials. The exchange underscores the strong diplomatic ties and cooperation between India and Sri Lanka in matters of security and defence."

V. Upul yesterday (16) informed Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda that fish prices declining significantly and this would relief to consumers. Upul explained that a combination of factors such as adverse weather conditions, off-season periods and the absence of South-westerly monsoonal winds had led to a consistent increase in fish prices over the past few months. However, he highlighted that the trend has now reversed, leading to a reduction in fish prices. Presently, a kilogram of linno is being sold at between Rs 400 and Rs 500, while kelawalla, cuttlefish, and both tuna and cuttlefish are being sold at Rs 700 per kilogram, according to Upul. It is worth noting that previously, a kilogram of kelawalla was priced at Rs 2,200, and other varieties were being sold at Rs 1,000 per kilogram. This challenging scenario had caused difficulties for regular consumers and led to a decrease in fish consumption. Fisheries Ministry Secretary Indu Ratnayake and key officials from the Fisheries Ministry were also present during the discussion. By NaalirJamaldeen"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/17/no-plans-to-align-with-the-president-sajith/,No plans to align with the President – Sajith,Author not found,0,2023-08-16T20:33:00+00:00," Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said he has no plans to align with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, as such a move would be a betrayal of ordinary citizens. Premadasa’s statement came in response to remarks made by SJB MP Rohini Kumari Wijeratne, suggesting a unity between Premadasa and Wickremesinghe. Addressing the executive council of the opposition party on 16 August, Premadasa firmly voiced his stance. He asserted that there exists no accord or alignment with the present President-led government, which he claimed is “implicated in acts of genocidal and oppressive State terrorism.” The opposition party, he emphasised, stands for the third path rather than extreme leftist or capitalist policies. It is dedicated to safeguarding human rights, as well as the economic, social, and political rights of the nation’s populace. Premadasa also criticised the Government’s discussions about the 13th Amendment, slamming its lack of a coherent language policy. While he acknowledged that the Government is reluctant to forge ties with those engaged in false and deceitful political manoeuvres, he vowed to stand on the side of well-informed and constructive decisions for the nation. The prevailing administration, in Premadasa’s view, is steered by an unelected President, bereft of trust and recognition, indulging in political manipulations alongside an insatiable gang that has financially crippled the country. Their actions are rooted in personal greed rather than the country’s welfare. He condemned the proposed inhumane ideas affecting the working class, arguing that they undermine international principles, language policies, and fundamental rights. These adverse proposals would be staunchly opposed. Premadasa underscored the importance of generating wealth to foster prosperity and advocated for humanistic capitalism as a means of equitable distribution. He highlighted the skewed income distribution in the country, where the wealthiest 20 per cent amass over 52 per cent of the national income while the impoverished receive just 4 to 5 per cent. Labour security and wealth creation, in his view, should go hand in hand. The SJB aligns with the interests of the working class and seeks pragmatic solutions. It will not compromise with a government driven by ulterior motives. As a progressive Opposition, it stands resolutely for the rights of the working population and remains open to alternative positions that uphold the people’s welfare, he stressed.  By Nabiya Vaffoor"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/17/dr-ajith-mendis-appointed-spc-chairman/,Dr Ajith Mendis appointed SPC Chairman,Author not found,0,2023-08-16T20:33:00+00:00," Former Director General of Health Services Dr. Ajith Mendis has been appointed as the new Chairman of the State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC). Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella yesterday (16) appointed Dr. Mendis to the position whilst removing Sarath Liyanage, who has been accused of being involved in several controversial tender procedures for pharmaceuticals, from the post of SPC Chairman. A spokesperson for the Government Medical Officers’ Forum (GMOF) said that Dr. Mendis had a history of being a good administrator. However, the move looks like as though Minister Rambukwella has accepted the fact that there was corruption involved in the continuation of the emergency purchasing of medicinal drugs. But, unfortunately the real corruption is in the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) where corruption takes place the most. It is ironic that the Health Minister has decided to take measures to allegedly rid the Health Ministry and its institutions of allegedly corrupt officials when he is about to face a no-confidence motion. He alleged that the Minister was looking for a scapegoat to convince the public that he was taking measures to cleanse the State health service of corrupt officials. Although emergency purchasing was excusable at the time the country was in the grip of an economic crisis, now, when the situation is more stable it is unwise to continue emergency processing, he said responding to questions.

The incident occurred on 15 August and claimed the life of a 35-year-old individual from South Nakulagamuwa, Kaduwela. Authorities suspect that the perpetrators arrived on a motorcycle and employed a pistol in the attack. Simultaneously, another shooting occurred on the same day in Bodarakanda, as reported by Dickwella Police. The deceased in this incident is Sanjeeva Pushpakumara, aged 43, a resident of Weragampita, Matara. Police Media Spokesman, SSP Nihal Thalduwa said there is presently no discernible connection between the two murders. He assured that further investigations will be conducted to uncover any potential links. Detailing the Kaduwela incident, the Police Spokesman said the Dickwella shooting involved the use of a T-56 assault rifle, with approximately 20 empty shell casings found at the crime scene. While the victim was found wearing a helmet, the absence of a motorcycle at the location raises suspicions. Investigators are diligently working to clear up this aspect. In the case of the Dickwella shooting, the Police suspect criminal involvement. Investigations have not shown any link between the two shootings, as one was carried out with a pistol and the other with a T-56 assault rifle. The victims of the two incidents also appear to be unrelated. Police are conducting investigations. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

Sources of the Health Ministry, responding to queries, said such reports may have been triggered by news regarding the present brain drain taking place among doctors. They stressed that no decision had been taken to halt doctors from going for foreign training either. However, it must be noted that Sri Lanka too had hospitals capable of providing such post-graduate training. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

According to the Dehiwala Police, a large tree fell, striking the utility pole, which then toppled onto the victim. The mishap was triggered by the uprooting of a large Cabovena tree located near the animal hospital within the zoo premises. This tree impact resulted in the dislodging of the pole connected to internal power lines. The unfortunate event occurred as the victim was making his way back to the zoo after purchasing his lunch. Despite his prompt admission to the Colombo South Teaching Hospital in Kalubowila, the 54-year-old Chief Security Officer’s severe head injuries proved fatal, and he was pronounced dead later that evening.

Deputy General Manager of the Water Board, Ajith Perera, highlighted the construction of a sandbank in Ambathale as a strategic solution to address water level concerns in the Kelani River. Despite ongoing challenges regarding water supply to various parts of the country, Perera emphasised the Water Board’s competence in delivering essential water services to Colombo and Gampaha. The newly constructed sandbank at Ambathale effectively tackles two key issues: the receding water level and the potential contamination of drinking water due to saltwater intrusion, he pointed out. Perera cautioned that the present situation could escalate in the coming days due to heightened public demand amid the prevailing hot weather. In response, he appealed to the public to practise water conservation by limiting usage to essential needs. Further, Perera urged the public to actively contribute to water source protection by minimising pollution in rivers. "

Abeywardena said this new pension scheme will be similar to the one received by fuel station employees. He was speaking during a media briefing held at Sirikotha. “The objective of this is to encourage the youth to work in the private sector, rather than trying to squeeze everyone into the State sector,” he said. Abeywardena said one of the most challenging aspects of democracy is accommodating diverse perspectives and voices. People approach problems from various angles, leading to differing viewpoints. In response to queries about differing opinions within the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Abeywardena asserted that in a democratic nation, individuals have the right to express their views independently. He emphasised the need to avoid confusion arising from such statements. Regarding the 13th Amendment, Abeywardena conveyed that it is a legal norm. He highlighted the importance of transferring ownership of properties presently under Provincial Council (PC) members or affiliated officials to the public. “The privileges granted to PC members under the 13th Amendment should benefit ordinary citizens,” he added. He noted that certain factions might attempt to create divisions for political gain. According to Abeywardena, the President has taken decisive measures to safeguard Sri Lanka’s unity, encompassing the Northern and Eastern regions. Statements made by specific groups concerning the 13th Amendment are based on their understanding of the constitutional provisions. He emphasised the media’s crucial role in presenting accurate information to the public. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

It emphasised the need to introduce single-door buses to address this issue. Speaking to Ceylon Today, LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijerathne pointed out that drivers of metre-less taxis are cheating passengers. “There is a pressing need to introduce more single-door buses. Three-wheeler drivers often overcharge passengers for short-distance travel. To tackle this problem, we have the opportunity to introduce single-door buses on rural roads. We have engaged in extensive discussions with the Transport Ministry Secretary to implement this change,” Wijerathne explained. He also highlighted that they have been receiving complaints about people in rural areas being unable to afford transportation to hospitals due to prohibitive charges. “Even individuals in urgent need, such as patients, are facing serious difficulties as a result. Therefore, the LPBOA has appealed to the Transport Ministry to authorise the import of small buses, with a capacity of at least 10 seats,” Wijerathne said. He further proposed that the Government should launch night transport services using single-door buses. He argued that working-class passengers struggle to commute home, and many are forced to refuse late shifts due to poor transport systems. Wijerathne suggested that if necessary, a modest increase of 10 per cent in bus fares for night transport could be considered to ensure the efficiency of the service. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Secretary of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Haritha Aluthge, speaking to the media on Tuesday (15), said the Ministry’s inefficient officials were unable to resolve the brain drain taking place amongst the medical fraternity. Referring to the interview given by the Director Tertiary Care on Monday (14), he accused the health official of merely grabbing the issue by its “tail” and toying with it instead of finding solutions. He said the particular Director’s comments would only result in the medical practitioners who had gone for foreign training with the intention of returning also making up their minds to leave for good. “Medical Administrators such as the Acting Deputy Director General (Medical Services –II) and the Director Tertiary Care depicted the tragedy in the field of medical administration of the island,” he said.  “The Director Tertiary Care should know that he is serving in the unit dealing with specialist doctors. The treatment that they receive when they seek the services of the Tertiary Care Unit could also contribute towards their decision to leave,” he lamented.  “We warned that the Health Ministry and the political authorities of this country have followed a very dormant policy while no matter how much the GMOA cautioned them, the Ministry of Health is following its ineffective policy as usual.” The GMOA Secretary lamented that whenever his outfit had brought up this issue, some people had used social media to settle their grudge against doctors. “In addition to so many issues plaguing the country’s State health service including the present medicinal drug issues and the cost of drugs, we are also faced with brain drain,” he said. The GMOA Secretary said they had submitted several proposals to resolve the issue earlier and they had proposed a special salary structure for medical practitioners in accordance with their market value and performance.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Ltd.’s ambitious plan to construct a petroleum refinery with a capacity of 420,000 barrels per day in the Hambantota area, exclusively for the export market, has hit a roadblock, the Government Information office said yesterday. “The Cabinet of Ministers, following its approval on 17 September 2019, to forge an agreement between the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and Hambantota Oil Refinery (Pvt.) Ltd., has now decided to cancel the agreement due to non-compliance with the stipulated terms,” it stated. Under the original agreement, the Hambantota Oil Refinery (Pvt.) Ltd. was slated to be allocated 1,200 acres of land on a 50-year long-term lease basis for the purpose of establishing the petroleum refinery. However, the project has faced delays as the project proponent has not secured the designated land on a lease basis and has consequently failed to initiate the project’s implementation. “Repeated attempts to communicate and prompt action from the project proponent have yielded no response, leading to concerns about the project’s viability and adherence to the terms outlined in the initial agreement. Despite multiple written notices urging the project proponent to adhere to the terms of the agreement, there has been no substantial progress on the ground. Given the non-compliance and lack of progress, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved a proposal put forth by the President, who also holds the role of Minister of Investment Promotion. This proposal advocates for the cancellation of the agreement between the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and Hambantota Oil Refinery (Pvt.) Ltd.” This decision reflects the Government’s commitment to ensuring that projects aligned with national development goals are executed efficiently and in accordance with established protocols. The cancellation of the agreement underscores the importance of adherence to agreements and transparency in the execution of large-scale projects that hold significant economic and strategic implications. As the agreement is rescinded, the future of the Hambantota Oil Refinery project remains uncertain. This development also sheds light on the complexities and challenges that can arise in the execution of major infrastructure projects, particularly when key stakeholders fail to uphold their commitments and responsibilities outlined in the initial agreement.

This was revealed when the  Auditor General’s report was taken up during a recent meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA). The endeavour had received support from the World Meteorological Organisation, a development highlighted by the Parliamentary media unit. The disclosure came to the fore during a session held on 10 August, when officials from the Department of Meteorology appeared before COPA. In a project initiated in 2008, records revealed an expenditure of approximately Rs 402 million on the radar system, with Rs 323 million sourced from the World Meteorological Organisation. Interestingly, it came to light that prior to bringing the radar system to Sri Lanka, a Department of Meteorology officer had assessed the machine and advised against its import due to its non-operational condition. Further investigation by officials from the Auditor General’s Department revealed that years were spent preparing a road to the designated location, causing the equipment to become obsolete. The already dire situation escalated when a crane transporting the load collapsed, damaging some of the equipment, while the rest remains unaccounted for due to the condition of the dilapidated road. Adding to the complexity, both the Police and the Bribery and Corruption Commission have initiated investigations into the matter. Consequently, the COPA underscored the pressing necessity for the Department of Meteorology to promptly execute effective projects using modern technology to ensure precise forecasts.

This is due to the Labour Ministry Commissioners and top officials, having allegedly held a protest opposite the Ministry premises, to oppose the arrest of current Secretary to the said Ministry, R.P.A. Wimalaweera, after the Horana Chief Magistrate’s Court had issued an order for his arrest, connected to an incident that had taken place at the Horana Rubber Factory, five years ago. The petition had been lodged with the Apex Court, by M. Susantha Ariyaratne, Lalith Karunathileke and W.A. Lal Jayatissa. The petitioners have also moved the Supreme Court, to issue an order, to the Attorney General, to file legal action against IGP C. D. Wickremaratne as well, after the latter had failed to heed the order issued by the Horana Chief Magistrate, to arrest the suspect Secretary, within a seven-day period and produce him in Court.

The petitioners have further pointed out to the Supreme Court, that the first suspect in the case, Peiris, after being arrested in connection with the incident had been subsequently enlarged on bail, but that the second suspect Wimalaweera, though had been noticed to appear in Court, has continued to abscond case proceedings to date. They have informed the Supreme Court, that the suspect Ministry Secretary, had filed a petition in the Panadura Chief Magistrate’s Court, praying the Court to invalidate a notice issued to him by the Horana Chief Magistrate’s Court, to appear in Court, on 24 July. They have stated that the petition filed by the suspect Secretary, had been dismissed by the High Court Judge, ordering him to surrender himself to the Horana Chief Magistrate’s Court, forthwith and that without heeding that order, the suspect has continued to work at his Ministry. The petitioners have alleged that due to such a situation, a few Commissioners and top officers of the Labour Ministry, had staged a demonstration at the Ministry premises, during the afternoon of 27 July, opposing the order issued by the Horana Chief Magistrate, three days earlier, for the arrest of the suspect concerned,. They had added in their petition, that they were also in possession of video evidence, to further substantiate their charges, against the suspect concerned. The petitioners have mentioned that if anyone were to force, intimidate, threaten or coax, a person to submit fake evidence during a trial, it is a punishable offence and if found guilty, could be punished by imprisonment and a fine.

Later, they requested Rs 9.6 million following the criteria set by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In contrast, the CEB proposed a compensation of Rs 1.6 million to cover the loss of land for laying a 630-metre power cable that would establish the connection between the Southern Province and the CEB’s main transmission line,” Wijesekara said. He also emphasised that, contrary to certain claims, there hasn’t been a necessity for scheduled power outages so far. He criticised certain groups for ‘misguiding’ the public on this matter.

They have mentioned in their petition, that former Commissioner of the Labour Ministry Ashoka Peiris and the former Commissioner General of the said Ministry and the present Secretary Wimalaweera, had been charged with intimidating and threatening Inspector of the Kalutara Rubber Factory Rukman Kumar Hemachandra, demanding that he produce bogus evidence, during the trial being heard connected to an incident, that had occurred at the premises of the Horana rubber factory, in 2018. The petitioners have further pointed out to the Supreme Court, that the first suspect in the case, Peiris, after being arrested in connection with the incident had been subsequently enlarged on bail, but that the second suspect Wimalaweera, though had been noticed to appear in Court, has continued to abscond case proceedings to date. They have informed the Supreme Court, that the suspect Ministry Secretary, had filed a petition in the Panadura Chief Magistrate’s Court, praying the Court to invalidate a notice issued to him by the Horana Chief Magistrate’s Court, to appear in Court, on 24 July. They have stated that the petition filed by the suspect Secretary, had been dismissed by the High Court Judge, ordering him to surrender himself to the Horana Chief Magistrate’s Court, forthwith and that without heeding that order, the suspect has continued to work at his Ministry. The petitioners have alleged that due to such a situation, a few Commissioners and top officers of the Labour Ministry, had staged a demonstration at the Ministry premises, during the afternoon of 27 July, opposing the order issued by the Horana Chief Magistrate, three days earlier, for the arrest of the suspect concerned,. They had added in their petition, that they were also in possession of video evidence, to further substantiate their charges, against the suspect concerned. The petitioners have mentioned that if anyone were to force, intimidate, threaten or coax, a person to submit fake evidence during a trial, it is a punishable offence and if found guilty, could be punished by imprisonment and a fine.

Their Petition seeks to overturn the decision taken by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), to suspend their party memberships and disqualify them from their Parliamentary Seats. SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara is among those named as respondents to the Petition. On 18 July, the SJB Working Committee voted to expel both Fernando and Nanayakkara from the Party. Back in May 2022, the SJB had initially suspended the party memberships of these two parliamentarians after they accepted ministerial roles within the government. This action was taken by the SJB in response to their deviation from party principles. Harin Fernando was appointed as the Minister of Tourism & Lands, while Manusha Nanayakkara was appointed as the Minister of Labour & Foreign Employment. Fernando and Nanayakkara had explained that their decision to take up these ministerial roles under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was due to their intention to address the ongoing economic crisis in the country. They mentioned that their efforts towards a collective solution had not received a positive responses from other political party leaders. However, on 9 July 2022, both of them, along with the entire Cabinet, resigned from their ministerial positions following then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s announcement of his intention to step down. Interestingly, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, upon forming a new Cabinet on 22 July 2022, reappointed both Fernando and Nanayakkara to the same ministerial portfolios they had previously held."

However, achieving this goal presents a significant challenge due to the proliferation of fungi and parasites. Urgent measures are necessary to address this issue promptly in order to safeguard the industry and the livelihoods of the farmers, he said. Devananda emphasised that swift action will be taken to resolve the challenges currently faced by shrimp farmers. He further highlighted that the Fisheries Ministry holds the responsibility of enhancing the infrastructure of shrimp farms to elevate their standards. This development is vital as shrimp exports contribute substantially to the country’s foreign income, following products like tea, rubber, and coconut. In a meeting held on 11 August, at the Fisheries Ministry in Colombo, Devananda engaged with representatives of the Sri Lanka Aquaculture Development Alliance (SLADA) to discuss numerous issues affecting the country’s fisheries industry. Devananda shared that SLADA representatives emphasised the need for collaborative research with the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) and the National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA) to address the ongoing challenges. The aim is to implement the recommendations of these organisations to mitigate the situation. The Minister directed officials from NAQDA to work closely with NARA officials, facilitating research on the impacted shrimp farms until the procurement orders for necessary equipment are fulfilled. Devananda highlighted that Sri Lankan shrimp holds a strong demand in international fish markets, and safeguarding and advancing this industry is a crucial responsibility of the Government. The Fisheries Minister expressed concerns about potential international efforts to undermine this industry, affirming that the Government is actively monitoring such possibilities. Devananda also voiced apprehension that the disease affecting shrimp farms could resurface, underscoring the need for vigilance among NARA officials. Plans are underway to discuss with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the possibility of removing import taxes on shrimp feed, further bolstering the industry. BY Naalir Jamaldeen"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer.

Speaking to the media yesterday (14), SJB MP Eran Wickramaratne referred to the ruling and called upon the Speaker to reveal the names of the legal experts he sought counsel from, prior to announcing his decision on the DDR motion in Parliament last week. Wickramaratne expressed the SJB’s interest in knowing the experts’ identities so that they could also engage with them. One of the key questions posed was whether the Speaker possesses the authority to rule on a motion based on legal advice. He offered a hypothetical scenario as an example: “if a motion were passed in Parliament to abolish the judiciary, would the government be legally obligated to implement it, akin to legislation?” Moreover, Wickramaratne proposed an amendment to the existing law, advocating for the introduction of provisions enabling a ‘post judicial review process on Bills’.  He highlighted that Sri Lanka lacks a mechanism for post-judicial review of Bills. Currently, there is no method to ascertain whether amendments made to legislations during the committee stage in the House align with the Constitution. Last week, the Speaker, through his ruling, emphasised that no Court established under Sri Lanka’s Constitution holds the authority to issue orders or judgments against a resolution that has already been approved by Parliament. This declaration has sparked debates over the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government. As the discussions continue, the SJB seeks clarity on the Speaker’s consultation process with legal experts and hopes to address concerns regarding the interplay between parliamentary decisions and judicial oversight.

He was speaking at the 150th Anniversary celebration of St. Thomas’ College, Matale yesterday (13). “To propel the nation’s economic development, an annual inflow of at least USD 1 billion is essential. The initial step toward achieving this goal involves increasing foreign exchange inflows from existing sectors,” he said. President Wickremesinghe further said, “Our primary income sources are foreign employment and export earnings. Unfortunately, the economic situation in countries like Europe and America, particularly affecting the garment industry, has shown regression. Consequently, we shouldn’t anticipate substantial revenue from these sectors this year. Thus, our attention must pivot to tourism. Accordingly, we have devised comprehensive plans to significantly enhance our country’s tourism sector throughout this year and the following year.” Additionally, there is a pressing need to double our export revenue. To achieve this, attracting investors and providing them with the requisite facilities is essential. New initiatives such as the development of the Port City have been set in motion. Further, advancing rapidly over the next decade with technologies like Artificial Intelligence is paramount; our success or failure hinges on our ability to maintain this momentum, he pointed out. President Wickremesinghe highlighted that resolving the country’s economic challenges goes beyond the success of the debt optimisation programme. He emphasised the need to promptly initiate an economy-building strategy guided by sound decisions. He cautioned that failure to proactively adopt a new programme would inevitably result in the country facing another economic hurdle within a decade. The President expressed his vision of propelling the country forward through comprehensive modernisation. To achieve this, he announced the establishment of the Technology Promotion Council and the Digital Transformation Commission, aimed at accelerating the nation’s digital evolution.

This situation is also posing a question mark in the eyes of healthcare professionals,” he asserted. “Over the past three months, the collective count of deaths, allergic reactions, and cases of blindness, attributed to antibiotics, anesthetics, and eye drops, is approaching 40. Hospital records additionally indicate that nearly ten patients have succumbed to allergies. The Ministry of Health has maintained that the demise of these patients is not linked to the quality of the drugs, but rather to complications and allergic responses,” he added Speaking further, he emphasised that if anyone deems it normal for almost ten patients to die due to medication in a very brief period, they should undergo an independent medical evaluation. He also pointed out that in the 74 years since gaining independence, such a distressing number of deaths due to drug allergies within a condensed timeframe has not been observed. Dr. Sanjeewa further highlighted that this situation is far from ordinary, remarking that the Ministry of Health has become a source of amusement for the public due to the selective media releases that aim to downplay real issues. Dr. Sanjeewa asserted that the Ministry of Health should promptly issue a statement clarifying whether patients in Sri Lanka are being subjected to medical tests, especially during economic difficulties, whether knowingly or unknowingly.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The case, numbered HC (Civil) 1/2020/IP and filed in 2020, aimed to nullify Stassen Exports’ ‘Hana Tea’ Trademark which prominently featured an image of a ‘bitten apple’. The dismissal came under the ruling of Judge Pradeep Hettiarachchi, accompanied by penalty costs amounting to 500 per cent. In response to the lawsuit, Stassen Exports submitted a comprehensive counterargument, outlining several key points. Those key points were Stassen Exports legally obtained registration of its ‘Hana Tea’ Trademark (No. 180551) for the category of ‘Tea’ under Class 30, effective from 23 May 2013, Apple Inc., being an Information Technology Company from the USA, is not involved in the sale of food or beverage items, including tea-related products, no direct competition or unfair competition exists between the products of the Plaintiff and the Defendant, given their vastly different natures and scopes and Stassen Exports’ ‘Hana Tea’ Trademark is distinct and not indicative of Apple’s products. Also, it was outlined the Plaintiff cannot claim exclusive rights over an image of an apple with a bite taken out, as this symbol is universally recognised and cannot be attributed solely to Apple and the Defendant highlighted instances where Apple Inc. has faced regulatory actions and legal challenges from customers and competitors. As part of the legal process, Stassen Exports presented interrogatories to the Plaintiff, seeking clarifications on various matters. They were whether Apple Inc. sells any food or beverage products, specifically tea, if Apple Inc. has a product range involving food, beverages, or tea, if Apple Inc. holds a registration for the apple mark under Class 30 of the International Classification, whether Apple Inc. has faced consumer lawsuits or regulatory actions in the past decade, if there were such cases, details and outcomes of these legal actions, whether Apple Inc. settled a litigation by agreeing to pay up to USD 500 million in relation to older iPhones’ performance, awareness of specific news articles pertaining to Apple Inc.’s actions and fines, whether French antitrust regulators fined Apple Inc. for anti-competitive behaviour and familiarity with news articles on Apple Inc.’s disputes over trademarks in China and Australia. Despite repeated postponements to respond, Apple Inc. failed to provide answers within the allocated timeframe. On 31 July 2023, the Plaintiff informed the Court of their inability to produce an affidavit to address the interrogatories. Consequently, the Court dismissed Apple Inc.’s action and ordered them to pay penalty costs for their failure to respond to the Defendant’s inquiries. In the courtroom, President’s Counsel Dr. Harsha Cabraal represented Apple Inc., accompanied by Nishan Premathiratne, Attorney-at-Law from Julius & Creasy, Attorneys at Law. On the side of Stassen Exports, President’s Counsel Nihal Fernando was assisted by Harshula Seneviratne, Attorney-at-Law, under the guidance of Upendra Gunasekera, Attorney-at-Law."

In response, the TNA MPs underscored that even in well-developed nations like the UK and India, the devolution of powers had been executed exceptionally well. They explained that similar systems utilised in those countries could be adapted for implementation in Sri Lanka as well. In response, Minister Alles highlighted the marked differences in Sri Lanka’s political and social culture compared to those nations and said it was necessary to explore alternative approaches to addressing the concerns raised by the TNA, without resorting to devolving Police powers.

The TNA MPs conveyed the challenges they encountered in travelling long distances from their districts to Colombo for the implementation of decisions made by district committees.

Additionally, the President announced plans to initiate negotiations for the establishment of free trade agreements with corresponding ASEAN member countries. President Wickremesinghe’s statement underscores the country’s determination to bolster its economic connectivity within the broader Asian region. The President affirmed his alignment with the future vision of ASEAN for the Indo-Pacific area, pledging full support for the advancement of this strategic perspective, the PMD said. These proposed collaborations highlight Sri Lanka’s commitment to fostering economic cooperation and trade linkages, which are poised to open new avenues for growth and development. The President’s statements reaffirm the nation’s readiness to engage actively in regional economic partnerships to realise its economic ambitions. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks while addressing the 56th anniversary of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) onTuesday (8) at the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, Colombo, according to the PMD. The President reflected on Sri Lanka’s economic history and the decisions that had impacted the nation’s progress. He acknowledged the efforts of former President J. R. Jayawardene, his father and other influential figures who advocated for opening up the economy and joining ASEAN during its founding years as well as the Shenoy reforms for liberalisation of the economy and to ensure the welfare programme stayed within the needs. The President remarked that turning down the opportunity to join ASEAN led to a period of socialist economic policies and limited capital formations, hindering the country’s growth potential. The President further explained the circumstance that converted into a source of profound regret. He said subsequently, over a span of three years, Sri Lanka transitioned into a socialist economic model, leading to the fragmentation of the capital formations, and has continued to progress in this trajectory.  “However, we find ourselves not entirely emancipated from the constraints imposed by that economic paradigm. At present, despite being positioned as one of the world’s major economies, poised to potentially ascend to the ranks of the fifth or fourth largest expanding economies, we now confront the disheartening reality of shaking on the brink of bankruptcy after 55 years of existence.” President Ranil Wickremesinghe praised the association’s remarkable growth and success as one of the world’s largest economic blocks. The President also expressed regret that Sri Lanka had declined an invitation to join ASEAN in its early years, citing missed opportunities for economic prosperity. However, he highlighted a new policy approach to collaborate closely with ASEAN to enhance Sri Lanka’s position in the global arena. In light of Sri Lanka’s recent financial challenges and the need for rejuvenation, President Wickremesinghe expressed a renewed commitment to pursue closer ties with ASEAN. “Amid the looming threat of bankruptcy, Sri Lanka has embraced the challenge head-on, aiming to move forward with inspiration drawn from proactive problem-solving approaches. This involves looking at the accomplishments of the ASEAN and enhancing collaboration with the organisation. Consequently, as Sri Lanka faces impending financial challenges, it is actively strengthening its bonds with ASEAN nations,” he said. One of the key aspects of the new policy is the initiation of free trade agreements with ASEAN countries. President Wickremesinghe revealed that Sri Lanka has already forged a crucial trade agreement with Singapore and is actively negotiating with Thailand. The President also announced that Sri Lanka has applied to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), recognising the potential of this vast trade block comprising major economies like China, Japan, and Korea. He urged the Minister of Foreign Affairs to facilitate regular ministerial-level meetings with ASEAN countries to address mutual concerns and discuss the way forward. He stressed the importance of upholding the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific and supporting Indonesia’s maritime fulcrum concept. He also called for joint efforts between ASEAN countries and Sri Lanka to combat climate change and explore the potential of the blue economy.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/11/boc-pledges-rs-5b-at-12-for-sme-startup-loan-scheme/,BOC pledges Rs 5B at 12% for SME/ Startup loan scheme,Author not found,0,2023-08-10T20:33:00+00:00," The Bank of Ceylon (BOC), a State-owned banking giant, yesterday unveiled a groundbreaking endeavour aimed at revitalising the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector and propelling rural development. This innovative initiative comprises a pioneering SME and startup loan scheme, underpinned by a substantial fund of five billion rupees and a notable expansion of the acclaimed ‘BOC Gammana’ rural development programme. In a resolute commitment to address the pressing needs of SMEs and marginalised rural communities, the Bank of Ceylon is embarking on a transformative journey. Ronald C. Perera, Chairman of the Bank of Ceylon, expressed the institution’s unwavering dedication, “We firmly believe in the transformative power of entrepreneurship and are steadfastly committed to uplifting our nation’s SMEs and rural areas. This initiative comes with lowered interest rates, offering significant benefits to the vital SME sector, thereby fostering growth.” Perera provided insights into the initiative, explaining, “Our recent undertaking involves a substantial allocation of five billion rupees aimed at stimulating entrepreneurship. The core objective of this venture is to empower both established MSME/SME entrepreneurs and nascent start-ups.” The allocated fund designates four billion rupees to bolster existing entrepreneurs, while a dedicated one billion rupees has been earmarked to foster the growth of start-ups. Start-up enterprises stand to access funds up to two million rupees, while established businesses can secure loans up to Rs 25 million. The offered interest rates for these loans range between 12% and 12.5% per annum, contingent upon the collateral provided by the loan applicant. Significantly, these interest rates are markedly below the current prime lending rate, which stands at 17%. Addressing the SME community, the Chairman issued a resounding call to action, urging entrepreneurs to seize the array of financial and non-financial assistance offered by the bank. He highlighted the tangible relief arising from prudent Domestic debt management under the government’s Domestic debt optimisation process, translating into reduced interest rates that will offer crucial support to SMEs and exporters. With fervour, the Chairman invited SMEs to harness these facilities and opportunities, amplifying their contributions to the nation’s economic trajectory. Russell Fonseka, the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of Ceylon, delineated the bank’s strategic vision. He underscored the institution’s unwavering commitment to support viable projects extending beyond traditional trading and leasing. This inclusive approach encompasses a spectrum of sectors, including agriculture, forestry, fisheries, industry-based ventures, and other service-oriented enterprises. Notably, the bank places a special emphasis on promoting women-led businesses, recognising the indispensable role women play in advancing the nation’s economic landscape. In the midst of prevailing economic headwinds, the Bank of Ceylon remains steadfast in its commitment to fortify the SME sector. Acknowledging the pivotal role SMEs play in a nation’s economic advancement, the Chairman emphasised, “The SME sector is the backbone of economic development in any country.” To underscore this commitment, the bank has introduced a series of measures aimed at bolstering the SME ecosystem: – Grace Period for Loan Repayments: In acknowledgment of the far-reaching impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the bank has extended a grace period for loan repayments, extending crucial relief to struggling businesses.  – Concessionary Loan Schemes: The bank has introduced a suite of concessional loan schemes, including MELOC, Emergency Response, SMILE III, and Tea Loan, tailored exclusively for SMEs. These schemes offer favorable interest rates and terms.  -Non-Financial Assistance: The bank goes beyond financial aid, providing non-financial support through initiatives like SME Circle, which facilitates vital connections between SMEs and institutions such as the Export Development Board, Small Enterprises Development, and Industrial Development Board. – Skills Development Programmes: The Bank of Ceylon has pioneered skill development programmes aimed at enhancing financial literacy, fostering entrepreneurship, and nurturing financial management skills among SMEs. – Micro Financing for Rural Communities: The ‘BOC Mithru’ program continues to be a beacon of support, elevating rural living standards through micro-financing initiatives. At the heart of the bank’s corporate social responsibility lies the ‘BOC Gammana’ programme, an initiative designed to uplift deserving villages across each province in Sri Lanka. Several villages, including Medirigirya-Tissa Amuna, Mandram Nuwara-Hunukotuwa, Mullaithivu-Thirthkarai, Dehiovita-Meegasthanna, Nawagattegama-Kuruketiyawa, and Ella-Maduragma, have already experienced the transformative effects of this comprehensive programme. Under the ‘BOC Gammana’ banner, multifaceted development initiatives encompass education, self-employment, healthcare, and community engagement. The bank has been instrumental in establishing computer laboratories in schools, reviving libraries, promoting home gardening, organising maternity clinics, and launching other progressive projects. The Bank of Ceylon envisions the expansion of the ‘BOC Gammana’ initiative, with plans to select one village from each province for future development phases. Galle-Katandola, Nittabuwa-Attanagalla-Allawala, and Kantale-Rajawala have been earmarked as the chosen villages for the forthcoming stages of this programme. As the Bank of Ceylon strides forward with its visionary initiatives, it reaffirms its pivotal role in propelling SMEs and fostering holistic socio-economic progress throughout Sri Lanka.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the domestic US intelligence agency, said its agents attempted to serve search and arrest warrants early on Wednesday to the residence of Craig Robertson in Provo, Utah, South of Salt Lake City. Unnamed law enforcement sources told The Associated Press that Robertson was armed when the incident took place. The FBI released a statement saying the shooting was under review. “The FBI takes all shooting incidents involving our agents or task force members seriously,” the agency said. The shooting comes amid increased fears of political violence in the US, particularly in the wake of the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. At the time of his death, Robertson faced three felony counts, including making interstate threats, making threats against the president and influencing, impeding and retaliating against federal law enforcement officers by threat. The criminal complaint against him highlighted social media posts Robertson made expressing violent desires towards the perceived enemies of former Republican President Donald Trump. The filings allege that Robertson took to Facebook on Monday to say he had learned of Biden’s visit to Utah and would need to “clean the dust off the M24 sniper rifle”. Biden stopped in Utah on Wednesday, as part of a trip through the western United States. In a previous post, in September 2022, Robertson allegedly wrote, “The time is right for a presidential assassination or two. First Joe then Kamala!!!” Bragg, the District Attorney, who filed the first criminal indictment against Trump in New York, was also a target, according to the Court filings. The FBI said it had been warned about Robertson’s activities in March after he posted on the platform Truth Social about wanting to “put a nice hole in his [Bragg’s] forehead”. Online, Robertson described himself as a “MAGA Trumper”, referring to the acronym for Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again”. Details about the circumstances surrounding Robertson’s death have yet to be released. But the shooting has drawn attention to the ongoing threat of political violence in the US. A report published by the Reuters news agency on Wednesday said that the US is currently experiencing political violence on a level unseen since the 1970s, with much of it driven by the far-right.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The first phase of 300 MW was commissioned in 2011, and the second and third in 2014. The total power generation capacity of this Plant is 900 Megawatt with an estimated cost of the project being USD 1.35 billion. The Contract for the construction and commissioning of the Plant was awarded to the China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). This is a Chinese State-owned enterprise. The Project was partly funded by the Exim Bank of China. This came in the form of two Loans, USD 300 million on terms of 20 years to maturity, five years grace and a rate of two per cent interest per annum. The Second loan of USD 155 million was a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period and six per cent interest. In simple layman’s terms, since the end of the grace period in 2019, our monthly payments on the Chinese borrowing of USD 455 million is approximately USD 4.25 million per month or Rs 1,360,000,000 per month. This is in addition to paying back the balance borrowing on the total project cost of USD 1.35 billion. I personally have no idea what the Warranty terms of this project were, nor do I want to speculate on inferior equipment used. However, the industry norm is that Coal Power plants are stable and rarely break down. Also, they have life spans of over 50-60 years. In this instance, I will even let the fact that these Coal power plants are extremely harmful to the environment slip. At this point what bothers me most is that who does the buck stop with here? The CEB had a senior technical team that signed off on this project, maybe it’s time the names of this high-level technical evaluation committee were revealed to the public and some accountability be sought out, even through our solid judiciary system in Sri Lanka. If it is found that the Chinese Government owned entity that was awarded the contract did indeed supply inferior equipment then like the much spoken about Express Pearl, they should be sued and compensation sought. Or maybe the generous Chinese Government who are continually looking for ways to help the people of Sri Lanka, should at least right off their component of US$ 455 million loan used for this project.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/11/many-experts-lobbied-politicians-political-parties/,"‘Many experts lobbied politicians, political parties’",Author not found,0,2023-08-10T20:32:00+00:00," At the meeting of the Select Committee of Parliament to Investigate Causes for Financial Bankruptcy in April 2022, declared by the Government and to Report to Parliament and Submit its Proposals and Recommendations that was held recently, numerous participants, including professors from all Sri Lankan universities and economists highlighted several significant concerns and reasons. They pointed out that the influence exerted by various individuals lobbying for political parties and politicians had emerged as a noticeable contributing factor to the financial bankruptcy of the country. The committee was chaired by SLPP MP Sagara Kariyawasam. During the committee session, a Professor of Economics from the Department of Economics and Statistics at the University of Peradeniya, W.L. Prasanna Perera, highlighted that the economy was grappling with structural challenges and had repeatedly ignored early warning signals from both internal and external indicators since the conclusion of the war. The Professor elaborated on the presence of twin deficits. The Government’s spending, driven by the need to maintain a low productivity level, exceeded its revenue due to the complexity of the tax system. Moreover, there was a notable discrepancy between imports and exports, with the external sector primarily reliant on non-tradable earnings. He also highlighted that the real GDP growth rates were as follows: 8.5 per cent during 2010-2012, 4.4 per cent during 2013-2015, 3.6 per cent during 2016-2018, and 2.6 per cent during 2019-2021. In terms of the debt-service ratio, it stood at 16.5 per cent during 2010-2012, increased to 25.6 per cent during 2013-2015, further rose to 26.1 per cent during 2016-2018, and reached 31.8 per cent during 2019-2021. He also raised concerns about debt-driven unproductive mega-scale projects that lacked proper feasibility or procurement processes. He pointed out the rise in non-concessional loans after 2009, replacing the previously low-cost Government foreign borrowings with higher-cost ones due to limited access to concessional funding. Moreover, he emphasised that the previous Government’s economic mismanagement was evident. He also noted that the ban on imported chemical fertilisers: impact on tea and paddy, domestic agriculture (Loss of agricultural output + further decreases the export earning) also was one of the factors. There was also the fixing USD value USD 1 = Rs 203 (sacrificed foreign reserves, downgraded credit rating) which hampered the progress and the exhaustion of all debt management strategies without foreign or domestic financing except dependence on Central Bank money printing. He pointed out that the Easter Sunday bombing in April 2019, and the pandemic that followed further deteriorated tourism earnings and remittances, he added. He also stressed the Russia-Ukraine war in early 2022 – fuel prices and general price level and also there is continuous downgrading by rating agencies. Pointing to the level of corruption in Sri Lanka where in 2002 Sri Lanka ranked 52 and in 2021 at 102, and the bureaucratic system with non-market-driven public also had a say. He stressed that the policies discouraged foreign and local investment. He said, Debt to Repay: Total USD 91 billion (Foreign 36 billion – ISBs 13.574 billion); Average USD 5 billion per year, 2026 – USD 25 billion (Debt has reached an unsustainable level in the past two years due to the debt servicing challenges amidst low revenue mobilisation and limited foreign inflows to the country). Foreign reserves by announcing the bankruptcy: a significant depletion of gross official reserves after 2019 and that the USD 7.6 billion in 2019 and USD 1.97 billion (usable amount only around USD 400 million) in March 2022, he added. Professor Aminda Perera, representing Wayamba University, brought to attention a distinct divergence within the country’s financial and economic experts regarding the Light Rail Project.

Rangebandara expressed disappointment that Opposition Leader Premadasa, who was nurtured within President Wickremesinghe’s political camp for the past 20 years, has now become one of his primary adversaries without displaying any gratitude or respect for him. He remarked that both Opposition Leader Premadasa and the JVP appeared poised to exploit any problem arising in the country for their political gains, effectively creating chaos rather than offering practical solutions. Rangebandara criticised these shortsighted and politically bankrupt practices, suggesting they seem to be perpetually ongoing. He noted that both factions lack common sense and are resorting to using natural disasters as a means to remain relevant in politics, as it appears to be their sole weapon at present. While emphasising that the Government has taken comprehensive steps to enhance the nation’s resilience in the face of potential disasters, Rangebandara revealed the establishment of a committee led by UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene. This committee will conduct research into potential natural disasters that might occur in Sri Lanka, particularly in conjunction with heavy rainfall or drought conditions. He underscored the Government’s collaboration with the global community to minimise the adverse impacts of natural disasters. He asserted that the current drought situation is a natural phenomenon and neither the Government nor the authorities can be held responsible. He emphasised the Government’s commitment to safeguarding the populace, including farmers, through its actions. He criticised Premadasa and the JVP for exploiting issues faced by Udawalawa farmers for their own political gain, characterising such actions as contrary to the conduct of a genuine and people-friendly politician. He cast doubt on the intentions of these factions, suggesting they might be attempting to recreate the critical situation that occurred the previous year, potentially resulting in further loss of innocent lives.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/11/electricity-reforms-bill-signals-erosion-of-consumer-rights/,Electricity Reforms Bill signals erosion of consumer rights,Author not found,0,2023-08-10T20:32:00+00:00," Former Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Chairman Janaka Ratnayake alleged that the proposed Electricity Reforms Bill’s provisions signal the erosion of electricity consumer rights. Under the proposed legislation, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) would undergo a transformation into 15 distinct private companies, a move that Ratnayake believes will have far-reaching implications. In a media briefing held on Tuesday (8), Ratnayake raised alarms about the potential loss of Rs 200 million in electricity security deposits for consumers and the dismantling of the consumer complaints and dispute resolution mechanism. The ramifications of these changes could be significant for electricity users across the nation. One of the most contentious aspects of the proposed bill involves the fate of CEB personnel. He said, the legislation’s stipulation that all CEB employees would be integrated into roles within the newly formed private enterprises. This lack of choice removes the ability for employees to exercise personal discretion, essentially nullifying their privileges as CEB workers. The bill’s framers have put both the electricity consumer and the CEB employee in a challenging situation, leaving them with diminished agency and control over their circumstances. He further stressed the importance of empowering employees to make informed decisions about their employment and compensation before the CEB’s dissolution. The impending transformation of this major public institution into private entities necessitates careful consideration of the implications for all stakeholders involved. He also added, the Minister of Power and Energy gets the power to decide electricity tariffs and that the EPF, ETF and pension of CEB employees will be under a private company. Another criticism was that if the new bill is enacted, all hydropower plants, coal power plants and thermal power plants will be under separate private companies. Ratnayake explained further that the proposed draft lacks any provision related to the handling of the Rs 200 million deposits by the electricity consumers. “According to Section 28 of the existing Sri Lanka Electricity Act, a clear provision mandates that electricity consumers are liable to get an interest on the security deposit. Presently, the cumulative sum of these deposited funds exceeds Rs 200 million. However, the new proposed legislation conspicuously overlooks the safeguarding of this security deposit, leaving uncertainties about the fate of this substantial amount unaddressed within the draft. Additionally, the prevailing legislation endows the PUCSL with the authority to safeguard the rights of electricity consumers. The current framework also establishes an effective mechanism to efficiently manage consumer grievances and conflicts through the PUCSL. This empowers consumers to seek resolutions for their complaints and concerns promptly and equitably, obviating the need for legal proceedings. Unfortunately, the proposed bill eradicates these rights, amenities, and protections, placing consumers in a vulnerable position in relation to private entities,” he stressed. Ratnayake also claimed that the authority to set electricity rates is slated to be transferred to the Power Minister as per the provisions of the proposed bill. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Speaker announced to Parliament the Supreme Court decision regarding the petition filed by PAFFREL against the amendment proposed to the Local Government Ordinance by MP Jayantha Katagoda to reinstate former Councillors of dissolved LG bodies. The Private Members Bills presented by Katagoda were inconsistent with the Constitution and need a majority in Parliament and a referendum to be enacted. “This judgment is a great victory achieved in recent history by the people who value democracy in Sri Lanka. Also it is envisaged to achieve similar victories in respect of the other petitions filed by the PAFFREL and other parties in the Supreme Court in relation to the postponement of Local Government Elections arbitrarily. Despite there being a recent tendency among politicians to abuse parliamentary power and undermine democratic values to consolidate their power, this judgment emphasises that such practices could not be continued any longer,” PAFFREL said in a statement. PAFFREL said, it has repeatedly expressed its protest against the people’s representatives holding onto office beyond the time limit they were elected for by the people and the Councillors acting in an arbitrary and undemocratic manner. The petition was filed on 12 July where Katagoda and the Attorney General the named as respondents in the case. “The decision of the Supreme Court on this petition which has been referred to the Speaker included  that the Clause 2 of all three amendments proposed namely the Pradeshiya Sabha Act (Amendment), Urban Councils Ordinance (Amendment)’ and the Municipal Councils Ordinance (Amendment) which were challenged before the Supreme Court was inconsistent with Articles 1, 12 (1), 82, 83 and 104B of the Constitution, and therefore, the Supreme Court has decided that all three bills should be passed by a special majority in Parliament and also approved by the people in a referendum according to the provisions of Article 83 of the Constitution.” BY Sanjana Marzook"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

Addressing a media at the Health Ministry, with regard to Dedunu Dias–led expert committee, appointed to probe the incidents of Anaphylaxis to drugs in several hospitals islandwide, the Professor in Immunology, Allergy and Molecular Medicine at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura noted that although the expert committee had not been tasked with looking into or testing medicinal drugs, the committee had referred to all the quality reports available.  “It should be mentioned that all suspected drugs were sent for quality testing and most of the reports were available for our assessment so it was easy for us to make recommendations based on those reports,” he said. He said, the action taken by the Ministry of Health, with regard to the controversy caused by medicinal drug allergies, is sufficient. “Contrary to what has been reported by the media, only two patients have died due to allergies, while others who experienced allergic reactions are still alive. Not all patients who experience allergies from medicinal drugs end up dying. The expert committee conducted its investigation using internationally recognised methods,” he said. Fielding questions regarding the quality testing, which had been carried out by the NMRA’s Quality Assurance Laboratory, he said, the two drugs considered had been Co-amoxiclav and Ceftriaxone. The latter drug was received from two suppliers, one from Germany and India. He noted that the antibiotic from South India had been used in local State-run hospitals for a long period. According to the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) more than 400,000 doses had been distributed to hospitals Islandwide without a problem till the recent death, following the administration of the drug, that was recorded, Prof. Jeewandara explained, adding that both the brands of the drug received from the two companies had been tested at the NMRA while both passed the quality test according to reports.   However, a batch of Co-amoxiclav brand Manufactured in Sri Lanka, tested by the NMRA Quality Assurance Lab, was not available at the time but they had a report from a different batch which noted that particles had been detected in the vials so that particular drug had failed in quality testing.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/11/ministry-accepts-dr-haq-cannot-continue-working/,Ministry accepts Dr. Haq cannot continue working,Author not found,0,2023-08-10T20:31:00+00:00," The Health Ministry yesterday (10) accepted that Medical Practitioner, Dr. Ruhul Haq could not continue to work in a Health Ministry institution, when his registration had been suspended by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), for a period of eight months. Dr. Haq’s name sparked controversy following post-mortem into the death of a child at Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Colombo following a kidney surgery. He also performed the post-mortem on businessman Dinesh Schaffter, that was labelled as contradictory by the Schaffter family lawyer. Fielding questions during a media briefing, Director Tertiary Care Services Dr. Priyatha Atapattu said, according to SLMC rules and regulations he could not practice as a medical officer. However, he noted that a person could continue in service following a Court decision. However, the Health Ministry has initiated a probe into the matter, he said.  “But since he is a JMO he could challenge these words in a Court of Law, therefore, we have given him instructions to work in accordance with SLMC provisions, he noted.  Dr. Atapattu noted however, that the Health Ministry too would act in accordance of the legal advice it received with regard to JMO Dr. Haq, he said adding that the Ministry was in the process of taking action in this regard. The SLMC had written to the Health Ministry informing it of an eight-month suspension on Judicial Medical Officer Dr. Ruhul Haq’s registration owing to an incident which had taken place 14 years earlier, at the District General Hospital Nuwara Eliya, Dr. Atapattu explained. As the Competent Authority, the Director General Health Services informed his superior at the Colombo JMO’s Office of the SLMC’s recommendations. Therefore it is the head of the Colombo JMO’s Office that should take action, he noted. He explained that even if the SLMC imposed a temporary suspension on his registration, Dr, Haq has the right to appeal. “We do not know what action he took but we have taken action in accordance with the SLMC’s communiqué to the Health Ministry, the Director Medical Services noted. Dr. Atapattu said in his preliminary letter to the JMO he had informed him that action was being taken with regard to his eight-month suspension. Also the particular medical practitioner was informed of the Ministry’s stance earlier this week. Fielding questions he noted that there were provisions in the Establishment Code regarding what action could be taken when an authoritative body such as the SLMC suspended the registration of a medical practitioner.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/10/report-on-recent-drug-allergies-submitted/,Report on recent drug allergies submitted,Author not found,0,2023-08-09T20:36:00+00:00," The Expert Committee chaired by Director of the Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Dedunu Dias to probe recent incidents of drug allergies and their after-effects submitted its report to Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella at the Health Ministry.  The report noted that of the six cases analysed in detail, five had met the anaphylaxis criteria, which is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurred swiftly. Among the five patients who had anaphylaxis, the causality assessment using WHO-UMC (World Health Organization – Uppsala Monitoring Centre) causality assessment criteria categorised four adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as probable due to the suspected drug. The 12 recommendations submitted by the Dedunu Committee include revisiting and establishing national and institutional guidelines/ protocols on anaphylaxis management/ emergency management. The re-emphasis of the practice of early recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis and immediate treatment with adrenalin while authorising the registered nursing officers of institutions to use 1:1000 adrenalin in the IM route in an emergency without the directions of medical officers. The Committee also recommended developing a mandatory continuous professional development mechanism or training programme for medical officers and nursing officers on emergency management of anaphylaxis. They called for a compulsory mechanism to conduct institutional clinical audits for all life-threatening adverse incidents reported to be instituted. Revision of the terms of reference of the Drug Therapeutic Committee (TOR of DTC) to include the development of institutional drug management policies (ex: Institutional Antibiotic policy, ADR audit policy, etc.) and to introduce institutional mechanisms to minimise medication errors. They noted that a network or pathways should be established for anaphylaxis survivors for subsequent allergy reviews. Also, a mechanism should be set up to educate year 10 and 11 students at schools from across the country on allergies and the safe use of medicines/antibiotics. A similar mechanism should be established to educate media personnel and the public also on the matter. The Dedunu report called for the improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of ADRs reporting and response system by the introduction of real-time data-sharing mobile applications while permitting the public to report ADRs to the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA). The Committee also recommended taking speedy remedial action on procedural and/or financial issues that hinder the adequate supply of safe and effective drugs of acceptable quality to healthcare institutions. While the Health Minister observed on Twitter that the full report could not be published due to Doctor-patient confidentiality, the Academy of Health Professionals (AHP) urged the Ministry to take measures to publicise the report “as it was the only time the Health Ministry accepted that there was a fault in the State Health service and appointed a Committee to probe it.” Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said on Twitter that while the Dr. Dedunu Dias Committee had officially submitted the report to him on Tuesday (8) the full report can’t be fully disclosed due to doctor-patient confidentiality.” But conclusions and recommendations, which are now part of public records, have been officially released, he said on Twitter.   President of the AHP, Ravi Kumudesh said the medicinal drug issue in healthcare accounted for only one per cent of the country’s health problems. Although the Dedunu Committee could not be expected to soothe overall health issues in the island, it was the only time when a study was conducted on the country’s health service and therefore the public needed to be made aware of the findings. He noted that the Expert Committee that studied the issue had not been able to do a technical or laboratory study. Is there any other option but to accept the information given by the relevant expert team regarding the professional errors that may occur in the pre- and post-procedure observed for the patient. Kumudesh alleged that the expert study had been limited to the refrigeration, distribution and post-marketing process that takes place after the delivery of the medicine. However, there is no account of how many medicinal drugs were studied, how many cases were studied, and what percentage of them were defective, as this is the most important information that can be revealed by this report. The AHP President urged the Health Ministry to disclose details in the entire report immediately. Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe, responding to queries, said the report submitted by the Dedunu Committee had completely overlooked the issue which they had meant to address thereby the report that was submitted to the Health Minister was still incomplete. The Committee seems to have forgotten that there was a deep-rooted question regarding the quality of the medicinal drugs which had been used during the procedure of patient treatment. They seem to have completely overlooked the fact as to whether the anaphylaxis which they spoke of at length was a result of the drug quality itself. Therefore, the Dr. Dedunu Dias report was incomplete sans the report on the medicinal drugs that had been used to treat these patients. Also, the public was yet to know if the parties affected by the drug-related incidents were given justice. Minister Rambukwella spoke of compensation earlier when the incidences occurred but there were questions as to whose money he was going to use in paying that compensation, Dr. Wijesinghe pointed out. Minister Rambukwella on Twitter also noted he was awaiting the results of a quality test of the reported drug after a “thorough, independent exam by the National Drug Quality Assurance Laboratory.” He noted that it had been the reason for him to discuss the matter with President Ranil Wickremesinghe to set up a WHO-funded Benchmark lab to qualitatively expedite such queries.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/10/courts-have-no-jurisdiction-over-parliament-speaker/,Courts have no Jurisdiction over Parliament – Speaker,Author not found,0,2023-08-09T20:33:00+00:00," Regarding the Petitions lodged against the approved Parliament resolution on Domestic Debt Restructuring, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene said yesterday (9) that no Court under Sri Lanka’s Constitution has the authority to issue orders or judgments against a resolution that has already garnered Parliamentary approval. This ruling was in response to a privilege concern raised by Minister Harin Fernando on the previous day (8). Minister Fernando sought a ruling from the Speaker to determine whether the petitions filed in court against the resolution for domestic debt restructuring were a breach of parliamentary privilege and the legislature itself. The Speaker said, “Article 4 (C) of Sri Lanka’s Constitution outlines that “the judicial power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament through courts, tribunals and institutions established by or recognised under the Constitution, or established by law. This holds true except for matters concerning the privileges, immunities, and powers of Parliament and its Members, where the judicial power of the People may be directly exercised by Parliament according to the law.” The Speaker said Article 148 of the Constitution grants Parliament full control over public finance. It specifies that no tax, rate, or levy can be imposed by any local or public authority without the authorisation of a law passed by Parliament. “I would like to first state that the Cabinet of Ministers unanimously endorsed the Domestic Debt Optimization plan proposed by the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation, and National Policies during a special Cabinet meeting on 28 June 2023. Subsequently, the resolution for implementing the Domestic Debt Optimisation to restore sovereign debt sustainability received approval from the Parliament’s Committee on Public Finance on 30 June 2023, with a majority vote by Committee Members.” “Since the subject matter of the mentioned resolution predominantly concerns public finance, the Resolution for implementing the Domestic Debt Optimisation to restore sovereign debt sustainability was ratified by Parliament on July 1, 2023, with a majority vote of 122 Members in favor and 62 against.” “As the resolution for implementing the Domestic Debt Optimisation to restore sovereign debt sustainability has been officially passed by Parliament on July 1, 2023, it falls outside the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or any other court established under the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka. Thus, it cannot be contested, reviewed, or challenged.” “A ruling issued on 20 June 2001, by Speaker of Parliament Anura Bandaranaike unequivocally established that court interference with parliamentary proceedings is not permissible. The ruling stated that the Supreme Court lacks the jurisdiction to issue interim orders restraining the Speaker of Parliament with regard to actions authorised by Standing Order 78A. Furthermore, the interim order from the Supreme Court is not binding and holds no legal obligation to comply.” “Consequently, no court established under Sri Lanka’s Constitution has the authority to issue orders or judgments against a resolution that has already undergone due parliamentary processes and been approved by Parliament. Any such court order or judgment would constitute a violation of item 01 of Part B of the Parliament (Powers & Privileges) Act, No. 21 of 1953 (as amended).” By Methmalie Dissanayake"

After changing the laws regarding Provincial Councils and making new rules, if the Parliament agrees to change the Provincial Council Voting Act, this would include voting based on the District Proportional System, the President said.

The President said following on how many women should be in these Councils, they will commence planning for Elections in these councils. He said the establishment of a committee, headed by the Prime Minister, will be pursued to re-evaluate the powers assigned to the central government, the functions assigned to Provincial Councils, and the shared responsibilities stipulated in the Constitution. The resulting amendments will be proposed, garnering the support of all parties in Parliament. Furthermore, he highlighted the intent to establish an advisory council to offer guidance to provincial governors until the Provincial Councils begin operations. Noting the role of Provincial Councils within the governance structure and political landscape of the country, the President emphasised the opportunity to effect a substantial transformation in constructing an effective, transparent, and corrupt-free Provincial Council system that commands public trust and addresses citizen concerns. The President acknowledged the challenges in reaching consensus, particularly with sensitive matters like police powers during the devolution of authority to Provincial Councils under the 13th Amendment. He underscored the importance of unity in executing these initiatives."

The Petition was filed by Attorney-at-Law Sunil Watagala on behalf of the Inter-Company Employees’ Union, its President Wasantha Samarasinghe and six others. The petitioners sought an order from Court preventing the Government from waiving off the loans obtained from the EPF and ETF during the Domestic Debt Optimisation process. However, the Supreme Court today dismissed the petition without taking it up for hearing. The Supreme Court yesterday (9) rejected a petition that aimed to stop the Government from canceling loans acquired from the EPF and ETF funds during the process of restructuring domestic debt. The petition was filed by Attorney-at-Law Sunil Watagala on behalf of the Inter-Company Employees’ Union, along with its President Wasantha Samarasinghe and six others. They sought an order to prevent the Government from waiving off loans taken from the EPF and ETF during the Domestic Debt Optimisation process. The petitioners argued that a large portion of the money (93% of EPF deposits and 86% of ETF deposits) has been invested in government Treasury Bills and Central Bank bonds. They also claim that the Government’s decision to waive these loans taken from their EPF and ETF was unfair by the working community of around 20 million people. Therefore, the petitioners asked the Supreme Court to declare that the Government’s actions would infringe upon the fundamental rights of the working people, if the loans reduced these funds during domestic debt restructuring and requested an interim order to halt this action."

Speaking to Ceylon Today, Stalin pointed out that the selected candidate for the post of principal at Royal College did not attend the interview nor submitted any transfer applications. Stalin said the post of principal at Royal College in Colombo became vacant from yesterday (9), and there are allegations that a person with ties to former Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam is being considered for the post. CTU has decided to collaborate with other education trade unions to institute legal action against the move to appoint a principal who wasn’t even interviewed. Additionally, he alleged that appointments for new principals are planned without finalising the transfers of principals in five prominent schools in the country. These schools include Royal College, Colombo, D.S. Senanayake College, Colombo, Mahanama College, Colombo, Mahinda Rajapaksa College, Homagama, and Kuliyapitiya Central College. These principals were not included in the transfer list. He said interviews were conducted to select principals for 34 prominent schools, and this list has been forwarded to the Public Service Commission (PSC) for approval. However, the five principals mentioned in the initial list were absent from the PSC’s list. As a result, the initial list was rejected, and the PSC instructed to send the complete list. Even in the second list sent to the PSC, the above-mentioned schools were not mentioned. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

The Speaker of the Sri Lankan Parliament, Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers, Ambassadors/High Commissioners, Members of Parliament, the President’s Chief of Staff, the Chief of Sri Lanka Defence Staff, the Commander of the Sri Lanka Tri Forces, religious leaders, and other VIPs were also present. At her opening remarks, the Indonesian Ambassador, Dewi Gustina Tobing, on behalf of ASEAN Heads of Missions, enlightened the guests that commemorating the ASEAN Day commenced when fifty-six years ago, on 8 August 1967, five leaders – the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand – sat down together in the main Hall of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building in Bangkok, Thailand, and signed the document on the establishment of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Since then, ASEAN has succeeded in building the Southeast Asian region as an economically, politically, and culturally integrated region. Ambassador Dewi further notified that Indonesia is the Chairman of ASEAN for 2023 and carried the theme “ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth”. With that theme, ASEAN countries would ensure that ASEAN remains and is increasingly strengthening its central role and being the centre of growth to make ASEAN significant and relevant to the ASEAN community and the world. ASEAN will continue to work closely with Sri Lanka. In the meantime, in his keynote remarks, President Ranil Wickremesinghe appraised the development and the central role of ASEAN and was keen to have a closer collaboration with ASEAN, given the strong ties between Sri Lanka and Southeast Asian countries. The President emphasised that collaborating more closely with ASEAN was one of his government’s policies whereby Sri Lanka could build more advanced political, economic, and cultural relations as well as expressed his intention for Sri Lanka to join the ASEAN-RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership). The President also underscored that the Sri Lankan Government supported the concept of the ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific and hoped there would be an increase in trade, investment, and tourists from ASEAN countries that benefit Sri Lanka’s economic development. The Annual ASEAN Day is celebrated in all Member States and at diplomatic missions, including the ASEAN Missions in Sri Lanka. Since its formation, ASEAN has succeeded in building the Southeast Asian region as an economically, politically, and culturally integrated region while upholding the principle of maintaining the centrality and proactive role of ASEAN in its relations with its external partners. It was also noted that Sri Lanka’s major exports to the region consisted of apparel, electrical machinery, natural pearls, and tea. Sri Lanka joined the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 2007 and was a signatory to the ASEAN’s Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in the same year. The Celebration of the 56th ASEAN Day consisted of two activities, namely the hoisting of the ASEAN Flag by three of the Indonesian Embassy’s personnel and followed by a Cocktail Reception at the Riptaloka Hall, whereby all guests tasted ASEAN countries’ traditional cuisine."

The event’s inaugural session on Sunday saw the convergence of minds and ideas, marking the beginning of a week-long exploration into the world of Arbitration. The event’s curtain raiser was none other than Sulaiman Rameez, the Convenor of Colombo Arbitration Week. In his Welcome Address, Rameez set the tone for the upcoming discussions. He laid out the overarching goals of the Colombo Arbitration Week, deftly shedding light on the unique challenges and requirements that the local arbitration landscape presents. Notably, he emphasised the event’s commitment to enhancing the status of arbitration in Sri Lanka and positioning the nation as a global focal point for international dispute resolution. Following this introduction, the stage was graced by Malin Herwig, the UNDP Deputy Resident Representative. Her presence underscored the international recognition and support that Sri Lanka’s ‘Arbitration’ endeavours have garnered. Herwig delivered remarks that resonated with the audience, particularly highlighting the collaborative partnership between Colombo Arbitration Week 2023 and the Justice Reform (JURE) project. This partnership has undertaken the mission of spearheading the widespread adoption and promotion of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) practices across the length and breadth of Sri Lanka. The evening’s programme unfolded to reveal two pivotal segments that enthralled the attendees. Dr. Romesh Weeramantry, an eminent figure in the realm of Legal and Arbitration circles, delivered an insightful Keynote Address. As a respected authority, Dr. Weeramantry masterfully delved into the steps that Sri Lanka must undertake to solidify its foothold on the Asian Arbitration landscape. With eloquence and precision, he dissected the current Arbitration terrain, deftly highlighting both effective strategies and imminent challenges. His address resonated as a clarion call, urging all stakeholders to rally together, united in purpose, to pave the way for a more robust Arbitration ecosystem within the nation. The event’s narrative then seamlessly transitioned into an engaging Panel Discussion, aptly titled “In Favour of Not Reinventing the Wheel or Chartering Our Own Path?” This session saw the convergence of luminaries who have left an indelible mark on the Arbitration landscape. Justice Janak De Silva, Judge of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, Justice Anselmo Reyes, former Judge of the High Court of Hong Kong, and Eric Ng, the Deputy Registrar of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) covered all possible areas related to the question. During this captivating session, Justice Janak De Silva brought his extensive experience to the fore. He skillfully highlighted the existing gaps within Sri Lanka’s Legal and Arbitration framework, identified several strengths of the proposed Arbitration Act, and invited valuable perspectives from his fellow panellists. The esteemed members of the panel engaged in a riveting dialogue, underscoring the pivotal importance of embracing diversity, assimilating industry best practices, and charting a distinctive trajectory tailored to Sri Lanka’s unique context. A particularly resonant theme emerged during the discussion – the indispensable role of the younger generation in the realm of arbitration. The panellists unanimously stressed the significance of nurturing a culture of innovation and inclusivity, transcending the boundaries of seniority and experience. As the curtains drew on the first day of the Colombo Arbitration Week, a palpable sense of anticipation hung in the air. Participants departed with renewed zeal, eagerly looking forward to the days ahead. The remainder of the week promises an array of thought-provoking topics, expertly explored by luminaries within the field. Notably, an Award Writing Workshop, conducted by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, is scheduled for 10 August. This will be followed by a landmark event – Sri Lanka’s inaugural Practitioners’ Assembly – slated for 12/13 August. As the sun sets on this promising inauguration, the stage is set for a week of inspired dialogue and profound insights, with Colombo Arbitration Week 2023 poised to catalyse fresh vistas of development in the realm of dispute resolution."

In response to this issue, indigenous communities are reminded of their entitlement to chart their own courses and implement decisions in ways that hold significance and align with their cultural values each year on 9 August. The International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples is observed to raise awareness and protect the rights of the world’s indigenous population. This event also recognises the achievements and contributions that indigenous people make to improve world issues such as environmental protection. This year’s International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples themed ‘Indigenous Youth as Agents of Change for Self-Determination,’ acknowledges their dedicated endeavours toward climate action, justice, and underscores the pivotal role of indigenous youth in shaping decisions. Dilena Pathragoda, Executive Director of the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ), said, “World Indigenous Day is commemorated annually on 9 August. In Sri Lanka, this took place in the Kotabakiniya, an Adivasi village located in Damana.” Particularly in Sri Lanka, the Indigenous People’s Day follows the Wariga Sabhawa (assembly) of indigenous people. During this event, indigenous individuals gather from distant areas like Henanigala, Rathugala, Pollebedda, and Wakarei, where the indigenous people reside. The Wariga Sabhawa convened, led by Uruwarige Wannila Aththo, and significant decisions were made by indigenous leaders. In 2022, the CEJ actively participated in this event and took the initiative to distribute a book called ‘Wedi Bhashawa’ (Indigenous Language) within their community. This book holds great significance for the indigenous people. Several crucial proposals were put forth during the Tribal Assembly on that day, Pathragoda said. “During the same event, discussions involving government entities such as the Department of Forest Conservation, Department of Wildlife Conservation, Local Government bodies, and Divisional Secretariats took place, focusing on the rights and challenges faced by indigenous communities. These discussions culminated in submitting a memorandum to the Government. While hopes were pinned on finding solutions within a year, the proposals presented last year remain unresolved.” Challenges related to climate change, food security, and environmental degradation must be addressed and deforestation stands out as a pressing threat to this region, Pathragoda said. “Notably, the ‘Galwala Yaya’ reserve in Pollebedda was threatened, prompting legal intervention to prevent over 1,500 acres of land from being used for maize cultivation. Although deforestation has ceased, the ‘Rambakan Oya,’ a water source that serves the area, has become contaminated, posing drinking water concerns. Several measures are imperative to safeguard the well-being and future of indigenous communities, necessitating substantial government intervention,” he pointed out. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Fielding questions during a media briefing on Tuesday (8) Dr. Aluthge said that insulin was an essential for some diabetic patients. “This is a matter of life and death where the required stocks should be obtained through at least government to government intervention via the diplomatic missions,” he urged.  Dr. Aluthge said the Health Minister should not merely pay lip service but should go beyond his words and put an end to emergency purchasing. He accused the Minister of having repeatedly stated that the Ministry would put a stop to emergency purchasing of medicinal drugs. “If the Minister wants to retain his credibility then he should go beyond his words and not just put an abrupt stop to emergency purchasing, but present the necessary agenda on how he proposes to do it, Dr. Aluthge said. The situation is the same with the fast depleting stocks of insulin available in State hospitals. They should not look for ways and means to award the tenders, to their bosom buddies, at a high cost.  Instead of leaving room for the large number of allegations of corruption related to the procurement of insulin, health authorities should intervene and take immediate action to procure necessary stocks as early as possible, he said.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/09/ceb-will-ensure-uninterrupted-power-supply-kanchana/,CEB will ensure uninterrupted power supply– Kanchana,Author not found,0,2023-08-08T20:36:00+00:00," Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will ensure an uninterrupted supply of Power islandwide, as there are no plans to schedule power cuts, despite the breakdown of Unit 2 of Norochcholai power plant and water scarcity in major reservoirs. During a press conference, at the President’s Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (8), he emphasised that the CEB will secure the necessary supplementary power required to maintain an uninterrupted 24-hour power supply. He addressed concerns about potential power cuts and urged citizens not to be misled by false information disseminated by certain political groups. Wijesekera mentioned that the Cabinet had approved the continuous provision of electricity to all areas of the country and endorsed utilising the maximum water capacity of the Samanalawewa Reservoir for electricity generation. He explained that the Electricity Board had already commenced releasing 3.5 million cubic metres of water from the reservoir’s maximum capacity since 3:00 a.m. on 8 August to generate electricity. He noted that between 11 – 15 August, the plans include releasing 2.5 million cubic metres of water to generate electricity. However, considering the existing water capacity, by 16 August, the electricity generation activities of the Samanalawewa reservoir will have to be temporarily suspended. The Cabinet has also granted approval to finalise the Polpitiya and Hambantota transmission line systems and procure electricity as needed. The Irrigation Department and the Water Management Committee hold the responsibility for releasing water required for power generation in other reservoirs. The Samanalawewa reservoir’s water capacity is efficiently managed for electricity generation under the CEB’s supervision. With adherence to the planned programme, the CEB aims to provide electricity without interruption until 15 September. Wijesekera acknowledged that due to the release of additional water from the Samanalawewa Reservoir, there’s a risk of power cuts in the Matara and Hambantota Districts of the Southern Province and partially in the Galle and Ratnapura Districts for a specified period. He emphasised on the essential purchase of electricity, given the insufficient water capacity in the Samanalawewa reservoir. To ensure continuous power supply, arrangements are being made to purchase electricity by 16 August. He stressed on the government’s proactive approach to address the immediate crisis and prevent further crises. Considering the available water capacity, all power plant systems are operational to supply electricity. Wijesekera clarified that the government has not taken any decision to implement power cuts and undue fear should not be generated among the public. Power cuts adversely impact tourism and industries. He highlighted that the plan for uninterrupted power supply was presented to the Cabinet after consultation with all parties. In addition to ensuring continuous electricity supply, the government has also resolved to allocate a specific amount of water for agricultural purposes. Recognising the ongoing drought situation and potential climate changes, Wijesekera expressed the government’s commitment to securing necessary electricity supply for the next two years and obtaining the required legal provisions. Wijesekera criticised factions with vested interests for attempting to politicise the matter during a drought crisis. He called for unity among all parties to collaborate with the government and officials in addressing the challenges faced by the people. Additionally, he informed that Unit 2 of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, generating 270 megawatts, suffered a breakdown due to a technical issue.

Speaking at a press conference, held at the President’s Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (8), Wijesekara stated that the CEB informed him that Rajapaksa hadn’t been issued a bill for those services. A report explaining the reasons behind the absence of an invoice for the past three years will be produced tomorrow (10). Wijesekara said, “It’s unlikely that anyone would pay for something without receiving a bill. The Minister has responded to the social media release by writing a letter on this matter. Subsequently, we’ve instructed the ministry and CEB to swiftly investigate why the bill wasn’t provided to the MP and ensure it reaches him. If any payments are due, the responsibility of delivering the bill lies with the CEB.” Former Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Provincial Council member Nalin Hewage last week revealed that he received a response from the CEB to his Right to Information (RTI) request. Accordingly, the CEB confirmed that an outstanding sum of Rs 2.6 million was due for the Weeraketiya residence, linked to security lights and generators, used during an event held between 12 and 15 September 2019. Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara shifted the blame to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) in regard of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Namal Rajapaksa’s alleged unpaid electricity bill for the services obtained for his wedding in 2019. Addressing the press conference held at the President’s Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (8), Wijesekara said that the CEB informed him that Rajapaksa hasn’t received a bill for those services and the report as to why he hasn’t received an invoice for the past three years will be submitted on 10 August. “I don’t think anyone would pay for something if they haven’t received a bill. Minister has written a letter in this regard responding to the release that was in social media. Following, we have instructed the ministry and CEB to make an immediate inquiry on why the invoice has not been given to the MP and make sure it has been given to him. If there’s any payments to be made the CEB should be responsible on handing over the bill to anyone,” he added. Former Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Provincial Council member Nalin Hewage claimed earlier today that the CEB responded to his RTI request, stating that Namal Rajapksa has yet to settle the electricity bill from his 2019 wedding. The RTI document reveals an outstanding amount of Rs. 26,82,246.57 for the Weeraketiya house, related to security lights and generators used during an event held between September 12, 2019, and September 15, 2019.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts.

Bail was set at two sureties of one million rupees each and the Magistrate also imposed a travel ban on the suspects. Although the Bambalapitiya Police requested that the suspects be remanded to a reserved prison, the Magistrate explained that since the Police did not provide enough evidence to the Court for remanding the Excise officers, they would be granted bail.

Tendulkar, with several young people, who are a part of the UNICEF-supported Children’s Club network of the Department of Probation and Child Care Services participated in a ‘close cricket match’  yesterday (8). Prior to the ‘match,’ Tendulkar emphasised that it is important for every child in every country to have the opportunity to grow up in a state of happiness and good health. He also encouraged children to engage in sports, noting its potential to enhance focus and determination. He stressed that many children suffer from stunting. During his visit, Tendulkar also made a stop at a pre-school that benefits from UNICEF’s mid-day school meal programme. Here, he actively participated by serving nutrient-rich meals to the children. He expressed his deep appreciation for the heartwarming practice observed at the school, where he witnessed students, as they enjoyed their mid-day meal, their teacher walking around with a plate. The children voluntarily set aside a portion of their meal on this plate. Curious about the purpose, Tendulkar inquired, and the teacher explained  that this is for all the  birds outside and they know it’s their food time too. He said he had also the opportunity to spend time with their families in the tea plantation and he understood their challenges. Tendulkar visited the Sabaragamuwa Province where he interacted with children from various schools, played cricket and interacted with Indian Origin Tamils. He advocated the local therapeutic food, which is similar in operation in India, which is a ready to eat package made out of food that is available in the area, having all the local ingredients, making it a nutritious meal, which he believed is practiced here in Sri Lanka as well. Tendulkar started his engagements with UNICEF in 2015. He lauded the efforts of all government and non-government organisations towards bringing a positive change despite challenging environments. Since August 2022, UNICEF’s midday meal programme has been providing nutritious meals to 50,000 preschool children in nearly 1,400 schools across the country. The meal programme has also helped boost pre-school attendance.  “Children require a nutrient-rich diet and quality education to reach their full potential. By investing in their education and nutrition, we are not only investing in their future but also every country’s future,” said Tendulkar. “The children I spoke with are showing great tenacity, and their hope for a better future remains strong. We need to continue supporting them so they keep achieving their goals,” added Tendulkar. Since Tendulkar was appointed as the first UNICEF  Ambassador for South Asia in 2013, he has been playing a pivotal role in improving the lives of children in South Asia. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The DGPR of the Presidential Secretariat promised to discuss with the President the possibilities of taking disciplinary action against Health Secretary, the Chairman of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), the Chairman of the State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC), the Additional Secretaries responsible for pharmaceutical importation and all hospital directors, who allegedly signed the relevant documents for the procurement of medicinal drugs. The DGPR for the Presidential Secretariat promised the trade unions that he would hold discussions with the President regarding the changing of positions of many of the Ministry’s senior officials, including that of the current Director General of Health Services (DGHS), Dr. Asela Gunawardena, who has allowed the health system to go astray without a road plan and is directly responsible for the collapse of the health system since the time of the Covid- 19. The Office of the DGPR said it would form an Operational Centre from within the health service.  He also invited the trade unions to prepare a National Health Policy which could make arrangements for any minister, who  takes over the ministry, to follow a transparent manner regarding human and infrastructural resources, medicinal drug supply network and procurement process. Joint Convener of the National Movement of Health Professionals (NMHP),  Ravi Kumudesh  alleged that citizens bore a heavy burden at present, owing to questionable allocations of money to select companies due to very obvious and questionable procurement practices which results in greater damage to the national wealth. Convener of Civil Organisations and the National Movement Against Bribery and Waste, Jamuni Kamanta Roshan, warned that his outfit would start hunger strikes and protests in front of the Ministry of Health after next week, if the President failed to provide a positive solution within a week after holding the lives of the people to ransom for the 134 votes he received in parliament.

Chanaka said yesterday (7). Earlier, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) refused to release water from the Samanalawewa to the paddy fields, warning that by releasing water the Southern Province would be deprived of 120 MW electricity generated from the Samanalawewa reservoir. That was despite the Satyagraha started by the farmers at Embilipitiya demanding water be released from the Samanalawewa to the Udawalawa Reservoir. Yesterday (7) marked the 15th day since the launching of Satyagraha. Chanaka told the media that the pertinent authorities have been duly informed to initiate the release of water specifically for agricultural purposes. This decision comes as a result of a meeting held yesterday (7), under the leadership of Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekara. The discussion revolved around the release of water necessary for agricultural tasks from the Samanalawewa Reservoir, as well as managing the consequences on power generation due to the prevailing unpredictable weather patterns. State Minister D.V. Chanaka, the Chairman and General Manager of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), officials from the CEB’s System Control Unit and representatives from the Irrigation Department participated in the meeting. Chanaka pointed out the hardships face by the people living in Hambantota and emphasised on the necessity of delivering the required water for cultivation purposes. Meanwhile, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara disclosed that a crucial meeting was held at the President’s office on Sunday (6). This meeting brought together officials from the CEB and the Irrigation Department to discuss strategies aimed at maintaining an uninterrupted power supply, free from scheduled power cuts. Additionally, the matter of allocating the maximum possible amount of water for agricultural use was presented to the Cabinet of Ministers yesterday (7). Wijesekara said, on X social media platform (previously twitter), the completion of the Polpitiya-Hambantota transmission line, a project funded by the Asian Development Bank has been halted due a dispute between a landowner and the CEB, revolving around the government’s valuation of a 650-metre stretch of land crucial to the transmission line. “The ministry has set 11 August as the date for a discussion under the auspices of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to resolve this matter. Upon resolution of the dispute, the project could be completed within just four days. Compensation based on government valuation has already been disbursed to 2,500 individuals along a 150 km stretch, where the project has been successfully executed,” Wijesekara said.

As the consequences of climate change continue to unfold, the region is being significantly impacted. UNICEF, the United Nations children’s agency, disclosed that approximately 460 million children in South Asia, equivalent to 76 per cent of children in the region, are confronted with extreme heat conditions. This stark figure stands in contrast to a third of children globally who face similar challenges due to rising temperatures. Sanjay Wijesekera, UNICEF’s Regional Director for South Asia, emphasised the severity of the situation, stating, “With the world at global boiling, the data clearly show that the lives and well-being of millions of children across South Asia are increasingly threatened by heat waves and high temperatures.” The report particularly underscores the vulnerability of children in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives and Pakistan, who are deemed to be at an “extremely high risk” due to the effects of climate change. The criterion for such risk is experiencing 83 or more days per year with temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). Children, due to their physiological development, struggle to swiftly adapt to temperature fluctuations and struggle to effectively dissipate excess heat from their bodies. Sanjay Wijesekera highlighted this vulnerability, stating, “Young children simply cannot handle the heat.” He emphasised that unless immediate action is taken, these children will continue to bear the brunt of more frequent and more severe heatwaves in the years to come. The impacts of global warming, largely driven by the burning of fossil fuels, have led to a 1.2-degree Celsius rise in global temperatures since the late 1800s. This increase has exacerbated heatwaves, making them longer, hotter, and more frequent, while also intensifying other weather extremes such as storms and floods. The gravity of the situation was underscored by the unprecedented heat experienced in July, which was recorded as the hottest month globally. This intense heat, magnified by global warming, affected tens of millions of individuals in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Scientists stress that the world must adapt to the existing heat and other repercussions caused by emissions. Urgent action is required to significantly reduce carbon pollution within this decade to avert even more dire consequences in the future."

Dr. Prasad has said that the DWC will perform a field visit with environmentalists and come to a decision. Meanwhile, the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) Senior Adviser Hemantha Withanage and CEJ Executive Director Dilena Pathragoda, on the same day sent a Letter of Demand (LOD) to the Minister of Wildlife and the Director General of DWC demanding to halt the translocation of the elephant.  “Translocation of ‘Chandi’, a majestic one-tusk elephant, who has resided in the Galgamuwa area for over 50 years, is deeply concerning. Chandi’s home range has always been in Ehetuwewa, Galgamuwa and his connection to the land and its ecosystem is deeply ingrained. He is not aggressive towards people but sometimes raids crops and causes a minor amount of property damage. However, unlike most other elephants, he tends to come into populated areas during daytime and we understand that the DWC officers are often called upon to chase him away,” the CEJ in the LOD said. Chandi was captured for the first time in 2009, tied up, taken by truck to Somawathiya National Park and released. As you are also aware a GPS collar was put on Chandi at capture. After release in Somawathiya, Chandi left the park, went west towards Kantale, then turned south and crossing the Dambulla Trincomalee road at Habarana, proceeded to Galewela. He went through Galewela town, causing disturbances and a number of incidents. Then he tumed west again and got back to Galgamuwa after walking 243 km in 28 days. After he was back in his home range, he lived there for a number of years with minor issues. Then around 2015, he was captured again and taken to the Elephant Holding ground in Horowpothana. He was not collared this time. After a few months, he escaped from the holding ground and returned to Galgamuwa. He again lived there for a number of years as usual.” The LOD further stated, “in 2019 he was captured for the third time and taken to Horowpathana Holding ground for the second time. This time again he was collared with a GPS collar. He escaped from the holding ground for the second time and again came back to Galgamuwa. On his way he was involved in a number of conflict incidents and was also involved in fights with other male elephants around Horowpathana. Since then, he has been living in Galgamuwa with minor issues as usual. “However, the situation has drastically changed since Chandi’s previous relocations. He has now lost his sight in both eyes and has grown old, making him more vulnerable than ever. Translocating a blind and ailing elephant would expose him to severe stress, potentially leading to a painful and untimely demise in an unfamiliar environment.” The CEJ pointed out that Chandi’s translocation is very likely to cause increase and wider spread human-elephant conflict and cannot be justified in terms of human-elephant conflict mitigation.

The incident took place within the Academy premises at 11.27a.m., shortly after the aircraft took off from China Bay airfield at around 11.25 a.m. Pilot, Wing Commander Tharindu Herath (fondly known as TK) and the Engineering officer, Flying Officer Peshan Warnasooriya, both hailing from Kurunegala, died in the crash. Following the incident, the Commander of the Air Force, Air Marshal Udeni Rajapaksa, appointed a board of investigation to conduct an immediate probe into the incident. He too visited the location to assess the situation. Wing Commander Tharindu Herath, an alumnus of Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala, joined the Sri Lanka Air Force on 12 January 2006 as an Officer Cadet in the General Duties Pilot Branch to the Intake 49.  In February 2012, Wing Commander Herath (who at the time was Flight Lieutenant) successfully executed a controlled ejection when the MIG 27 fighter Jet, belonging to the Sri Lanka Air Force No. 12 Jet Squadron he piloted, crashed in Dummalasooriya. That incident did not cause any damage to life. Flying Officer Peshan Warnasooriya, a past student of St. Anne’s College, Kurunegala, joined the Sri Lanka Air Force in 2017 as an Officer Cadet in the 35th Intake at Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), in the Aeronautical and General Engineering Branch."

Priyantha Fernando lodged a complaint with the Anuradhapura Police yesterday (7), alleging that an activist from the UNP Youth Organisation in Anuradhapura threatened him. Fernando alleges that an individual claimed that Nandika Viranjith Thambugala, who is also the Chairman of the Aura Lanka Group of Companies, is his uncle. The threat took place at the Anuradhapura weekly fair around 7:15 p.m. on the previous day (6). According to Fernando’s account, the interaction began with a casual conversation, where the person accused him of sabotaging a music festival organised by his uncle, Rajanganaya Yaya, at the 18th milepost. “He warned that they possessed the means to handle those who speak out against them, invoking the influence of the underworld. He said he knows that I was the one who opposed the music event and that they possess the tools to handle such big mouths,” Fernando alleged. Fernando said realising the potential danger, he chose to step back and distance himself from the situation, suspecting that the individual might be armed. Subsequently, “I discovered that the person who had threatened me hailed from the Ulukkulam area of Anuradhapura,” he said. Anuradhapura Police have initiated an investigation.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/08/08/mineral-deposits-in-sri-lanka-are-for-sale/,Mineral Deposits In Sri Lanka Are For Sale,Author not found,0,2023-08-07T20:31:00+00:00," Debt-ridden Sri Lanka still has no clear local plan to build the economy rather than implementing an IMF package. However, the forest and mining deregulation, which former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa initiated, seems to be continuing under President Wickremesinghe. The former President initiated releasing 500,000 Ha of other State Forest, which we were able to reverse through a legal process. In recent weeks Forest Department top officials have visited several districts to identify lands coming under the purview of the Forest Department to release them for human settlements and cultivation. This is the result of a Cabinet decision taken in January 2023. It was reported that 26,000 Ha in Mullaitivu and 10,000 Ha in Moneragala have been identified for release. It was learned that more than 100,000 Ha will be released. This subject is even on the agenda of the all-party conference. Meanwhile mineral resources in Sri Lanka are facing a major threat as the GSMB is drafting necessary policy and regulatory changes to sell the valuable deposit to foreign companies. In this direction, the International Mines and Mineral Forum (IMMF -2023) is scheduled to be held on 20 and 21 October 2023, in Sri Lanka. This event is based on the new regulation gazetted under number 2313/37 in January 2023 and under 9(e) the mineral rights of the Republic have been changed by giving priority to the landowner to explore minerals. It says “(e) Notwithstanding the issuance of a valid exploration license to an applicant by the bureau, if an owner of a private land situated within the area of the land in respect of which the license has been issued, may make an application to minimum grid unit amount, regardless of the fact that the same grid has been previously granted to a third party under an exploration licence.” As we know, mining is a skilled industry. It requires relevant expertise to mine, segregate and value add. The above regulation can easily lead to a scam process and could encourage corruption during  obtaining  exploration licenses. This may lead to many social and environmental impacts. It looks like the GSMB is planning to ‘Kill the goose that lays the golden egg’ by rapid mining, but without value added to the mineral resources. We think this sudden decision to promote extensive mining at once with foreign investment, may lead to unsustainable consequences. Minister Chamara Sampath is leading this sale. In fact, he is planning to sell the Eppawela phosphate deposit, too. As an initial step, three trade licenses have been issued to the colleagues of a former GSMB chairman, who was appointed to the position while holding the license for the largest mechanical sand mining project in the Mahaweli River. This week TV channels reported that the Minister received legal opinion from the Attorney General that the Eppawela deposit can be sold with no legal barrier. The battle to save Eppawela Phosphate deposit was initiated in the early ‘90s and in 1999 The Environmental Foundation filed a Court case on behalf of seven petitioners from the area, including Ven. Mahamankadawala Piyarathana Thera. This case led to one of the most powerful environmental judgments in Sri Lanka delivered by Justice R. Amarasinghe, Justice Wadugodapitiya, and Justice Gunasekara. A proposal was made in 1992 to sell the phosphate deposit to a US company called Freeport Mcmoran and Japanese counterpart IMC Agrico with only five per cent shares for Lanka Phosphate Limited. The judgment in the case, Bulankulama v. Min. of Industrial Development (Eppawala case), S.C. Application No. 884/99 (F/R) issued, was based on many considerations including local phosphate requirement and environmental grounds. The judgment referred to the involvement of the National Science Foundation and stated, “based on a statement by  Prof. V.K. Samaranayake On the 23 July, 1999 a committee of twelve scientists, of the National Science Foundation, submitted a report under the title “The optimal use of Eppawela rock phosphate in Sri Lankan agriculture.” Having observed that the proposal of the US Mining company, “in the view of many of the Professional Associations in the country, eg the Institution of Engineers, Institute of Chemistry, National Academy of Sciences and most individual scientists and engineers, said this deal is highly disadvantageous to the country and with highly adverse environmental impacts,’’ the committee examined various proposals made and suggested options which in its view are more advantageous to the country. Although Minister Chamara Sampath is confident that they can sell the Eppawala deposit, the judgment prevents the respondent from entering into ANY contract relating to the Eppawela phosphate deposit up to the time. “(1) a comprehensive exploration and study relating to the (a) locations, (b) quantity, moving inferred reserves into the proven category, and (c) quality of apatite and other phosphate minerals in Sri Lanka is made by the third respondent, The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences of Sri Lanka and the National Science Foundation and the results of such exploration and study are published: and (2) any project proponent, whomsoever obtains the approval of the Central Environmental Authority, according to law, including the decisions of the superior Courts of record of Sri Lanka.” There is a misconception that a recent report produced by the GSMB fulfills the order. Unfortunately, the report only covers the northern section of the deposit, but I was told the southern section was not properly studied in this uncompleted study. During the Eppawela struggle it was found the agreement covered a 56 square km block of the mine and the total area including the buffer zone was 800 sq km, which also has some phosphate and other mineral deposits. A proper report needs to make a comprehensive study on the full area and make it available for the public at large. It also needs to be done in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences of Sri Lanka and the National Science Foundation. Meanwhile the second order requires the production of a proper Environmental Impact assessment under the National Environmental, an Act considering many of the facts and points mentioned in the case order.  While we know the EIA process in Sri Lanka is highly corrupt, they still need to respect the case order, in which the public can refer back to the Supreme Court. In my opinion the Eppawela case was brought to protect the phosphate deposit for the local needs as it is not a regenerative resource and to protect people and environment in the area. Judgment was delivered based on the principle of the public trusteeship doctrine which agrees that Natural resources in the country are owned by the people and the government is only the trustee. Only a comprehensive study can give proper opinion on the size of the deposit and the environmental and social consequences. The Industries Minister’s urgency to sell this deposit during his tenure will not bring justice to the people or the country. We should sustainably manage our mineral resources and do value adding to make the best use of such natural resources.

The event was attended by several UNP working committee members, including the Organiser of UNP for Matale District, Priyani Wijeratne. MP Abeywardena acknowledged the previous pattern of political exploitation in the country, where both the rich and the educated faced challenges, leading to setbacks in the plantation economy. He stressed the need to break away from such practices and move forward together to build a future where the interests of both the poor and the rich are aligned. The UNP Chairman expressed unwavering confidence that President Wickremesinghe’s vision and leadership would propel Sri Lanka to become a powerful nation in Asia. He praised the ‘Aswesuma’ welfare programme and emphasised the necessity of creating an environment where the younger generation can thrive while upholding their dignity and reputation.

Dr. Senaratne, when contacted yesterday (7), noted that it would be illegal and unethical for any medical practitioner to practise when his licence has been suspended. Any medical practitioner practising without the licence – even temporarily would be a quack, he noted. The SLMC registration was important for all doctors to practise.  Fielding questions he noted that the Health Ministry was very wrong to have allowed a Judicial Medical Officer (JMO), even if suspended for eight months, to practise without his registration to practice. He noted that the Ministry should have taken immediate action – as soon as the SLMC informed it of its decision to move into action. The former Minister said that the attempts to get the Public Service Commission (PSC) involved in the matter, while attempting to shift the responsibility to the PSC and the Colombo JMO’s office, without having taken the proper timely measures, was highly unacceptable. Attempts to contact the Health Secretary, the Director General Health Services (DGHS) and the Acting Deputy Director General (Medical Services-II) failed. However, the Health Ministry is alleged to have launched a Ministerial –level probe into Dr.Haq continuing to practice despite the imposition of an eight-month suspension beginning 20 December 2022. The Health Ministry also noted that the PSC had been notified of the suspension while it was awaiting a response from it before taking further disciplinary action. Meanwhile Dr. Haq had continued practising sans his SLMC registration whilst conducting two important post-mortems, including that of the deceased three year-old who had been receiving treatment at Lady Ridgeway Hospital, following kidney surgery.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The decision was made with the well-being of students in mind, aiming to reduce the burden of heavy schoolbags on their physical health. As part of this initiative, the government will provide children with one textbook per school term. Minister Premajayantha emphasised that limiting the number of school term tests to one is a step towards achieving this goal. Instead of multiple term tests, assessments will be conducted at the end of each lesson or module. The marks obtained by students in these assessments will be computerised and added to the marks obtained at the year-end examination. Initially, 70 per cent of the total marks will be based on the final exam, while the remaining 30 per cent will be derived from the module assessments. Gradually, this percentage will be increased to a range of 50 per cent, allowing a more balanced evaluation of the students’ performance, the minister pointed out. In addition, the minister highlighted that once this system is in place, regular attendance in classes and completion of daily tasks will be mandatory for students. The aim is to reduce the need for students to attend external tuition classes, enabling them to focus on their studies within the school environment. Furthermore, Premajayantha said that parents will no longer feel compelled to spend money on unnecessary tuition classes due to the streamlined evaluation system. Instead, they can use these resources to meet the nutritional needs of their children. The minister emphasised that such reforms are essential for the successful implementation of free education, which remains the primary objective of the government."

The Pier was destroyed and had been abandoned during the conflict in the North. Accordingly, on the instructions of Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has been tasked with the re-construction of the pier. The estimated cost of reconstruction is Rs 1.8 billion. Parallel to the re-construction of the pier, about 10 acres of State-owned land, bordering the port, will be acquired for port infrastructure development. Under these new developments, a modern passenger terminal and warehouse facilities will be constructed. It has also been decided to call for RFPs for these investments to be made under PPP. In the past, a passenger ferry service existed between Talaimannar and Danushukodi. However, the Dhanuskodi port was completely destroyed by cyclones. Currently, India has completed the development of the Rameswaram Port and the Indian Government has given the clearance to commence a passenger ferry service between Mannar and Rameswaram. To make the initial plans for the project and to carry out the necessary inspections, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva made a special visit to the port on 4 August. After the inspection, the Minister also attended a special discussion to discuss and resolve issues pertaining to the project. Speaking at the event, the Minister said that the reconstructions will re-awaken the strong correlation between the two neighbouring nations. The Minister emphasised that the commencement of the ferry service between Talaimannar and Rameswaram will also facilitate Sri Lankan pilgrims to India by providing low-cost travel facilities. He also said that these measures will facilitate the exchange of goods between the two countries and will be a commendable opportunity to popularise the products of the people of northern Sri Lanka in India.

During an event in Bomiriya, Kaduwela, the Minister highlighted the importance of a structured system for three and four-year-old children’s education. He stated that without a proper foundation at the pre-school level, school education will not be able to effectively shape their minds. As a result, the ministry cannot allow the establishment of pre-schools without the necessary training and qualifications. Premajayantha further emphasised the significance of early education, stating that education should begin at the pre-school level and not in the middle stages of schooling.Currently, there are approximately 40,000 pre-school teachers and about 19,000 pre-schools, he said. “As all pre-school students eventually enter Grade One classes in schools, the ministry will provide training to pre-school teachers to follow a curriculum based on activity-based learning. Upon completion of specific training hours, these teachers will receive a certificate. For those pre-school teachers willing to continue their profession, a diploma certificate will be awarded upon further training.” In light of these initiatives, it has been decided that pre-schools must possess the required pre-school training certificate or diploma before they can commence operations, the minister pointed out."

Ganesan recently said, they will support the government that backs their policies despite showing allegiance to Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). Addressing the press at the Jaffna Press Club on 2 August, he stated that they observed the SLPP gradually resurfacing after a period of seclusion last year during the peak of protests, and they were unable to engage with their constituents openly. “It seems they are now making public appearances and holding meetings, although some of these gatherings may not be entirely voluntary, but rather orchestrated. This might be causing annoyance among certain sections of the public. We are aware of the President’s track record in creating divisions among people, evident from his past actions. It appears he is employing the same strategy with the SLPP,” the MP said. He also said, there is an attempt to get the SJB to join the UNP, but all internal matters cannot be exposed to the public. Within the SLPP, there appears to be a faction aligning with President Wickremesinghe’s policies, he pointed out. Some young politicians from the SLPP are siding with the President. MPs like Namal Rajapaksa, who are known for promoting nationalism, had their members in national costumes in the Parliamentary Complex, but MP Ganesan pointed out that these politicians have undergone external transformations, such as adopting Western-style suits, possibly indicating their allegiance to the President’s ideology. He continued, “This regime, loyal to Ranil Wickremesinghe, is taking shape within the SLPP, with even Cabinet ministers like Susil Premajayantha and Prasanna Ranatunga along with several others now among the government’s advisers. The President seems to be diligently working towards his goals, and we must remain patient as many new events are likely to unfold in the coming months.” Regarding the 13th Amendment (13A), Ganesan commented on India’s stance, saying, “India has consistently reiterated the call for full implementation of the 13A and holding elections. There is no change in India’s position on this matter.” BY Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Dela Bandara lamented.   He said yesterday (3) that this amounted roughly to the size of a credit card. “If we consume micro plastics which amounts to the size of a credit card on a weekly basis then the monthly consumption would amount to 20g, the Nutritionist observed. Annually that would amount to 250g of plastic, Bandara said. “Although we have been only talking about micro plastic in relation to environment pollution research has shown that micro plastics have entered the food we consume, the water we drink and even the air that we breathe, Dela Bandara said. He noted that there was nothing extraordinary about this fact as from the cutting board used in the kitchen, to the lunch sheet used when wrapping food to the shopping bags which some people use to carry tea contains micro plastics.  Secretary, Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) Dr. Sajith Edirisinghe, elaborated that studies had shown that main cause of getting micro plastic into our bodies was from nylon cloth and nylon fishing nets. “Most of the micro plastic enters our system through the air that we breathe. Our tissue is exposed to all the toxins and heavy metals that are absorbed by these micro plastics as a result. This causes genetic mutations which could lead to cancers and non-cancerous diseases.    Dr. Edirisinghe urged people not dispose plastic by roadside, do not burn it in the back yard, but hand them over to centres where they can be recycled.  He urged people also to refrain from burning plastic items, as it emits a number of poisonous chemicals and gases which are very harmful to the body. Young children whose lungs are not fully formed would fall ill regularly if exposed to such gasses and chemicals, he warned.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Dr. Y. B. L. D. Basnayake, the MOH of Bogawantalawa, has written a letter to the Secretary of the Divisional Secretariat, Norwood and the National Gem and Jewellery Authority, urging them to take immediate steps to close these hazardous pits. In his letter to the National Gem and Jewellery Authority, Dr. Basnayake highlighted that in 2015, the authority granted permission for gem mining in the Chapelton Part of Kotiyagala Estate, under its jurisdiction, for a one-year period. However, despite the end of the gem mining activity, the large pits that were mined have not been properly closed. As a result, the local community’s health is now at risk due to these open pits. The situation is particularly concerning as the Castlereigh Reservoir predominantly flows into Keselgamu Oya and Bogawantalawa Theresia Estate, where the unsealed gem pits are located dangerously close to the school and Estate houses. Despite having issued written notices to the Plantation Management Authority and the National Gem and Jewellery Authority, for several years, no action has been taken to address the issue, as stated in the letter by Dr. Basnayake. Meanwhile, a plantation worker lost his life after falling into one of these large ditches filled with water, while cutting grass in the plantation recently. The proximity of these pits to the route used by residents to access Bogawantalawa town through Keselgamu Oya adds to the urgency of the situation. The plantation workers of Bogawanthalawa Theresia Estate are also urging the immediate closure of these hazardous pits to prevent further accidents and protect the well-being of the community.

This discussion was held on 31 July in Parliament. Although the Government has given a target to open new tax files, the issues that have arisen in implementing this were discussed at length. Pointing out that there is a huge delay in the initiation of new tax files using the RAMIS system currently in use by the Inland Revenue Department, union representatives pointed out that urgent action is needed to streamline this. The Committee said, in order to reap the full benefit of the RAMIS system, IRD should take responsibility for its implementation and a public-private partnership should be created to run it. It was also pointed out that the department has been instructed to join the integrated information system that will be created by merging 13 State Institutions. Tax files are to be opened for people above the age of 18 in connection with the census to be conducted by the Department of Population and Statistics and collect information using a mobile application and take steps to set up a proper data system."

He stressed that due to a shortage of lecturers at these Universities, educational activities in faculties such as medicine, engineering, agriculture and social sciences could come to a halt sooner than later. Prof. Jayawardana said that during a six-month period from January to June this year, some 250 University lecturers had left the service to opt for other vocations or had left for overseas seeking greener pastures. He said among the reasons contributing to this crisis situation had been inadequate salaries paid to university lecturers, exorbitant taxes being imposed and the uncertainty surrounding the country’s immediate future. He explained that though 11,900 lecturers have to be in service in Universities, presently only 6,000 were on duty. He charged that instead of taking prompt measures to address the situation, the Ministers including the subject Minister are continuing to belittle the services rendered by lecturers. Prof. Jayawardana added that university lecturers put in at least a 20-hour service per week and he condemned the recent remarks made by Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who had alleged that both University lecturers and school teachers render a similar service.

Pathirana stated that an income of USD 1,600 million is expected from exports of rubber and coconut in 2023. During a press conference at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), Dr. Pathirana said they expect USD 900 million from rubber and USD 700 million from coconut.  “The second Coconut Triangle would be launched in the Northern Province this year consisting of the areas of Jaffna, Mannar and Mullaitivu Districts in conjunction with World Coconut Day on 2 September. In the last two years, it was possible to get an income of Rs 1 billion from the export of rubber products. Due to the ability to purchase rubber for the manufacture of gloves during the last corona pandemic, it was possible to generate a sizable export income. But the demand for rubber goods is presently declining as a result of the global economic crisis. Therefore, it has been estimated that this year’s rubber-related export revenue will be around USD 900 million,” he added. He said the coconut export revenue has significantly increased in recent years. “The range of goods that can be found in our coconuts has led to an increase in demand. This year, it is anticipated that exports of coconut-related goods will bring in USD 700 million. It is anticipated that exports of goods related to coconuts would generate USD 2 billion in revenue during the next ten years. Thus, it is envisioned that Sri Lanka will develop a second coconut triangle. Local consumption accounts for two thirds of coconut production. One third is used for export. To increase export potential, this situation needs to be altered,’ he added. Pathirana said Jaffna, Mannar, and Mullaitivu Districts will be included in this second coconut triangle.

The procedure was settled in a favourable manner for those who submitted one of the highest bids during the tender procedure. They urged the CIABOC and the IGP to initiate an investigation regarding the questionable procurement process and put a stop to it. Dr. Sanjeeva noted that the procurement process for lenses should be recommenced with transparency. Lodging the complaint, Dr. Sanjeeva called for the removal of the Health Secretary from his post, while initiating corruption charges against him. He accused him of making footnotes in favour of the pharmaceutical company which quoted a high price for the importation of lenses. “It is a shame that when we pointed out that a loss ofRs 500 million was incurred due to the purchase of questionable antibiotics, the Health Minister himself admitted that his Ministry had paid over Rs 1 million to buy the drugs. It is a clear fact that such frauds are committed by officials because they know very well that the law will not be enforced,” he said.

As the production of liquid milk in the country is at a high level, the authorities of these companies requested the minister to stop the import of milk powder. However, the Minister instructed the officials of the Livestock Division of the Ministry of Agriculture to prepare a report for him as soon as possible regarding the increase in liquid milk production in the country. The Minister said the report will be submitted to Cabinet and further decisions will be taken regarding the import of milk powder.

She was talking about the quality of accommodation provided to tourists, such as Airbnb and homestays, during a media briefing at the President’s Media Centre (PMC)on Tuesday (1). “To revitalise the tourism industry, implementing a night economy was crucial. Tourists look for destinations that offer them and the freedom to enjoy life to the fullest. Closing tourist spots early, like at 10.00 p.m., would discourage tourists from visiting the country. To attract more tourists, it is essential to create vibrant and lively environment, rather than having ‘dull cities’ with limited nightlife experiences. To achieve this, it is necessary to extend the operating hours of tourist destinations, allowing visitors to have a more enjoyable experience. This might involve keeping certain places open late into the night, offering various entertainment options, and facilitating activities that appeal to tourists,” she pointed out. The Government has also taken steps to implement a system that assesses the quality of accommodation provided to tourists, such as Airbnb and homestays. Maintaining high-quality facilities and services can help Sri Lanka attract more tourists and enhance the overall tourism experience, she added. “With the implementation of these promotional programmes and initiatives, the State Ministry aims to strengthen Sri Lanka’s economy through a thriving and vibrant tourism industry. Emphasising a night economy, extending beach stays, and improving transportation connections will undoubtedly make Sri Lanka a more attractive and appealing destination for tourists from around the world. A thriving tourism sector can bring in substantial revenue, create job opportunities, and contribute significantly to the nation’s economic growth,” Gamage said. Gamage addressed the importance of direct flights with international airlines, particularly Chinese and Italian airlines, to enhance accessibility and convenience for tourists. Such partnerships can help attract more visitors and further contribute to the growth of Sri Lanka’s tourism sector. Further, she said a significant milestone is set to take place at the end of this year, as Sri Lanka plans to host the final competition of the World Travel Awards (WTA) in December. This event is expected to see the participation of 117 countries, further elevating Sri Lanka’s status as a global tourism destination. The President has been apprised of these developments, showing the Government’s commitment to showcasing Sri Lanka’s potential to the world, the State Minister said. BY Nabiya Vaffoor"

The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The officials of the Excise Department highlighted various factors, including the increase in taxes in the last budget, that have contributed to the decrease in excise income. Moreover, the committee emphasised the importance of conducting appropriate surveys and providing clear instructions to the Ministry of Finance when proposing tax adjustments on alcohol. In addition, the committee urged the department to take immediate action in developing a new application to identify liquor bottles with counterfeit foolproof stickers. Although these stickers were introduced to prevent the circulation of fake products, it has been brought to light that counterfeit stickers are still prevalent in the market. It was revealed that the Excise Department currently lacks the necessary mechanisms to recognise such counterfeit stickers. (MD)"

This time around the programme focused on the literary achievements of Dr. Leel Gunasekara, a renowned senior administrative officer. The book titled ‘The Petition’, an English translation of  ‘Pethsama’ written in Sinhala authored by Dr.  Gunasekara was launched on this occasion. At the launch, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said; “Dr. Leel  Gunasekara   enriches  the never- ending river of Sri Lankan literature. Literature keeps a nation alive and  allows a nation to think anew.  I see it as a blessing that you have been gifted and able to accomplish these objectives over a long time”, the Premier said. “Pethsama is a work of art which consists of characters living in real society through the generation of time. The simplicity of genuine Sri Lankans can be understood in this book. It manifests the language of our country, lifestyle and how we have stood up bravely as a nation”, he further said.  Leel  Gunasekara is  a pioneer in the public service and education service as well. Once, Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike appointed him as the Inspector General of Police while he served as a Government Agent(GA). How ironical it is that Leel  Gunasekara who was a GA at that time  while appreciating the rustic nature of the village was also appointed as Inspector General of Police which has  a great responsibility. You would have been appointed to such a position because of your approach to the literary service as well as to the public service. Nowadays, the IGP is heavily criticised. Such criticisms were there even before and even after your appointment.  Under those circumstances you were steadfast in your love for literature and ensured that humanity rose above everything else. “When I was Foreign Minister, I heard about a report you prepared on the methods to be followed by low income earners of this country. It was stated in one chapter that strengthening the rural child with technical knowledge would help them when they left school. Even at this point of time imparting technical knowledge to children who drop out of school is not done in a proper manner in our country”, he said. Literary scholar Sunil Sarath Perera said, “Dr. Leel Gunasekara’s passion for History and his practical consciousness was extremely significant. I believe society itself gave him the opportunity to work as a writer for a long time. His experiences as a GA contributed greatly to the creation of these literary works. He enlivened the grievances of rustic life through his book ‘The Petition’. He displayed the authentic life of villagers who live in the rural areas of Nuwara  Kalaviya and Hathara Korale through his work of art.” The author said, “Today I am very happy to write an English novel for the first time and publish it under the patronage of the Prime Minister. I received the State Honorary Award in 1962 for ‘Pethsama’. Dr Gunapala Malalasekara, who watched Ediriweera Sarachchandra’s stage play ‘Maname’ said that Sarath’s work was excellent. It was at this point of time that I made up my mind that I too would produce a piece of work that would turn out to be excellent.  This book is a combination of ancient and modern literature that has inspired me.” Ven .Gatahaththe Sobitha Thera, Kirama Wimalajyothi Thera, MP Yadamini Gunawardena, Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka, Kumar Nadesan, retired senior civil officer Jolly Somasundaram, Head of Sarasavi publishers H.

Withanage expressed his concern about Sri Lanka’s current position at the 99th place in the business facilities improvement index, which is considered a significant global indicator. He pointed out that specific recommendations, issues arising from the relationship between the public and private sectors and outdated legal regulations are contributing factors to this situation. Acknowledging the support of President Wickremesinghe, Withanage stated that they have been granted full freedom to address these challenges and provide necessary solutions.

He pointed out that the use of illegal fishing techniques has become a common problem in both the Eastern and Northern provinces in recent times.

Meanwhile, Thondaman requested Devananda to promote aquaculture in the lagoons and water bodies coming under the Department of Forest and Wildlife Conservation. Despite efforts to release these areas red tape has prevented it, he said.

A spokesperson for the Government Medical Officers’ Forum (GMOF) yesterday (31 July) accused parties with vested interests of having usurped a Director General of Dr. Anil Jasinghe’s calibre and overlooked even the Deputy Directors General who were more suitable both professionally and academically to uphold the position.  He lamented that the DGHS post was being prostituted with persons who had no idea of what managing a health system was. The spokesperson noted that the deaths related to medicinal drugs, shortage of essential drugs, and the cost of pharmaceuticals in private sector pharmacies were not only due to corruption. What is not seen or discussed is the general inefficiency in administration and management of services in the government health service. Recent incident of a death following an assault on a patient due to his alleged behaviour only reflects the mentality of the health assistants at the National Institute of Mental Health of having become complacent to the extent that they physically assaulted a man who was mentally ill. The spokesperson observed that six months ago the Deputy Director of the National Hospital, Colombo had almost been manhandled for having accused health assistants for using and selling harmful substances. But till date the Health Department has failed to initiate proper disciplinary action against perpetrators.He accused the Deputy Director General of Lady Ridgeway Hospital of coming on national television to give explanation regarding to the controversial issue related to a kidney patient when a scan would have revealed that the two kidneys were joined without him explaining it. A patient lost her life after taking injections for indigestion.  The GMOF Spokesperson noted that the incumbent DGHS could not even appoint permanent medical administrators to fill the 60 positions that were vacant. They include some important posts in the Colombo District. He lamented that all these issues were a result of maladministration due to the general inefficiency that is affecting the entire State health sector. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The process of purchasing necessary medicines and equipment through tenders is estimated to take at least nine months.

She also called on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to speed up relief measures for countries facing debt vulnerabilities. Terming multilateral development banks’ (MDBs) reforms and debt-relief measures for many stressed economies as the top two finance track priorities for India during its G20 Presidency, Sitharaman said a comprehensive, better and quicker approach is required to address the problem within the common framework of the IMF and World Bank, as well as “outside” it. “I quote the ‘outside of it’ equally as much as within the framework, as we have the example of Sri Lanka, a middle-income country which got into distress because its earnings were limited to tourism and some other areas like export of tea… Sri Lanka required a quick redressal, although outside of the framework because they are a middle-income country,” she noted in a discussion at the India Japan Forum. In Sri Lanka’s case, Japan, which holds the G7 Presidency currently, quickly took the lead to address the distress, she pointed out. “Japan came up, along with France and India, with a quick committee of creditors group, which started addressing the issue. And of course, it was an open forum, it wasn’t limited to just the three countries, China is welcome to participate as one of the big creditors,” Sitharaman said. Japan’s leadership in such cases with “a constructive approach to address debt distress” has been well-received, the Minister said, adding that this is an indicator that the G7 and G20 together would come up with solutions to the problem. While the MDBs are acting to alleviate debt distress, they need to be “more nimble”, the Minister said, noting that “we are looking at situations where countries are waiting for more than three or four years after the application seeking some redressal, to get the actual resolution of the issues”.

This revelation came to light during a discussion, held at the Ministry of Agriculture, which was chaired by the Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera. The discussion was initiated in response to protests by farmers, in recent days, demanding a sufficient water supply for their cultivation needs. During the meeting, officials from the Ministries of Agriculture, Mahaweli Development, Irrigation, and Power explored the possibility of obtaining water from the Samanala Wewa to replenish the Udawalawa Reservoir for a duration of 10 days. The CEB officials warned that such an action would result in a further decrease in water levels, leading to power cuts lasting one to three hours in the Southern Province. As per estimates, the existing water crisis could cause a loss of Rs 16.81 billion in paddy cultivation and an additional Rs 1.6 billion loss due to the disruption of power generation in the coming week. The Agriculture Minister highlighted that this situation could result in a total loss of approximately Rs 30 billion and severely impact rice production this year, too."

Informed sources yesterday (27) said the 48-year-old patient from Watareka, who was allegedly suffering from bipolar disorder, had been admitted to Ward 08 of the NIMH on 20 July, under the BHT 3245/2023. However, earlier this week he had allegedly succumbed to injuries sustained following an assault by a certain staff category of ward. They were allegedly attempting to restrain the patient. Ceylon Today learns the post-mortem, which had been performed subsequently, had revealed the deceased had suffered extensive multiple contusions due to the assault which resulted in an internal bleeding. Also, it was reported that when the alleged incident happened four nurses and four supportive staff were on duty. When queried, the Administration of the Hospital refused to comment saying that the Circular issued by the Health Ministry Secretary prevented them from issuing any comment to the media.  Meanwhile, the family of the deceased has lodged a complaint with the Mulleriyawa Police. The family accused the hospital of allegedly attempting to cover up the patient’s death. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Verité Research has been tracking the progress of budget promises since 2017, and Interim Budget 2022 has the largest proportion of proposals for which information was not provided. On average, information was not disclosed to assess progress of 38 per cent of the expenditure proposals between 2017-2021. For most of the Interim Budget 2022 proposals, no information was provided by the government agencies, even for requests made under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.  This has been a continuing trend since 2017. The Interim Budget 2022 assessment tracked 24 expenditure proposals made in the budget speech, with a total allocation of LKR 50.5 billion. Information received was sufficient to assess the progress of seven proposals, and the assessment revealed that only one proposal had been fulfilled as of 31 December 2022. The findings are published on the ‘Budget Promises’ dashboard housed under the publicfinance.lk platform of Verité Research. The assessments over the years reveal that a key factor that contributes to poor disclosure of progress is the confusion over who is responsible for implementation of the proposals. The National Budget Department (NBD) of the Ministry of Finance is responsible for budget implementation but is not fully aware of the agencies responsible for the implementation of proposals. For example, the agencies identified by the NBD as being responsible for implementation claimed they are not responsible for the implementation of 17 out of the 24 proposals tracked. This indicates one of two possibilities, the Verité Research said. “One is that the NBD, which is responsible for the estimation and appropriation of public finance resources, is unaware who the implementing agencies are. The other possibility is that the agencies are not aware that they are responsible for the implementation of these proposals. Both possibilities raise serious concerns about the accountability of the government in delivering promises made by the Minister of Finance in his budget speech in Parliament.”  The Interim Budget 2022 was presented at a crucial juncture in Sri Lanka’s history, where the country was mired in an economic crisis unlike any it has faced since independence. The budget strived to provide hope by promising to lay the foundation to change the economic trajectory of the country. These findings raise doubts as to whether Sri Lanka can genuinely expect a sustainable change in its economic trajectory without addressing the core problem that led to the crisis; lack of transparency and accountability in how the government manages the public funds, Verité Research alleged."

The width of the ship is 18.80 metres and its length is 100 metres. Colombo Dockyard added that this is the second ship built for Cable Laying and Repair work, and 255 ships have been built and delivered to European and Asian countries on various requests. Accordingly, Dockyard emphasised that European and Asian ship owners have gained confidence in ‘Colombo Dockyard’ and have chosen ‘Colombo Dockyard’ as the most suitable company for ship-building according to their needs in the future. The Minister said, “it is highly appreciated that Colombo Dockyard Company is engaged in a joint venture with the Sri Lanka Port Authority, as a company that manufactures the most modern cruise ships for Europe and the Asian region. Based on that situation, Sri Lanka will be appointed as a hub of ship-building in Asia by expanding the ship-building industry and through this, the young community of Sri Lanka will be able to become professionals rich in industrial knowledge and be directed to many sectors of the ship-building industry.” Chairman of ‘Colombo Dockyard’ company, Hideki Tanaka and Managing Director Thimira S. Godakumbura also participated."

In the first stage of the external track of the programme, which is being implemented under the Ministry’s Professional Accreditation Programme, five professions plumber, electrician, refrigeration/air conditioning technician, automobile mechanic, and automobile electrician were chosen for skill testing. The programme has been introduced by the Ministry in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India. In an effort to best regulate its labour market, it implemented SVP in July 2021. The first phase of the SVP intends to validate workers’ skills in five specialisations out of the 23 selected by the Ministry, with the goal of increasing the quality of professional workforce in the Saudi labour market and raising the level of professionalism. The goal is also to boost productivity and stop the influx of unskilled professional labour into the Kingdom’s labour market. Through two tracks—internal and international—the SVP seeks to confirm that employees in the targeted professions possess the essential skills. The international track works with a number of recognised international examination centres to examine professional labour before their arrival. By Khalidh Rizwan"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/07/28/plan-to-restrict-school-uniforms-to-aswesuma-beneficiaries/,Plan to restrict school uniforms to ‘Aswesuma’ beneficiaries,Author not found,0,2023-07-27T20:31:00+00:00," The Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) accused the Government of attempting to restrict the provision of school uniforms to the ‘Aswesuma’ beneficiaries. CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin said there is a plan to launch this programme by crediting money to the uniform account instead of providing uniform material. The purpose of this is to reduce the number of uniforms that have been provided free of charge to 430,000 schoolchildren so far. He emphasised that free uniforms and textbooks are the main reasons why children come to school. He also pointed out that a significant number of schoolchildren have stopped attending school due to the suspension of the lunch programme. Stalin queried whether the Government is attempting to limit education to a privileged few through such relief reductions, especially considering the increasing number of parents living in poor conditions. He further said, “Rulers always say that the best things are for the children. Yet, what we are presently receiving is also going to be cut. The number of underprivileged parents has increased, which in turn has led to an increase in child malnutrition. The main reason children come to school is the provision of free uniforms and textbooks. In the past, free shoes were given to selected schools. How can we expect children to come to school when all these benefits are systematically reduced? Is education only for a certain class?” Stalin also highlighted that the recent parliamentary committee report on the education system shows there are disparities in resource allocation. “There are over 3,000 schools with less than 100 students, and these poor children are the hardest hit. Sending a child to school costs at least Rs 300 a day, which is a great expense for parents. According to the Department of Census and Statistics, the cost of education often competes with the cost of food for parents. Thus, providing uniforms is a source of strength for parents,” he added. Stalin stressed that child malnutrition will likely lead to a decrease in intellectuals in the future. He highlighted that education is an investment for the country and the same holds true for free textbooks and uniforms. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

COPF chaired by Dr. Harsha de Silva expressed strong dissatisfaction over the absence of summoned officials responsible for coming before the committee. The committee stressed that when discussing matters related to a particular Ministry, Heads of the Ministry who are accountable to Parliament should be present at the proceedings. This concern arose during the committee meeting held on Tuesday (25) in Parliament, where the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report 2023, issued under Section 10 of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003 was under consideration. The report, presented by the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization, and National Policies, highlighted that the budget’s primary balance had a surplus of 0.1%. Revenue collection witnessed a significant YoY increase of 41.9% to Rs 1,317 billion, primarily due to a substantial rise in VAT on goods and services. However, the expenditure for the first half of the year amounted to Rs 2,560 billion, representing a YoY increase of 40.5%. Notably, domestic interest expense experienced the most substantial increase, rising by 51.6% toRs 1,273 billion in the first half of the year. During the meeting, Committee members raised several questions concerning the fiscal position, economic performance, expenditure, and the performance of State-Owned Enterprises based on the presented statistics by the officials in attendance. Key concerns were expressed by the Committee about the 11.5 per cent contraction in the first quarter of 2023. The Committee inquired about the root causes of this contraction and the specific measures taken to address these issues to prevent further economic downturns. Additionally, the Committee questioned the Ministry’s sustainable plan to achieve growth in line with the President’s vision for 2048. However, it was disclosed that there was no coherent strategy in place. The Committee was dissatisfied with the officials’ responses to queries, finding them ineffective and lacking clarity. They also discussed the increase in taxes, differentiating between those driven by inflation and policy changes in taxes. The Committee emphasised the importance of presenting adequate data and statistics when appearing before them. They urged officials from the Ministry of Finance to be more responsible, have a proper vision, and establish a focused team to achieve the goal of a sustainable economy."

Drafted at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, and adopted by the General Assembly on 10 September 1996, the CTBT has been open for signature since 24 September 1996 at the United Nations, New York. Sri Lanka was among the first signatories of the CTBT in October 1996, just days after the Treaty opened for signature. Sri Lanka later entered into a Facility Agreement with the CTBTO in June 2000 which led to the establishment of an auxiliary seismological station in Pallekale, Kandy, as part of the International Monitoring System (IMS) to verify compliance with the CTBT.

Secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Dr. Haritha Aluthge said according to data collected by the GMOA more than a thousand doctors have left the system since 2022 to date.  It has become a tough challenge to maintain patient care services in the peripheral hospital system. “If this trend continues, the day will not be far when services of not only the peripheral hospitals but the entire health service of the island will collapse,” he warned. It is no secret that the country’s medical specialists and senior doctors were leaving the country in the face of the current economic crisis, rising cost of living and socio-political instability. Dr. Aluthge said his union had continued to emphasise that a series of government policies should be implemented to encourage doctors to stay in the country – which, he observed “would be far better than illegal threats and the imposition of misplaced rules and regulations.”   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

However, the Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) did not participate in the APC. After meeting Tamil political parties recently, the President invited all the parties for an APC.

Ceylon Today learns that the parties could not reach a consensus with regard to enacting the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. It is reliably learnt that both Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and Freedom People’s Congress leader MP Dullas Alahapperuma had requested to hold the long-delayed Provincial Council Elections before enacting the 13th Amendment. Meanwhile, the PMD said, the President pointed out the need for inclusive discussions on the 13th Constitutional Amendment during the All-Party Conference and emphasised that this matter affects the entire country and should be addressed with the participation of all political parties, and not limited to just Tamil MPs. The President also highlighted that seven out of the nine Provincial Councils are situated in regions where a majority of Sinhalese people reside and emphasised the need to address the existing shortcomings if the Provincial Council system is to be sustained in the future."

They demanded that the remaining stalls be given to those already doing business in the vicinity of the Manning Market and to those who have applied and live in and around Colombo. According to the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), which called for inquiries from the UDA to determine who should be given the vacant stalls recently, they recommended wholesale vendors near and far. Based on these recommendations, the UDA selected around 200 applicants to be offered the remaining stalls for rent as far as Dambulla, Nittambuwa, Meerigoda etc. However, the protesters argued that many vendors who were already on the old list submitted to the UDA were being ignored. They claimed that the newly allocated stalls were given to outsiders, and there were still many old vendors deserving of stalls. UDA officials, speaking to Ceylon Today, stated that all the old Manning Market vendors from Pettah have been given stalls, and there are over 200 stalls remaining to be allocated to other vendors. The protesters believed that political affiliations were behind the decision. Further, the UDA revealed that some of the new Manning Market vendors have allegedly rented their stalls to third parties, effectively controlling the market. During the protests, the vendors claimed that the UDA was being selective in giving stalls to outsiders and that they would not allow such practices, as they identified many old vendors who did not get stalls for themselves. Earlier, Minister of Urban Development and Housing Prasanna Ranatunga revealed that he has been informed about the Manning Trade Complex, Peliyagoda being misused by external parties for various unlawful activities. In response to this, he has advised the police to take strict measures to enforce the law against those involved in such misconduct. Amidst the commotion, police were deployed, resulting in the arrest of around six protesters on the same day (26). By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Later that particular supplier and another were intentionally excluded when calling for tenders. He explained that such tactics were followed mostly as a result of the Health Ministry’s delay in meeting its bills. A large amount of The Health Ministry’s arrears possibly running into millions for previous purchases would pile up while those suppliers would be kept waiting. “The pharmaceutical suppliers were also running a business venture. Therefore, the Health Ministry while delaying payments to those suppliers would import the medicinal drug from an unregistered supplier leaving doubts as to the quality of the drug”, he lamented.   BY Dilanthi Jayamanne"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/07/27/canada-govt-redefining-reconciliation-in-sri-lanka-for-cheap-toronto-political-drama/,Canada Govt redefining ‘Reconciliation’ in Sri Lanka for cheap Toronto political drama,Author not found,0,2023-07-26T20:32:00+00:00," In spite of the reconciliation mumbo-jumbo, what is being promoted is retributive justice for a National Army and restorative justice for an internationally banned terrorist movement. When foreign governments slap sanctions on those who ended decades of terror and envoys visit terrorist linked individuals, what is the message being conveyed? It therefore comes as no surprise when successive Canadian envoys are happy to be chit chatting with those linked to either terrorism or separatism and now cultural genocide with the vandalism taking place targeting Buddhist archaeological sites. Of course, cultural genocide is a topic close at heart to Canada, having been declared guilty of mass murders of Canadian indigenous natives in residential schools run by the Church. The truth and reconciliation promoted is to forgive Canada and the Church and for the indigenous folk to forget, while the indigenous natives continue to suffer discrimination and inequalities. Obviously the same remedy is being peddled in Sri Lanka. On 17 January 2005, Paul Martin the Prime Minister of Canada met the TNA and TRO at the Colombo Hilton. TNA requested the Canadian PM to channel funds through NGOs instead of through the GoSL.  Incidentally, the TRO was banned by US in 2007 for raising funds for LTTE. The TNA delegation included R. Sampanthan, Joseph Pararajasingham (killed in Dec 2005), Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam. K P Reggie (Exec Director of TRO). Paying courtesy calls on a controversial Northern PC Member Fast forward to July 2023, the Canadian High Commissioner Eric Walsh was seen paying courtesy calls on a controversial Northern PC Member T. Raviharan, involved in a series of mischief and propagating vandalism and violence upon Buddhist heritage archaeological sites in the North of Sri Lanka. He has been at the forefront of protests & unruly behaviour in Kurundi, Gurukanda Raja Maha Viharaya. When questioned about the sudden visit, the Canadian High Commission claims that Eric Walsh’s visit was to ‘meet people in different parts of the country, to better understand their priorities and perspectives”. The below breakdown of the Canadian High Commissioners visits should give a good idea or the people he has met and the “priorities” that Canada is giving prominence to. It is baffling why the Canadian High Commission would want to go to Jaffna twice and in particular to meet with T. Raviharan whose name has been repeatedly appearing for causing ethno-religious tensions. It is reliably informed that the envoy is arranging a Colombo-meet of these unscrupulous elements with obviously a well-funded plan to increase the tempo of attacks on the Buddhist archaeological sites as they foresee this as one of the biggest obstacles to advancing the 13th Amendment and cutting the North & East out of Colombo control. The reason to raise concern about the Canadian High Commissioner’s visits primarily centres on the decisions by the Canadian Government. It is true that outside of Sri Lanka, Canada and in particular Toronto holds the largest number of Tamils. What is also true is that these numbers are mostly asylum seekers or refugees as the numbers do not tally with the 2021 Canadian census. Be that as it may, these pro-LTTE elements are making considerable influence over Canadian Parliamentarians. Domestic politics and funding appear to be a key reason to promote a bogus genocide claim and slap sanctions when no legal court has declared anyone guilty of war crimes and even UNHRC has failed to provide evidence of even the 40,000 dead that kicked off a global tarnishing campaign. Incidentally, Serbia was accused of the same number of dead and eventually that figure ended up only 2,500 or less. The war crimes/genocide hype resulted in imprisoning the Serbian President who died in jail before he was eventually exonerated and those who accused have yet to even apologise for putting a President in prison for no valid reason. This is clearly the same outcome for Sri Lanka. Mourning terrorists It is shocking that to satisfy domestic politics, a national government like Canada is happy to mourn terrorists that died in the last phase of the conflict while agreeing to declare genocide remembrance week as well as subject Canadian children to learn about a genocide that never took place. Years down the line, Canada will end up a laughing stock. We await the day Canada finds out to their embarrassment that they had been commemorating dead LTTE terrorists, genocide was to mourn LTTE dead and a genocide sans names of the dead/dead bodies or even skeletons. To cover up this, Canada is ranting about Mannar graves when the site is on the other end of where the conflict took place. Take a map and look at where Mannar and Mullaivaikkal is located, please. Canadian Parliament in 2022 declaring 18 May as Tamil Genocide Remembrance Day (the GoSL should request Canada to produce genocide figures, the names of dead at least) July 1983 statements by even the Canadian PM Trudeau display ignorance of facts. Ontario Bill 104 in 2023 – Tamil Genocide Education Week. Are these foreign envoys here to build bridges or to break existing bridges and kickstart new turmoils? If envoys are in Sri Lanka to help make peace, what they are presently doing is nowhere near this objective. An analysis of who they meet, what they discuss is testament to what they are really up to veil by their statements that ooze out peace, reconciliation and whatnot. It is a pity that the Sri Lanka Foreign Minister and Ministry are not keeping a tab on the diplomatic movements, interferences into internal affairs and the funding that is being channelled to lay grounds for new mischief. Nothing in the Geneva protocols covers the type of interference and incursions being committed with impunity by a handful of Western and Indian diplomats in Sri Lanka. It is a shame that the objectives and goals of diplomacy is being clouded by these actions and behaviours.

Director General of the Department of Census and Statistics, P.M.P. Anura Kumara, who will act as the Superintendent of Census, said his Department will handle technical activities of the listing stage. “The responsibility for administrative activities will be lie with the district and divisional administrations including the District Secretary. Accordingly, field work in the listing stage is being carried out with the participation of about 22,000 officers of the Department of Census and Statistics as well as the district and divisional administrations,” he added. The Department of Census and Statistics plans to list all buildings and census units during the latter part of 2023, and to conduct the fifteenth Census of population and Housing in 2024. The Superintendent said the census is an extensive and complex process, and  planning starts several years before the census is conducted. The United Nations published guidelines, principles, and concepts for conducting the census in each decade. “The census will be planned by adapting those guidelines to our country’s needs. In the census, the information should be collected, so that no person is omitted or counted twice. To achieve that objective, the census is conducted in four phases: mapping stage, listing stage, enumeration stage, and data dissemination stage,” he added. Preparation of maps, the first stage of the census, has now been completed and the entire country has been divided into smaller areas (enumeration areas) called Census Blocks. Accordingly, about 88,000 census blocks have been identified and mapped. The Department has developed a geo-database comprising accurate boundaries at the Grama Niladhari division level. “For the first time in Sri Lanka, tablet computers are being utilised to collect data instead of printed questionnaires. That method is called Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI- Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing). Further, additional information will be collected this time to the information collected in the listing phase of the previous censuses. That is, all  buildings will be numbered and their Global Positioning System (GPS) readings will also be obtained. Information on disaster situations faced is also collected,” it was said. The Information and Communication Technology Division of the Department of Census and Statistics has developed software and data systems required for the census. By Gagani Weerakoon"

The anticipated announcement came three days after his party again won all seats at an uncompetitive election. Hun Sen, 70, has become increasingly authoritarian after nearly four decades of rule in Cambodia. He first flagged a transition in 2021, but up to now no one knew exactly when it would take place. His eldest son, Hun Manet, until recently the Commander of the Royal Cambodian Army, has long been groomed for the role. In his announcement, Hun Sen said his son would be appointed Prime Minister on 10 August. “I would like to ask for understanding from the people as I announce that I will not continue as Prime Minister,” he said in a special broadcast on State television. He said he would be stepping down as staying in office could cause instability. However, he will retain leadership of the ruling Cambodian People’s Party – a position political analysts say still gives him ultimate control. Earlier on Wednesday, State media showed Hun Sen visiting the Cambodian monarch’s palace to announce the news of the dynastic succession. Hun Manet, 45, took a leading role in campaigning for the 23 July election this year – and was often spotted leading rallies next to his father, who has ruled the Southeast Asian nation of 16 million people since 1985. Sunday’s election was widely seen as a done deal, because the only credible Opposition party had been disqualified from the vote. There were 17 other parties on the ballot but they were all too small, new or aligned with the CPP to be considered a real alternative for voters. The US and the EU both released statements condemning the vote as neither free nor fair. Hun Sen’s elimination of political opponents is part of his wider crackdown on civil space in Cambodia in recent years. Having consistently crushed his opponents, in 2017 he used the courts to dissolve another popular opposition party, the CNRP, and jail or exile its leaders. (BBC)"

Charles emphasized the importance of taxes in improving State services and contributing to the country’s growth. She urged the people not to avoid paying taxes and instead consider them a crucial component in the nation’s development. Speaking at an event ‘Building a United Country’ held at Saraswathi Hall, on Tuesday (25) Governor Charles highlighted the need for people to understand the purpose of taxes and how they serve the interests of the country. She also said those who have emigrated from Jaffna and were living abroad are aware of the tax systems in those countries. By observing how taxes play a significant role in the income of those countries, people can better comprehend their importance. The Governor expressed concern about tax evasion and stressed that it is the responsibility of citizens to fulfill their tax obligations. She emphasized that, given the various needs of the country, paying taxes is crucial for its progress. Governor Charles also pointed out that only a small number of taxpayers contribute to the country’s economy, considering the total population. Additionally, the Governor touched upon the income tax collected by the Government, mentioning that the proportion of individuals who actually pay income tax is relatively small compared to the overall population of the country. This may imply that there is a significant tax gap or tax evasion issue in the country. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

It is said that before carrying out a kidney transplant the aforementioned drug has to be administered without failure to the patient concerned and via it the kidney that is transplanted is prevented from being rejected instantly. However, informed sources revealed a bottle containing the said drug costs around Rs 300,000 and it has been confirmed that the drug is unavailable in all hospitals which undertake kidney transplants. It is also stated that it is unavailable in private hospitals as well. According to sources, an alternative drug that is administered known as Antithymocyte is also unavailable in State hospitals but it is available in a few private hospitals. Antithymocyte has been priced at Rs 65,000 per bottle and it is administered to patients based on their weight. Hence, to administer the drug to certain patients a sum of Rs 400,000 has to be incurred. As the drug concerned is in short supply at the NINDT, they had requested the Medical Supply Unit to make available 12 vaccines of the drug urgently. They further informed that failure to grant the vaccines would force them to suspend surgeries forthwith. By yesterday (25), 10 patients had been on the waiting list for surgeries at the NINDT and sources revealed only two surgeries are conducted per week. By Vineetha M. Gamage"

On 27 August last year, the then 13-year-old Kalya Kandegoda Gamage was paddling on the Water’s Edge at Chrystalls Beach with his 11-year-old brother Kithmi. It was then that a large wave swept his younger brother off of his feet, and two more large waves pulled him into the water. Kithmi, who was a confident swimmer, tried to get back to shore but when he couldn’t, he continued to tread water. However, battling the 3-metre swells he was becoming tired as he was pulled further from shore. Kalya said it took several jumps to get into the bitterly cold surf, and while he was not scared on the way to his brother, who was now 60 m from shore, he was scared when he reached him, and the pair had to return. He was concerned that he and his brother might not make it back to shore, but was relieved when they did so, cold and tired. Kalya said he was happy the siblings did not die that day. Both were now more careful around the sea after their experience. The citation from the Royal Life Saving Society noted a comment from a local Police officer that “no one survives in that stretch of water, it is notoriously dangerous.” “Undoubtedly, Kalya’s brave response saved his brother’s life that day.” While long-term Kalya wanted to start a business or become an engineer, he also wanted to improve on the swimming skills and lifesaving training he undertook in his home country of Sri Lanka. Those life-saving skills meant Kalya qualified – and won – the 2022 Mountbatten Medal, which was awarded to just one member of the Commonwealth, each year. The now 14-year-old became the youngest person ever to win the bravery award. Kalya was presented with the medal at a special school assembly at the Milton-based Tokomairiro High School, with his principal Declan Sheridan telling Stuff that: “The school is very proud of Kalya’s achievements.” (www.stuff.co.nz)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The hosts, who were 76/2 at Stumps on Day 4, needed 289 to level the series. But persistent rain, which started overnight and continued into Monday (July 24), brought a damp end to the centennial Test between West Indies and India. Rain did relent for a while, and there were even glimpses of blue sky, as play was slated to begin at 1:15 pm local time, but it didn’t due to another spell of showers. Another revised start of 1:40 pm also did not materialise as it started raining again, and eventually it was curtains on the day’s play and the Test. India are currently ranked No.2 in the 2023-25 cycle of the World Test Championship, with four points from this drawn game taking their tally of points to 16, which has brought down their percentage of points to 66.66. West Indies register their first points on the board courtesy the drawn Test. Recapping the Test, the visitors were asked to bat first on Day 1 and Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal gave India a good platform as they raised their second successive century partnership. Rohit struck 80 while Jaiswal, having scored a century on debut, followed it up with a knock of 57, striking at over 75. West Indies hit back with quick wickets, leaving India in a spot at 182/4. Then followed Kohli’s 29th Test ton in his 500th international appearance as his 159-run partnership with Ravindra Jadeja (61) revived India. R Ashwin also delivered with the bat, scoring 56 to help the team post 438. Kraigg Brathwaite’s 75 off 235 led West Indies’ cautious reply as the visitors batted for 108 overs across Day 2 and Day 3 to be 229/5. But Mohammed Siraj’s maiden Test fifer opened up an avenue for India on Day 4 despite plenty of rain as the hosts were bowled out for 255. India then raced to 181/2 decl. in 24 overs, with Rohit registering his fastest fifty, and third in a row, while Ishan Kishan, promoted to No.4, brought up his maiden Test half-century. India made inroads in the fourth innings as West Indies went into Stumps on Day 4 at 76/2, which was also the final score as relentless rain forced a draw. India won the opening Test in Dominica by an innings and 141 runs to get their WTC campaign going, with Jaiswal’s 171 and Ashwin’s 12-wicket haul being the headline acts. The series now moves into the ODI mode with the first two ODIs in Barbados on July 27 and 29, while the third ODI will be played in Trinidad on August 1. This will be followed by a five-match T20I series from August 3 to 13. Brief scores: India 438 (Virat Kohli 121, Rohit Sharma 80; Jomel Warrican 3-89) & 181/2 decl.

The meeting also saw the participation of Dinouk Colombage, the President’s Director of International Affairs, further underscoring Sri Lanka’s commitment to regional cooperation and engagement within BIMSTEC."

The project, initiated in 2021, was meant to benefit the community by boosting the local economy and generating income for the Government. However, the centre remains unused and in a state of disarray as it has not been officially handed over to the public. Despite a substantial investment of Rs 8 million for the construction of the ornamental fish breeding project, along with additional cash assistance ranging from Rs 100,000 to Rs 60,000 provided by the Government, the tanks and buildings intended for the project’s use are now falling into disrepair. The residents assert that not a single ornamental fish has been bred or placed in the tanks. On inquiry, Dimbulagala Divisional Secretary P.T.M. Irfan explained that the project encountered difficulties due to the Covid-19 pandemic that emerged shortly after its launch in 2021.  Consequently, the cost of construction and production escalated beyond the initial estimation of Rs 8 million. To expedite the project, Irfan personally contributed Rs 250,000, which he is yet to be reimbursed for. He emphasised that accusations of mismanagement are unfounded and asserted that once the remaining funds are received, the project will be completed as planned. Moreover, authorities are investigating whether the individuals who received financial aid, ranging from Rs 100,000 to Rs 60,000, for building net gear and tanks have utilised the funds for the intended purposes. If any misappropriation is uncovered, appropriate action will be taken to rectify the situation, he said. By Nimal Jayaratne – Manampitiya"

Dewagala Deva Lankara Thera, the former Secretary of the Batticaloa Sasanaarakshaka Balamandala and Chief Incumbent of the Kalkudah Sri Seelalankara Pirivena, has expressed concern over the damage caused to the largest Stupa (Dagaba) constructed during the Anuradhapura period. The Stupa, situated at Mawadiwembu Division in the Chenkalady Divisional Secretariat of Eravurpattu, in the Batticaloa District, has suffered significant harm at the hands of grave diggers and treasure hunters. According to Ven. Dewagala Deva Lankara Thera, the Stupa, believed to have been built during the second or third Century BC, holds immense historical importance. The Ampara Office of the Archaeological Department had recognised it as a monument with historical value around six years ago. However, the Ven. Thera revealed that treasure hunters had desecrated the Stupa, removing invaluable items in the process. It was alleged that the treasure hunters claimed the location belonged to a Kovil. The monk has urged the officers from the Department of Archaeology to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident.  He seeks accountability from the treasure hunters responsible for the damages caused to the Stupa and calls for its restoration to its former glory. Preserving and protecting such historical sites is essential to maintain Sri Lanka’s rich cultural heritage. BY Nimal Jayaratne – Manampitiya"

According to data, only Sri Lanka and Nepal are yet to bounce back to pre-Covid vaccination standards while Pakistan is the highest to reach that level with 93 per cent achievement. UNICEF, in a press release, said immunisation services in South Asia reached 1.96 million more children in 2022 compared to the previous year, as countries stepped up efforts to address the historic backsliding in immunisation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and save children’s lives.  According to data published yesterday by UNICEF and the World Health Organisation (WHO), in 2022, the coverage of the third dose of the Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus vaccine (DTP3) increased by six percentage points, from 85 per cent in 2021 to 91 per cent in South Asia. The DTP vaccine is used as the global marker for immunisation coverage.  “South Asia’s progress to catch up with life-saving vaccinations is tremendous news for the children in the region who now have a better chance of being protected against deadly diseases such as measles, tetanus and more,” said UNICEF Deputy Regional Director for South Asia, Noala Skinner. “We owe this progress to the leadership of countries, the investment of donors and partners, tenacity of millions of vaccinaters and the commitment of parents to get their children vaccinated despite several challenges during and after the Covid-19 pandemic waves.” Among the eight South Asian countries, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, India and the Maldives have fully recovered to their pre Covid-19 coverage levels. Sri Lanka and Nepal have made significant strides towards achieving complete recovery but are yet to fully catch-up.  Though progress has been made in Afghanistan, more efforts are needed to reach over 400,000 missing children with vaccination services. All countries, except Afghanistan and Pakistan, achieved vaccine coverage of above 90 per cent for DTP3, which is considered very high.  According to the data, in 2022, India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal had the highest percentage reductions in the number of children who weren’t vaccinated at all, with a decrease of 58 per cent, 50 per cent and 38 per cent respectively. In India, the number of children without any vaccines decreased from 2.7 million in 2021 to 1.13 million in 2022.  The percentage of children vaccinated with the new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which protect children against pneumonia, jumped 28 percentage points from 44 in 2021 to 72 per cent in 2022.  Vaccination for the first vaccine dose against measles – one of the most contagious vaccine preventable diseases – increased from 87 per cent in 2021 to 92 per cent in 2022. This was higher than the two percentage point increase globally.  As a result, an additional 1.94 million children were vaccinated against the deadly disease in South Asia in 2022.  However, the regional coverage for the first dose of measles vaccine is still lower than the target of 95 per cent needed to prevent measles outbreaks. According to the WHO surveillance data, in 2022 alone, there were 54,959 measles cases in South Asia, nearly triple the reported cases in 2021. "

According to data, only Sri Lanka and Nepal are yet to bounce back to pre-Covid vaccination standards while Pakistan is the highest to reach that level with 93 per cent achievement. UNICEF, in a press release, said immunisation services in South Asia reached 1.96 million more children in 2022 compared to the previous year, as countries stepped up efforts to address the historic backsliding in immunisation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and save children’s lives.  According to data published yesterday by UNICEF and the World Health Organisation (WHO), in 2022, the coverage of the third dose of the Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus vaccine (DTP3) increased by six percentage points, from 85 per cent in 2021 to 91 per cent in South Asia. The DTP vaccine is used as the global marker for immunisation coverage.  “South Asia’s progress to catch up with life-saving vaccinations is tremendous news for the children in the region who now have a better chance of being protected against deadly diseases such as measles, tetanus and more,” said UNICEF Deputy Regional Director for South Asia, Noala Skinner. “We owe this progress to the leadership of countries, the investment of donors and partners, tenacity of millions of vaccinaters and the commitment of parents to get their children vaccinated despite several challenges during and after the Covid-19 pandemic waves.” Among the eight South Asian countries, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, India and the Maldives have fully recovered to their pre Covid-19 coverage levels. Sri Lanka and Nepal have made significant strides towards achieving complete recovery but are yet to fully catch-up.  Though progress has been made in Afghanistan, more efforts are needed to reach over 400,000 missing children with vaccination services. All countries, except Afghanistan and Pakistan, achieved vaccine coverage of above 90 per cent for DTP3, which is considered very high.  According to the data, in 2022, India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal had the highest percentage reductions in the number of children who weren’t vaccinated at all, with a decrease of 58 per cent, 50 per cent and 38 per cent respectively. In India, the number of children without any vaccines decreased from 2.7 million in 2021 to 1.13 million in 2022.  The percentage of children vaccinated with the new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which protect children against pneumonia, jumped 28 percentage points from 44 in 2021 to 72 per cent in 2022.  Vaccination for the first vaccine dose against measles – one of the most contagious vaccine preventable diseases – increased from 87 per cent in 2021 to 92 per cent in 2022. This was higher than the two percentage point increase globally.  As a result, an additional 1.94 million children were vaccinated against the deadly disease in South Asia in 2022.  However, the regional coverage for the first dose of measles vaccine is still lower than the target of 95 per cent needed to prevent measles outbreaks. According to the WHO surveillance data, in 2022 alone, there were 54,959 measles cases in South Asia, nearly triple the reported cases in 2021. "

According to the old records and chronicles of the mission, Richmond College is the oldest school, founded by the Wesleyan missionaries in Ceylon, as far back as 25 July 1814.  The signature book of ‘Forgotten History of Richmond College’ by the late Ananda Dias Jayasingha, after meticulous research, traced the history of Richmond College to 1814. Traditionally, the College celebrates its anniversaries on the 1 May each year since 1876.  However, it was established that the College was upgraded into a high school only on this particular day in 1876. This claim was endorsed by ProfessorK. D. Paranawithana, Professor G.V.P. Somarathna, Professor Michael Roberts and also the old Richmondite Professor P.V.J. Jayasekera. Therefore, Richmond College, Galle was officially founded on 25 July 1814.  This acclaimed book ‘Forgotten History of Richmond College’ written by the late Ananda Jayasingha has been endowed with the State literary award, the Southern Province Governor’s award, and the library authorisation of the Department of Education. Even the British High Commissioner in Colombo, in a special congratulatory message, on the occasion of the 208th anniversary, acknowledged the fact that Richmond College is the oldest Methodist School in Sri Lanka and has been in existence since 1814. According to the findings of this research, one of the pioneer members of the Wesleyan Mission, Rev Benjamin Cloff, who sailed the seas, first opened a school by the name of ‘Galle School’ in a mansion in Galle Fort called ‘Doornberg’ which belonged to the Dutch era. This school commissioned by the Wesleyan mission on 25 July 1814 was the forerunner to the present-day Richmond College. The evolution of the College to what it is today is a great piece of history that is worth delving into. Today, this monumental school, fashioned by British architecture, is majestically nestled on a beautiful hillock. Richmond College has so far produced two heads of State, namely Dr. Wijayananda Dahanayake, former premier, and Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Executive President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka from 2005 to 2015. Richmond’s connection to the political echelons of the country has been deep-rooted. Even incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s paternal grandfather, the late C.L Wickremesinghe was a prominent Richmondite. He was the first Ceylonese Civil Servant towards the tail-end of the British regime and ascended to become a Government Agent and Commissioner of Lands in his illustrious career. A number of President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s family members attended Richmond College and the Scout Troop House, Lecture Theatre, and kindergarten of Richmond were the magnanimous contributions of his family lineage.  Besides, the founder of space law, Dr. Jasenthuliyana is a living legend produced by Richmond. In line with Richmond’s historic heritage, a thanks-giving service is scheduled to be conducted at the Methodist Church in the precinct of the College. This year, it will be conducted by the retired Methodist Bishop and old Richmondite Ven. Asiri Perera at1.00 p.m. on 25 July 2023.  As this church was declared an archeologically protected site through a Gazette Notification issued by the government, it signifies the historic value that the State has attached to it. The organisers extend an open invitation to all past Richmondites to participate in this epoch-making occasion. By Lasitha Mendis and Nalaka Jayasena"

It was held at the Official Residence of the Ambassador to present opportunities for collaborations in trade, investment and tourism in Sri Lanka among the potential Turkish business community. The event was organised in three segments, namely: ‘Trade with Sri Lanka’, ‘Investing in Sri Lanka’ and ‘Sri Lanka Tourism’. Delivering the welcome address, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Türkiye Hasanthi Urugodawatte Dissanayake stated that 2023 is a special year for the two countries; celebrating the 100th anniversary of founding of the Turkish Republic, Sri Lanka celebrating its 75th anniversary of independence as well as the two countries celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations. She underscored that the activities commemorating these cornerstones contribute in promoting bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Türkiye. The Ambassador also gave a brief introduction to Sri Lanka and highlighted the similarities in trade for over two millennia between Türkiye and Sri Lanka, with Türkiye being an important part of ancient trade routes connecting east and west over the land and while Sri Lanka was part of the sea trade route. She further noted that both countries have rich cultural influences due to being strategic locations on trade routes for a very long time. Therefore, it is no surprise that in 1864 the Ottoman Empire appointed a Honorary Consul in Sri Lanka. In his opening speech, Chairman of the Türkiye-Sri Lanka Business Council Mehmet Ali Uğur briefly explained about the activities of the Türkiye – Sri Lanka Business Council which started in 2014 and its contributions to the improvement of bilateral commercial relations between the two countries. He highlighted that Sri Lanka’s potential is not yet known adequately in Türkiye and thus the aim of the Business Council is to improve relations between the two countries with more awareness on opportunities that exist in the two countries, paving the way for enhancing economic cooperation of mutual benefit. He highlighted that Turkish business people should take a note of Sri Lanka’s strategic location and focus more on Sri Lanka and the region. The Head of Department of Asia and Pacific Countries, General Directorate of International Agreements and EU at the Ministry of Trade of Türkiye Çağatay Özden attended the event as the guest of honour. Özden emphasised how the bilateral relations and interactions have developed since the opening of the Embassies in Ankara and in Colombo and stated that there is a great potential to further strengthen trade relations. Minister (Commercial) at the Sri Lanka Embassy in Türkiye Thavishya Mullegamgoda delivered a presentation on Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan product basket for export such as apparel, tea, spices, spa & herbal products, coconut & coir-based products, gems, food & beverages, fisheries products etc. The presentation also detailed potential collaborations for investments in tourism, agriculture production and energy sector among others. During an experience sharing session in doing business with Sri Lanka, General Manager of BETA Gıda Sanayive Ticaret A.Ş. in Türkiye Mehmet Ali Uğur shared his company’s successful experience dating back to the 1980’s. He praised the quality of Ceylon tea, tourism industry, and stressed the importance of the Colombo Port City project. He added that considering Sri Lanka’s close proximity to modern day Sea Lines of Communications (SLOCs), Colombo being one of the busiest ports in Asia, as well as the various trade agreements that Sri Lanka has with many countries, particularly in the South and South East Asia, a Turkish investor can have access to a much larger market than the 22 million market share in Sri Lanka. He added that he visions that Sri Lanka would be a thriving financial hub between Singapore and Dubai very soon. Advisory Board Member of Penthol Group of Companies based in Istanbul Aydin Ozu, Türkiye spoke of his experience in the energy sector, stating that Sri Lanka could be considered as a suitable country for investments in energy projects especially in the renewable energy sector.

He made these statements at a ceremony held on 13 July 2023 to mark the French National Day, in Colombo.  Historical connections between Sri Lanka and France that date  back to the 17th century were  strengthened and consolidated with the establishment of formal diplomatic relations on 27 October 1948. This year, holds significance to both countries as they celebrate the 75th Anniversary of Sri Lanka – France diplomatic relations. “At present,  both our governments share an abiding commitment to transform this cooperation into a multifaceted partnership. Therefore, I take this opportunity to convey Sri Lanka’s deep appreciation to the French Government for playing a pivotal supporting role in our way forward for economic stabilisation, recovery and growth, and particularly in securing the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the IMF in its capacity as the Chair of the Paris Club,” the Minister said. He also emphasised that bilateral trade and investment between the two countries had much potential for expansion. France was the 10th export destination for Sri Lanka in 2022, with total exports recorded at USD 257 M. France is one of Sri Lanka’s  important tourism source markets and is also  the second largest provider of grant assistance to Sri Lanka that has become a major partner in Sri Lanka’s  development process. “I firmly believe that our economic relations will continue to strengthen in the years ahead and I hope more French companies would consider setting up their businesses in Sri Lanka to tap into the vast South Asian market and beyond. “Sri Lanka deeply appreciates French development assistance, received mainly through the AFD (Agence Française de Development) which supports infrastructure development, energy, water and sanitation projects, blue economy, disaster management and entrepreneurship in the country,” the Minister said. Speaking further, the Minister said:“Our bilateral maritime cooperation has continued to flourish over the recent years. The proposed establishment of a Regional Maritime Safety and Security School in Sri Lanka, France’s confirmed participation in the Galle Dialogue to be convened later this year are evidence of the current robust partnership that we share in the maritime sector. As France is a member country of the IORA (Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation), Sri Lanka wishes to engage more closely with France during Sri Lanka’s chairmanship of IORA from 2023 to 2025. I take this opportunity to reaffirm Sri Lanka’s commitment to build further on the friendship and cooperation between our two countries. I am confident that together with the efforts of Ambassador Jean Francois Pactet and his staff, we would succeed in strengthening our excellent bilateral relations and taking it to the next step forward.” French influence in Sri Lanka is reflected in art, music, architecture, literature, cinema, radio broadcasting and particularly in education.  The French missionaries’ contribution to the education system of Sri Lanka especially in the establishment of several leading Catholic schools in the country is noteworthy. The French language is sought after in High School and University curricular here, as well.  The Alliance Francaise which continuous its vibrant presence in Sri Lanka with branches in Kandy, Galle, Matara and Jaffna has for several decades contributed to the enhancement of the French culture in the country particularly with the younger generation. An additional dimension of Sri Lanka’s bilateral relations with France is the overseas community of Sri Lankan heritage now residing in France. This community while contributing productively to the French economy has been a strong element in strengthening people to people interactions. The number of students studying in French Universities also continue to rise. To mark the commemoration of  the 75th anniversary of Sri Lanka – France diplomatic relations in a fitting manner, a commemorative stamp along with the convening of inaugural bilateral political consultations will also be issued jointly.  A series of cultural engagements will also be held  to celebrate the abiding friendship between the  two nations."

The event will start on 28 July 2023, commencing from Talaimannar and culminating in Matale on 12 August 2023, passing through Nalanda along the way. This Padayatra carries profound meaning as it pays homage to the historical ties between India and Sri Lanka, celebrating the rich cultural heritage and invaluable contributions of the upcountry Tamil community over the past two centuries within the country. The journey and events from Talaimannar to Matale are meticulously organised by the ‘Collective for ‘Maanbumigu Malaiyaha Makkal’, a collaboration comprising the National Christian Council of Sri Lanka and a diverse group of Civil Society Organisations and Individuals closely associated with the Malaiyaha community. Reverends S. Devadasan, M. Saminathan, along with Daniel Jesudasan and J. Suresh are the organisers of this event. The purpose of this Padayatra is to retrace the arduous journey of the initial groups of men and women who were brought to Sri Lanka to work in the plantations of the hill country. More than two centuries ago, thousands of South Indians arrived in Talaimannar and courageously embarked on foot to Matale, facing diseases, jungle clearance and encounters with wild animals. Tragically, a significant number, up to 40 per cent in some cases, perished along the way and were either buried or disposed of during this perilous trek. The organisers extend an invitation to all to join in this remarkable journey, a pilgrimage to reflect upon and connect with the first generation who undertook this challenging expedition 200 years ago. Beyond honoring the past, the ‘Malaiyaha Ezhuchchi Payanam’ also represents hope for the future, encapsulating the demand of the Malaiyaha Tamil community to be recognised as free and equal citizens of Sri Lanka. Since their arrival two centuries ago, the community has faced numerous struggles, continually appealing to successive Sri Lankan Governments for recognition and equal treatment as a distinct and integral people of Sri Lanka, on par with other main communities. This underscores the community’s unwavering pursuit of identity as a constituent people of independent Sri Lanka, deserving equal rights and recognition. The core objective of this Padayatra is to foster a deeper understanding among various communities, including Sinhalese, Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims, and other fellow citizens, about the history, struggles, achievements, contributions, current socio-economic and political status, as well as the aspirations of the MalaiyahaTamil community.

Chanaka revealed yesterday (23). Addressing a media briefing at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), Chanaka said, “Until now, the fuel price formula existed only for Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). Instead, steps will be taken to set a maximum retail price using the price formula, to be applicable to all companies through this new system. Thus, the Ministry will decide on the maximum retail price in the future. These companies will then be able to provide fuel at a price of their choice subject to the maximum price. This will create competition among fuel companies resulting in reduced fuel prices.” Also, discussions will be initiated with relevant parties to decide whether to increase the existing fuel quota to each vehicle category or completely abolish the QR Code system, he said. “Previously, there were no arrangements to maintain buffer reserves. So far, steps have been taken to maintain a reserve of 30,000 litres of fuel including petrol and diesel. We are in charge of additional USD 60 million in addition to the money needed for daily expenses. After studying the existing methods in the world, a new method was introduced in this country. Accordingly, we no longer pay any advance. Fuel tankers coming to Sri Lanka should be fully stocked in our warehouses. After that, the necessary purchases for the week are made with the dollars available in the CPC. There are several advantages here. Risk fees were completely eliminated. This new system has the potential to save USD 300 million per year,” the State Minister said. “We only paid late fees previously. But as of now for the first time, we have earned 13 million dollars in late fees from fuel companies in just the first half of this year. The first instalment of USD 3 million is being collected before 18 August. The remaining USD 10 million will be recovered from the suppliers”, he added. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The second was held in Kandy from 20 to 21 July 2023. According to the CEA and CSE, a though there were Laws under the National Environmental Act, implementing these laws was a challenge.   To implement the EIA for prescribed development projects, data collection, impact assessment study, the preparation of the EIA report, and implementation of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to facilitate compliance monitoring have to be executed in full spirit. When implementing, the EIA process the responsibility lies with stakeholders, the CEA, and the project proponent. There is also a need to improve the quality of the EIA report since decisions are made on recommendation of the EIA report.  Keeping this in mind, the CEA and the CSE conducted a workshop cum capacity building programme to enhance the knowledge of environmental regulators to ensure better implementation of EIA in Sri Lanka.  The two-day training programme showed regulators on how environmental impacts are identified and how to review EIA reports and preparation of EMP explaining some case studies from India were included in the programme.  In addition, there was a special lecture on the accreditation scheme for EIA consultants by Nivit Kumar Yadav, Director, CSE, India which is not practised in Sri Lanka. “Sri Lanka has strong environmental laws to implement the EIA process. However, there are some gaps which need to be addressed to achieve the standards of the best international practices.  Accordingly, proper data systems, good quality EIA reports, development of proper review systems, to evaluate EIA reports, enhancing the involvement of civil society, and compliance of approved projects through well-prepared EMPs were essential. Sri Lanka needs to improve transparency when it comes to environmental compliance which will push industries to take extra measures to comply with statutory norms” said Nivit Kumar Yadav. Supun S.

Speaking to the media on 22 July at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), Ali Sabry said President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s desire is to make the most of the development opportunities in the Indian Ocean region, which is the world’s largest emerging economic region. “Today, no country can advance by itself and every developed country in the world has made progress through regional partnerships, the Minister said, adding that the President’s programme is to fulfill the development expectations of Sri Lanka by developing Indo-Sri Lankan relations in a manner that benefits both parties and does not threaten them,” he said. Emphasising that the President nor the Government will do anything that threatens the country, the Minister said it was the Government’s aim to implement these activities with the full understanding and agreement of all parties. “We firmly believe that fostering a robust and enduring relationship with our close and long-standing partner, India, holds significant advantage for both Sri Lanka and the entire region. Acknowledging the prevailing consensus that approximately 2/3 of the world’s total growth will unfold in the Asia Pacific region over the next few decades, it is widely recognised that India and China will play pivotal roles in leading this growth. In the light of these realities, President Wickramasinghe said the need to capitalise on the vast development opportunities presented by the Indian Ocean region was immense. Drawing parallels with successful models in the European Union, Middle Eastern countries, China, and the North American region, we are determined to harness similar development dynamics.” The Minister said both President Wickremesinghe and Indian Premier Narendra Modi recognised the strategic importance of connecting ports to ensure Sri Lanka could leverage economic growth in Tamil Nadu, Andhra, and Telangana. Scholars are actively engaged in discussions to devise a framework to set up these port connections, leading to a consensus among leaders to present it to Parliament for a decision. Anticipating that renewable energy could meet 70 per cent of our country’s national electricity needs by 2030, we are keen to explore the market potential for exporting surplus energy. Deliberations on creating a conducive environment for the export of solar and wind power were extensive, culminating in a memorandum of understanding to facilitate collaborative efforts. Furthermore, opportunities for cooperation in green hydrogen and green ammonia through innovative technologies were explored, he said. Speaking further, Ali Sabry said, “In recognition of the significance of technical knowledge for the advancement of our agricultural sector, a memorandum of understanding was signed to acquire expertise in various fields, including animal husbandry and dairy production. Appreciating India’s substantial progress in digitisation, we sought technical assistance to accelerate our own digitisation efforts in Sri Lanka. Turning our attention to the plantation Tamil community of Indian origin residing in Sri Lanka for the past two centuries, India has expressed its commitment to implementing several programmes aimed at their progress, with a notable investment of INR 750 million. The prospect of establishing a university in the Nuwara Eliya area was also a subject of discussion, paving the way for future agreements.” The Minister said attention was paid to concerns of the fishing community, with a focus on gradually halting bottom trawlers in the North and seeking opportunities for Sri Lankan fishermen to operate beyond the Indian border. Constructive dialogue between the two parties remains the cornerstone for resolving these issues, he added. Both sides unanimously agreed on the imperative of maintaining the entire Indian Ocean region as a safe zone, acting collectively with the utmost commitment to safeguard mutual security, he further added."

The President said it was regrettable thatalthough we are entitled to a proud civilisation and history, we  were not paying enough attention to this legacy while other countries continue to emphasise their historical civilisation. “A new law pertaining to Anuradhapura should be prepared to preserve the city’s historical legacy. Additionally, a Committee is anticipated to be set up to carry out this activity with officials. Despite the existence of Departments and Corporations, this work is not overseen by a single administrative officer. We should focus on that as well. If we start this project now, we can achieve some progress in the next 10 years, but it will take at least 25 years to complete it. When these operations begin, Sri Lanka will develop into an archaeological hub,” the President pointed out. The President questioned officials about the identification of the MahaViharaya complex boundaries and the status of excavation work. He also inquired about the number of archaeological officers employed in the excavation and the development of the Sacred Site, the composition, and the allocated provisions.

According to them, last season, they were paid Rs 235 per kg for raw tea leaves. Unfortunately, the situation has worsened, and this month, they are receiving only Rs 110 per kg. This sharp decline in payment is attributed to several factors, including the decrease in the value of the dollar and the unrelenting costs of fertilisers, vitamins, and medicines used for tea trees. Despite the reduction in payments from merchants who buy the raw tea leaves, the expenses including labour allowances amount to approximately Rs 150 per kg, leaving them unable to cover the losses incurred by selling tea leaves at Rs 110 per kg, they alleged. Another critical issue raised by small tea plantation owners is the importation of ready-made tea from countries like India and Malaysia, which is then exported under the name of ‘Ceylon’ by large-scale businessmen. This practice has had a detrimental impact on the local tea industry, leading to further challenges for small tea estate owners. Moreover, the industry is grappling with the problem of large-scale smuggling, resulting in the production of waste tea that is processed using chemicals. This illicit activity is said to be prevalent in areas like Ambalangoda and Welamboda, exacerbating the crisis faced by small tea plantation owners, the tea plantation owners alleged.

In response to these concerns, the Sri Lankan delegation received assurance from the ship-owner interests and insurers that the assessment of these claims would be carried out promptly and efficiently. The Attorney General, representing the Government of Sri Lanka, emphasised the urgency of concluding the ongoing wreck decommissioning and debris recovery operations within Sri Lankan waters. The insurers of the ship-owner interests responded positively to this plea, indicating their cooperation in addressing this issue.

Diplomatic relations between our two countries were established in 1956 and both countries have continued to enjoy over six decades of good relations based on a foundation of common values such as democracy and open economic policies. Our steadfast bilateral engagement is anchored in high-level exchanges, strong trade relations, people-to-people contacts and development cooperation. Sri Lanka welcomes the support extended by Switzerland as a member of the Paris Club in securing the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the IMF to Sri Lanka as well as the provision of assistance through UN agencies and the World Food Programme towards people impacted by the economic situation. Our trade ties are strong. Switzerland is among the top 20 destinations for Sri Lankan exports. We welcome the fact that the Swiss Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) facility allows many Sri Lankan products to be exported tariff-free to the Swiss market. There is immense potential for further expansion of trade between the two countries. Investments from Switzerland over the years have contributed well to Sri Lanka’s economic growth. Swiss companies are particularly active in Sri Lanka’s Agriculture, Food and Construction Sectors contributing to the development of the relevant industries, while generating employment opportunities for thousands of Sri Lankans. We hope to see more Swiss investments in sectors such as Tourism and Pharmaceutical manufacturing in the coming years. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation has been active in Sri Lanka since 2000, providing humanitarian aid, helping with reconstruction and uplifting the lives of thousands of Sri Lankans for years. We appreciate the fact that since 2010, Switzerland has been supporting the Safe Labour Migration Programme (SLMP) in Sri Lanka. It has cushioned the adverse impacts of labour migration while increasing the contribution made to sound policy priorities. The successful conclusion of the 2nd Expert Meeting on Migration Partnership between Sri Lanka and Switzerland last May in Colombo is a testament to the commitment of both our countries towards continued cooperation in migration matters.  Sri Lanka and Switzerland have also enjoyed a vibrant people-to-people exchange, with many Sri Lankans and people of Sri Lankan heritage living and working in Switzerland, and many Swiss tourists visiting Sri Lanka. We also appreciate the cultural exchange programmes conducted by the Swiss Embassy in Colombo such as showcasing Swiss Artists at the Fairway Galle Literary Festival and the contemporary Art Exhibition Colomboscope in cooperation with Pro Helvetia New Delhi. The organisation of film festivals in Sri Lanka, such as the European Film Festival, the Francophone Film Festival, Cinema on the Road, the Jaffna International Cinema Festival and the Colombo International Women’s Film Festival have expanded our outreach in cultural cooperation. Sri Lanka and Switzerland face common challenges in the 21st Century, such as Climate Change, Terrorism, and Food and Energy Security. The strong and steadily advancing partnership between our two countries gives us confidence in tackling these challenges together. We look forward to working with our Swiss friends to promote Sri Lanka-Switzerland bilateral ties to even greater heights. “I would be remiss in my duties today if I don’t say a few words about Ambassador Furgler who is about to conclude his tour of duty in Sri Lanka. “Ambassador Furgler, your services in Sri Lanka in the past three years is much appreciated not only because of your professionalism and Cordiality but also for the significant contributions made to broaden the vistas of our cooperation. We all enjoyed your hospitality and the kind relations that you and your wife Hayam established with Sri Lanka. We will miss you both. Thank you again and wishing you both the best for all your engagements and a wonderful retirement”."

With a nearly 40% drop in paddy production in 2022, Sri Lanka’s rice ecosystem is vulnerable and requires immediate attention. To combat this issue, FAO has initiated an innovative project titled RiceUP, with funding of €4 million from the European Union (EU). As part of this project, FAO and its partners are conducting training programmes for Agriculture Extension Officers (AEOs) on Integrated Plant Nutrient Management (IPNM) in four districts: Ampara, Badulla, Hambantota, and Polonnaruwa. The training will equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to guide paddy farmers on soil management and the optimal use of organic and chemical fertilisers to enhance crop yield, while reducing chemical dependency. The initial training session for Agriculture Extension Officers (AEOs) on IPNM practices was launched yesterday at the Rice Research and Development Institute in Batalagoda. This session marks the beginning of a series of five training programmes, aiming to train a total of 300 AEOs from the selected districts. The Training Manual developed collaboratively with international and national consultants, the Department of Agriculture, MASL, and the University of Peradeniya will serve as the cornerstone of these training sessions. IPNM is a sustainable land management practice that ensures soil quality, prevents degradation, and maximises crop productivity, while safeguarding the environment. FAO’s induction of IPNM, coupled with the provision of urea fertiliser to smallholder farmers in selected districts, is a response to the challenges faced by farmers in accessing essential fertilisers and maintaining food security. By adopting IPNM and accessing urea fertiliser, smallholder paddy farmers can reduce costs and improve productivity, leading to better profitability and resilience to future shocks. Through the implementation of sustainable farming practices, including the safe and efficient use of fertiliser and quality seed, RiceUP aims to enhance productivity, food security, and livelihoods in Sri Lanka’s paddy farming sector. Together with its partners, FAO remains dedicated to ensuring the long-term sustainability and resilience of Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector."

MCPA President, Chamal Sanjeeva, yesterday (20), accused an Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry, of lying regarding the number of medicinal drugs which had been removed from use during a media briefing. “Not just two drugs, but close to 500 types of substandard drugs and equipment have been removed from use since 2019, he said, noting that this was clearly stated on the website of the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) of the Ministry of Health. Health officials continue to give out false information to the public. Merely changing the Minister of Health would not suffice under such circumstances. It is clear that not only the Health Minister, but such officials too should be removed,” he said. Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Dr. Saman Ratnayake, speaking to the media, said on Wednesday (19), that some of the Health Ministry’s warehouses had drugs that had failed quality control for years. There had been complications with eye drops that had been used at the National Eye Hospital and District General Hospital Nuwara Eliya post-eye surgery. That medicine contained bacteria. “We have stopped all other medicines temporarily. Until that investigation is over,” Dr. Ratnayake explained at the time. The MCPA President noted that when he had revealed there was malnourishment in the country last year, Minister Rambukwella had refuted such claims in Parliament stating that they were baseless. However, without any shame, he himself had to reverse his claims noting that at least one million of the country’s population were malnourished. Had the Minister carried out a proper follow-up based on the facts revealed by the MCPA in September last year, the nutritional situation in the country would have been more controlled by now, he lamented. Recollecting the facts given out by him regarding the situation of malnourishment prevailing in Sooriyawewa, Hambantota District, Dr. Sanjeeva said, at the time Rambukwella, making a statement in Parliament which had been written by the Director of Health Services for Hambantota District and the Health Secretary said there was no malnutrition in Hambantota nor in any other part of the country. Lashing out, he said the Minister of Health should be ashamed to continue lying and presenting false information to the public and the media hiding behind parliamentary privileges. “According to the Health Ministry, 300,000 children under the age of five and 700,000 women suffered from malnutrition. This situation could also be seen in the Western, Central, North-Western and Uva Provinces. The Health Ministry has to explain how it utilised nearly Rs 500 million allocated for the rural people from the last Budget when the funds could have been utilised to address such issues,” the MCPA President said.

The Minister added that she hopes to address this issue with short, medium and long-term goals and objectives. She expressed these views today (19), during a Press Conference themed ‘Collective Path to a Stable Country’ held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). Elaborating further the Minister said: “Our Ministry has prioritised resolving HEC as soon as possible. Our aim is to provide related solutions through short, medium and long-term plans. So far, the Ministry has conducted several workshops to provide guidance and direction towards this end. “By incorporating the earlier measures and efforts to manage HEC, it has now become necessary to establish a permanent strategy for this. The Policy will then be turned into law after that. We are confident that by doing this, we will be able to permanently end HEC. “80% of the land in this country is owned by the State, while about 20% is owned by the public. The population of the country is growing day-by-day. Also, the habitats and paths of wild elephants are now occupied by people for various development activities. “Some believe that the ‘Elephant Fence’ is a solution to prevent wild elephants from invading villages. Given the current financial situation of the country, it will take some time to complete these activities. “It must be mentioned that immediately after learning that Agbo, the Elephant was injured, the Wildlife Department took prompt action to provide medical treatment. Even now, the elephant is under doctors’ due care and medical treatment. So far, there are no impediments with regard to finances and/or providing medicine for treatment and speedy recovery of the injured elephant. Therefore, no one should raise issues concerning the welfare of  Agbo. I wish to reiterate that the government is making every effort to safeguard the elephant’s life”."

Diplomatic relations between our two countries were established in 1956 and both countries have continued to enjoy over six decades of good relations based on a foundation of common values such as democracy and open economic policies. Our steadfast bilateral engagement is anchored in high-level exchanges, strong trade relations, people-to-people contacts and development cooperation. Sri Lanka welcomes the support extended by Switzerland as a member of the Paris Club in securing the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the IMF to Sri Lanka as well as the provision of assistance through UN agencies and the World Food Programme towards people impacted by the economic situation. Our trade ties are strong. Switzerland is among the top 20 destinations for Sri Lankan exports. We welcome the fact that the Swiss Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) facility allows many Sri Lankan products to be exported tariff-free to the Swiss market. There is immense potential for further expansion of trade between the two countries. Investments from Switzerland over the years have contributed well to Sri Lanka’s economic growth. Swiss companies are particularly active in Sri Lanka’s Agriculture, Food and Construction Sectors contributing to the development of the relevant industries, while generating employment opportunities for thousands of Sri Lankans. We hope to see more Swiss investments in sectors such as Tourism and Pharmaceutical manufacturing in the coming years. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation has been active in Sri Lanka since 2000, providing humanitarian aid, helping with reconstruction and uplifting the lives of thousands of Sri Lankans for years. We appreciate the fact that since 2010, Switzerland has been supporting the Safe Labour Migration Programme (SLMP) in Sri Lanka. It has cushioned the adverse impacts of labour migration while increasing the contribution made to sound policy priorities. The successful conclusion of the 2nd Expert Meeting on Migration Partnership between Sri Lanka and Switzerland last May in Colombo is a testament to the commitment of both our countries towards continued cooperation in migration matters.  Sri Lanka and Switzerland have also enjoyed a vibrant people-to-people exchange, with many Sri Lankans and people of Sri Lankan heritage living and working in Switzerland, and many Swiss tourists visiting Sri Lanka. We also appreciate the cultural exchange programmes conducted by the Swiss Embassy in Colombo such as showcasing Swiss Artists at the Fairway Galle Literary Festival and the contemporary Art Exhibition Colomboscope in cooperation with Pro Helvetia New Delhi. The organisation of film festivals in Sri Lanka, such as the European Film Festival, the Francophone Film Festival, Cinema on the Road, the Jaffna International Cinema Festival and the Colombo International Women’s Film Festival have expanded our outreach in cultural cooperation. Sri Lanka and Switzerland face common challenges in the 21st Century, such as Climate Change, Terrorism, and Food and Energy Security. The strong and steadily advancing partnership between our two countries gives us confidence in tackling these challenges together. We look forward to working with our Swiss friends to promote Sri Lanka-Switzerland bilateral ties to even greater heights. “I would be remiss in my duties today if I don’t say a few words about Ambassador Furgler who is about to conclude his tour of duty in Sri Lanka. “Ambassador Furgler, your services in Sri Lanka in the past three years is much appreciated not only because of your professionalism and Cordiality but also for the significant contributions made to broaden the vistas of our cooperation. We all enjoyed your hospitality and the kind relations that you and your wife Hayam established with Sri Lanka. We will miss you both. Thank you again and wishing you both the best for all your engagements and a wonderful retirement”."

With a nearly 40% drop in paddy production in 2022, Sri Lanka’s rice ecosystem is vulnerable and requires immediate attention. To combat this issue, FAO has initiated an innovative project titled RiceUP, with funding of €4 million from the European Union (EU). As part of this project, FAO and its partners are conducting training programmes for Agriculture Extension Officers (AEOs) on Integrated Plant Nutrient Management (IPNM) in four districts: Ampara, Badulla, Hambantota, and Polonnaruwa. The training will equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to guide paddy farmers on soil management and the optimal use of organic and chemical fertilisers to enhance crop yield, while reducing chemical dependency. The initial training session for Agriculture Extension Officers (AEOs) on IPNM practices was launched yesterday at the Rice Research and Development Institute in Batalagoda. This session marks the beginning of a series of five training programmes, aiming to train a total of 300 AEOs from the selected districts. The Training Manual developed collaboratively with international and national consultants, the Department of Agriculture, MASL, and the University of Peradeniya will serve as the cornerstone of these training sessions. IPNM is a sustainable land management practice that ensures soil quality, prevents degradation, and maximises crop productivity, while safeguarding the environment. FAO’s induction of IPNM, coupled with the provision of urea fertiliser to smallholder farmers in selected districts, is a response to the challenges faced by farmers in accessing essential fertilisers and maintaining food security. By adopting IPNM and accessing urea fertiliser, smallholder paddy farmers can reduce costs and improve productivity, leading to better profitability and resilience to future shocks. Through the implementation of sustainable farming practices, including the safe and efficient use of fertiliser and quality seed, RiceUP aims to enhance productivity, food security, and livelihoods in Sri Lanka’s paddy farming sector. Together with its partners, FAO remains dedicated to ensuring the long-term sustainability and resilience of Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector."

Free Media plays an important role in maintaining checks and balances, which is an important requirement in a democratic society. In this respect, the role of a robust and independent media cannot be overstated.” The letter stated that SLBG believes this alleged ban sets a dangerous precedent. Barring critical voices is not conducive to a healthy dialogue and indirectly stifles the freedom of the media, it added. “We believe in the mutual respect and cooperation between the Sri Lanka Cricket and the media, as we both play vital roles in the development and promotion of cricket in our beloved nation. Let us continue this relationship with openness and mutual understanding,” the SLGB said."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He expressed these views during a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (20). Amunugama further said it is necessary to update and modify Sri Lanka’s existing legislative framework in order to make the country an investment-friendly destination. It is expected to introduce new investment laws by the end of 2023, without affecting other government entities and current legal frameworks. “Additionally, foreign investors do not receive their investment rights when they enter this country. As a solution, we must update our legislative framework to ensure that their investment rights are protected. A seven-member committee comprising Directors General of government institutions has already been appointed to look into the existing laws that restrict investments,” he said. He said,  “The government intends to execute a programme under the concept of ‘One Village – One Product’ to empower entrepreneurs who produce export-level products in selected regional secretariats, involving them in the export process, and scale it up at the District and National levels. A Central Export Centre will be established for them and measures will be taken to strengthen the connection between the rural exporters and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board.”"

For example, he said, only 14% of Grade Three students have acquired minimum competency in literacy and only 15% in numeracy.” These harrowing circumstances for the country and its people demand deep reforms to stabilise the economy and bold action to protect the poor and vulnerable. “Many more people are just one shock away from poverty and the World Bank has estimated that 5.7 per cent of the population lives less than 10% above the poverty line, and a further 5.6 per cent between 10 and 20 per cent above the poverty line due to Sri Lanka’s worst economic crisis in decades,” he underscored. There have been some signs of stability in the past few months compared to 2022 he added.  Inflation is trending downwards from 69.8% in September 2022 to 12% in June 2023, he stressed. Further, Market interest rates are also declining as the uncertainty over domestic debt restructuring wanes and the foreign exchange liquidity picture has also improved but yet, this is not the end of the road. The path to recovery is long and Sri Lanka must stay the course. He also said that the people of Sri Lanka have demonstrated incredible resilience in the face of these extraordinary challenges he pointed out adding that was demonstrated during acute shortages of necessities last year of food, medicines, and cooking gas. People supported each other and found innovative solutions to overcome difficulties. He also said in just one year, Sri Lanka has made good progress in addressing severe challenges facing the economy and the country is now in an economic recovery phase. Some difficult reforms have been implemented and economic recovery has started. Congratulating the Government on securing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Fund Facility, the parliamentary approval of the Domestic Debt Restructuring, and securing international financial support from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, he added that the government has committed to an ambitious reform agenda and implemented some difficult and necessary reforms, including tax reforms, cost-reflective utility pricing, a stronger social safety net, and debt restructuring to stabilise the economy. The key downside risk is a prolonged debt restructuring process, which would lead to greater uncertainty. Slow or uneven implementation of the reform agenda could further delay the recovery process and the return of confidence in the Sri Lankan economy. Hadad-Zervos expressed concerns about the scarring effects of Sri Lanka’s severe economic crisis on growth, income, and jobs. He warned that the problem could lead to a higher emigration rate among high-skilled individuals and result in families withdrawing children from school. Also, struggling companies might sell vital assets, reducing the country’s capacity to grow and generate jobs and income. To prevent the vulnerable from slipping deeper into poverty, social protection reforms need careful implementation. The World Bank is committed to supporting the government in its reform path, offering USD 700 million in financing support through the RESET DPO and the Social Protection project. The Country Partnership Framework (CPF) outlines a two-phased approach. In the initial 18-24 months, the focus will be on urgent macro-fiscal and structural reforms, protecting human capital, and supporting vulnerable populations. After this, with successful reform implementation and international financial support, the focus will shift to investments in longer-term development needs, promoting private sector job creation and building resilience to climate and external shocks. The WB official suggested five essential actions for Sri Lanka’s recovery, including shifting to a more productive and outward-looking economy by unlocking untapped export potential and attracting better investments. He also emphasized the need to transform economic governance, address competitiveness constraints, and improve the governance of State Owned Enterprises. Strengthening the social protection system, prioritizing investments in human capital, and enhancing access and quality of Tertiary and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) for skills development were also deemed critical for sustainable development and growth.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He said the trade union action which they had decided on had been temporarily shelved last week owing to the agreement which had been reached with the DGHS in the presence of the Deputy Director of National Hospital Colombo. Kumudesh said the chief demand had been the removal of the incumbent department head to appoint another Consultant Specialist to the post. However, it has been noted that the incumbent head, who is a Consultant Microbiologist was accused of holding onto the position by force for a lengthy period.   The protest which was staged in front of the office of the DDG-NHSL dispersed after he (the DDG-NHSL) agreed to discuss the implementation of the agreement that had been reached with the DGHS at noon today (20).

President of the MCPA, Dr. Chamal Sanjeeva, lambasting Minister Rambukwella yesterday (19), said his comments were an insult to all politicians in the country. According to the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO), the responsibility of a country’s health system was to save every human life that could be saved. “Even during the most dangerous pandemic, great politicians in other countries declared that they would dedicate themselves to saving every human life they could save. They did not make such comments regarding the number of patients that died,” he said. It was announced in Parliament that the Health Ministry had spent half of its allocations from the 2023 Budget on emergency purchases of pharmaceuticals. The MCPA President noted that he had continuously pointed out during the past few months that high costs were incurred through emergency purchases of medicinal drugs. “It is clear now that the island’s Health Ministry is bankrupt as a result of spending such large amounts of money on emergency purchases,” he added. Dr. Sanjeeva lamented that the silent policy that was being observed by the President in view of the audit reports on the Health Ministry’s questionable corrupt expenditures on buying large quantities of antibiotics, surgical equipment, inhalers and insulin paying several times more than the stipulated price was unbelievable. The MCPA President warned that he would discuss with legal organisations what course of action needed to be taken against the human and economic killings that were taking place under the incumbent Health Minister and his officials. Further, he said all civil organisations would be rallied to create awareness amongst the national and international institutions, embassies and high commissions about the collapse of the State health system.

This highly anticipated event took place on 12 and 13 May 2023 at the elegant Balmoral, Kingsbury Hotel. Under the Presidency of Prof. Mandika Wijeyaratne, Professor of Surgery, University of Colombo, the Conference surpassed all expectations by providing a platform for esteemed scholars from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan and Sri Lanka to exchange ideas, showcase their work, and foster collaborations in the field of vascular surgery. With the theme ‘Regaining Blood Flow’ – A SAARC Destination, the Conference not only pushed the boundaries of academic discourse and furthered the pursuit of knowledge in vascular surgery, but also built bonds between the vascular societies of the SAARC region. SLSVS_23 was a landmark occasion for many reasons. On one aspect the meeting was building friendships and fostering collaboration regionally and on the other, it was an event to honour and tribute to the greats of vascular surgery in Sri Lanka. The speciality of vascular surgery in Sri Lanka is growing from strength to strength, both in numbers and through its impact on the country and its healthcare service. The highlight of the Conference was the Inauguration Ceremony, graced by Chief Guest, Prof.  M. D. Lamawansa, Vice Chancellor, University of Peradeniya and current President, SAARC Surgical Care Society as well as the Guest of Honour, Dr Narendra Pinto, Past President, SAARC Surgical Care Society. In the words of Isaac Newton, “If we have seen further, it is only by sitting on the shoulders of giants”. The Inauguration Ceremony saw two such giants in Vascular Surgery being recognised for their outstanding contribution to the field of Vascular Surgery; Prof. Channa Ratnatunga, Emeritus Professor, University of Peradeniya and Prof. A.H. Sheriffdeen, Emeritus Professor, University of Colombo were awarded Lifetime Achievement Awards. The climax of the evening was the Inaugural A.H. Sheriffdeen Oration. Prof. Mandika Wijeyaratne, Professor of Surgery, Colombo and President of the Sri Lankan Society for Vascular Surgery, delivered the prestigious inaugural A. H. Sheriffdeen Oration, paying tribute to Prof. Sheriffdeen’s groundbreaking contributions and highlighting his impact on the development of vascular surgery in Sri Lanka over the years. Having been his protégé for over 30 years (and continuing), the oration served as a celebration of Prof. Sheriffdeen’s remarkable life, tireless efforts, and exemplary work ethic in advancing the field to what it is known for in the country today. Vascular surgery is a subspecialty of surgery that deals with blood vessels in the human body. The arteries transport the blood from the heart to the rest of the body and the veins bring back the distributed blood back to the heart. With Sri Lanka compounded by an ever-ageing population, an epidemic of diabetes mellitus, and an increase in tobacco use vascular diseases such as diabetic foot disease, critical leg ischemia leading to major lower limb amputation, stroke, aneurysms and varicose veins related issues are exponentially rising. ‘SLSVS_23’ – the meeting, led by Congress Chair Dr. Thushan Gooneratne, Consultant Vascular Surgeon, NHSL, was conducted over two days, focused on these issues and was a tremendous success. 25 foreign delegates took part in the meeting as resource persons from 8 different countries with 20 of them taking part in person. Together with fellow vascular surgeons of Sri Lanka, the start-studded list of renowned experts from the local and international faculty, shared their valuable knowledge and research findings, highlighting cutting-edge advancements in deep venous disease, aortic surgery, superficial venous disease, vascular trauma, vascular access, acute limb ischemia, and chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Their presence provided a global perspective and allowed enriched discussions much to the awe of the eager audience. Initially limited to only 60 participants, Registration had to be extended to over 100 participants owing to popular demand. The meeting saw them thoroughly engaging with fellow academics, exchanging ideas, and discussing the latest advancements in the field. An exceptional pre-congress workshop on endovenous laser ablation, a cutting-edge technique in the treatment of venous disease, was facilitated by Dr. Ravul Jindal (Bangalore, India), the President-Elect of the World Union of Phlebology, an esteemed expert in the field. This hands-on experience offered participants the opportunity to learn and refine their skills in this innovative procedure. Consultants and trainees who attended the workshop expressed their immense satisfaction with the hands-on skills and practical knowledge gained from the experience. History was created at SLSVS_23. The Conference marked the establishment of the first-ever, SAARC Society for Vascular Surgery, a momentous occasion that created an international platform for vascular surgeons across South Asia to collaborate, share knowledge, and advance the field. This Conference served as the inaugural event for the society, with the election of Prof. Mandika Wijeyaratne as the Inaugural President and Prof. Rezni Cassim as the Inaugural Secretary, setting the stage for future growth and achievements in the field of vascular surgery in Sri Lanka. In addition to the academic sessions, the conference hall showcased the latest advancements in vascular surgery through the participation of pharmaceutical and medical device companies. These exhibitors presented cutting-edge technologies, innovative devices and products, providing a conducive environment for networking and forging collaborations, with many participants expressing enthusiasm about potential joint ventures and research partnerships. As the Conference drew to a close, Country Awards were presented to Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan in appreciation of their significant contributions to the Conference as well as towards the formation of the SAARC Society for Vascular Surgery. With a tremendous sense of success, the Conference came to an end, leaving a lasting impact on attendees. The gathering of remarkable minds in vascular surgery of the entire SAARC region under one roof, for the first time in history, united by the vision of promoting research, collaboration, and a yearning for future advancements, proved to be a truly inspiring weekend. Through its diverse range of topics, engaging sessions, and immersive cultural experiences, the SLSVS_23 fostered new connections, inspired innovative ideas, and contributed to the future of vascular surgery in the region and beyond. Prof. Mandika Wijeyaratne said at the inauguration “As a region, it is clear that we have our own intricacies and it’s an opportunity to look beyond simply our institution, or country and think regional.  To take upon issues that are common to all of us and to share resources in finding common solutions. Knowledge and resources can be shared; research in collaboration is the way forward”. Quite fittingly the theme of SLSVS_23 – “Regaining blood flow – A SAARC Destination” resonated with it.

They also demanded to fast-track process to provide every affected family member with copies of key documents related to the incidents or losses they have experienced which includes copies of police reports, records from various public commissions, and complaint records submitted to the Human Rights Commission (HRC), among others. They said in cases where the original police complaint cannot be located in the police records, they propose recording new complaints linked to the original ones under this accelerated process. They also demanded, in the absence or death of the family members who originally had made complaints, recognise the right of the next of kin in that family who is continuing the struggle for truth and justice to claim these documents. The documents issued under the fast-track process must be guaranteed to have the same credibility for legal and administrative purposes as a police report made at the time of the event. He also noted that as the follow-up on the already-established findings related to a number of emblematic cases in Batticaloa, which were presented to Presidential Commissions on numerous occasions with clear and credible evidence, including eyewitness accounts. Thorough inquires and investigations must be conducted within one year, and results of these must be made public.  They also recalled that many families have already identified to numerous commissions which camps their loved ones were taken. A list of those who are responsible mast be published. This way, families can make specific demands with regards to the whereabouts of their loved ones, and for overall accountability for enforced disappearance. Also brought to light was that credible inquiries must be initiated into the role and culpability of all armed groups in abductions and enforced disappearances, including by groups such as PLOTE, EPDP, Karuna Faction and TMVP that worked alongside the government forces.  Meanwhile, multiple civil society groups have written to the Government and even submitted a copy of the letter of concern to Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, expressing the victim community’s lack of confidence in any local commission or tribunal, including the recent National Unity and Reconciliation Commission (NURC). These commissions have a history of obstructing truth-seeking and preventing the victims from attaining accountability. The groups have also highlighted that prominent officials and politicians consistently affirm their commitment to supporting war heroes and patriotic forces. The civil society said if the Government is interested in winning the public’s trust it should review the existing recommendations from previous commissions and develop a plan to implement them with a time frame. Another group has also written to the Government stating that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission by the Government should with the support of the International Community urged to fast-track a process of giving every affected family member copies of the key documents that relate to the incidents or losses they have experienced.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

They also demanded to fast-track process to provide every affected family member with copies of key documents related to the incidents or losses they have experienced which includes copies of police reports, records from various public commissions, and complaint records submitted to the Human Rights Commission (HRC), among others. They said in cases where the original police complaint cannot be located in the police records, they propose recording new complaints linked to the original ones under this accelerated process. They also demanded, in the absence or death of the family members who originally had made complaints, recognise the right of the next of kin in that family who is continuing the struggle for truth and justice to claim these documents. The documents issued under the fast-track process must be guaranteed to have the same credibility for legal and administrative purposes as a police report made at the time of the event. He also noted that as the follow-up on the already-established findings related to a number of emblematic cases in Batticaloa, which were presented to Presidential Commissions on numerous occasions with clear and credible evidence, including eyewitness accounts. Thorough inquires and investigations must be conducted within one year, and results of these must be made public.  They also recalled that many families have already identified to numerous commissions which camps their loved ones were taken. A list of those who are responsible mast be published. This way, families can make specific demands with regards to the whereabouts of their loved ones, and for overall accountability for enforced disappearance. Also brought to light was that credible inquiries must be initiated into the role and culpability of all armed groups in abductions and enforced disappearances, including by groups such as PLOTE, EPDP, Karuna Faction and TMVP that worked alongside the government forces.  Meanwhile, multiple civil society groups have written to the Government and even submitted a copy of the letter of concern to Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, expressing the victim community’s lack of confidence in any local commission or tribunal, including the recent National Unity and Reconciliation Commission (NURC). These commissions have a history of obstructing truth-seeking and preventing the victims from attaining accountability. The groups have also highlighted that prominent officials and politicians consistently affirm their commitment to supporting war heroes and patriotic forces. The civil society said if the Government is interested in winning the public’s trust it should review the existing recommendations from previous commissions and develop a plan to implement them with a time frame. Another group has also written to the Government stating that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission by the Government should with the support of the International Community urged to fast-track a process of giving every affected family member copies of the key documents that relate to the incidents or losses they have experienced.

One of the demands was transferring  three medical officers serving under the specialist doctor in ward 8B to another ward.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/07/19/kks-karaikkal-ferry-service-on-hold-indefinitely/,KKS- Karaikkal ferry service on hold indefinitely,Author not found,0,2023-07-19T02:35:00+00:00," The Kankesanturai-Karaikkal (KKS-KKL) ferry services have been put on hold indefinitely and the ferry service from KKS is now diverted to the Port of Nagapattinam, a natural port located on the shores of the Bay of Bengal in Tamil Nadu, India, mainly due to absence of a comprehensive policy framework outlining safety measures and clear standards for the ferry service, including provisions for a place of refuge in case of distress. While Sri Lanka has given its approval for the operation of the KKS-KKL ferry, India, which has not operated ferry services for almost 40 years, needs to update its policies regarding quality passenger services, especially safety measures. The operator of the ferry service, Managing Director of IndSri Ferry Services Pvt Ltd, S. Niranjan Nandagopan, emphasised the importance of framing policies to ensure the safety and quality of the passenger service has come to light and as he was proceeding with obtaining approval from Indian officials he found more bottlenecks in getting clearances and approvals. Nandagopan, who is the cleared operator for IndSri, has already rented a passenger ship from Singapore, where he is domiciled. He pays a monthly rent of USD 50,000 for the ship, and he aims to commence the service between Nagapattinam and KKS by July 2023 failing which by the end of this year or January 2024. The policy framework is expected to be finalised soon, and Nandagopan told Ceylon Today that he is eagerly waiting for it to be in place. “One of the essential aspects that need to be included in the policy is a clause about a place of refuge, specifying the action to be taken if the ferry encounters distress at sea. Both the coastal guards of India and the Sri Lanka Navy need to agree on the responsibility of providing assistance in their respective waters. These measures came to light during the approval-seeking process,” he added. The governments of India and Sri Lanka announced the commencement of ferry services, targeted for the first week of July or no later than August 2023. The Union Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways of the Puducherry Port Department was also involved in the plans to launch a ferry service between KKL and KKS. However, the formulation of policies in several areas has delayed the process. Decisions about the ferry service, such as passenger capacity, vessel class, and craft speed, need to be carefully drafted within the policy framework. Nandagopan added that seeking permission and clearance faced several bottlenecks, and different parties involved in India had difficulties in approving the service due to uncertainties about roles and responsibilities. Now, the focus is on drafting a comprehensive policy framework that will enable the smooth operation of the ferry service. Further, Karaikkal Port, operated by Adani Group, primarily focuses on coal transport and industrial purposes. Due to concerns about passenger safety while leaving KKL, using that port has come to a halt. Finally, India has agreed to commence the ferry service between Nagapattinam Port and KKS, located in the North of Sri Lanka. Nagapattinam Port is about 25 km from KKL, situated in Tamil Nadu, while KKL is part of the Union Territory of Puducherry. Karaikkal Port Private Limited (KPPL) is a deep-water port developed on a Build, Operate, and Transfer format under Public-Private Partnership, awarded by the Government of Puducherry. Since its operations began, the port has handled various cargo, including coal, sugar, cement, fertilisers, project cargo, agro commodities, liquid cargo, and containers and to have a passenger service it was questionable, added Nandagopan. Meanwhile, the Indian High Commission to Colombo, on 17 July, noted that an India-Sri Lanka Joint Committee appointed under MoU on Passenger Transportation by Sea held a virtual meeting on 14 July where Rajesh Kumar Sinha, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways of the Government of India and K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, Secretary, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation of the Government of Sri Lanka held discussions. The discussions focused on the resumption of ferry services between the two countries connecting mutually agreed points. Both sides agreed that the resumption of ferry services will boost regional trade and tourism and promote stronger people-to-people ties. The Joint Committee identified several areas for mutual cooperation for operationalisation of ferry services in the near future, and desired to take further steps based on mutual understanding. The Joint Committee was recently reconstituted by the Governments of India and Sri Lanka as per the provisions of the bilateral Memorandum of Understanding on Passenger Transportation by Sea, signed in 2011.

Accordingly, signatures for the NCM will be collected today (19). During a heated verbal exchange with Rambukwella, Premadasa announced that the Opposition will present the NCM against him in Parliament promptly. Premadasa alleged a severe shortage of medicines and medical supplies in Sri Lanka. He claimed that several deaths had been reported recently due to administering substandard medication at various hospitals. “People admitted for minor illnesses have died because they were given substandard medication. We urge the authorities to investigate these incidents and prevent further similar occurrences,” he said. Premadasa also called on the authorities to immediately withdraw the questionable medications and take strong action against those responsible for procuring them. He further questioned why Rambukwella remained silent despite repeated incidents of deaths caused by administering substandard medication. The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) previously announced that an NCM would be moved against Minister Rambukwella due to the sudden deaths occurring in the country and the alleged importation of substandard medicine. Later, it was confirmed that the proposal was unanimously approved by all SJB MPs during its Parliamentary group meeting held on 17 July evening. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

The committee was appointed by the former Justice Minister to address the inadequacies of the present Prisons Ordinance, which governs the prison system in Sri Lanka. The need for a new Bill arises from the recognition that the existing provisions of the Prisons Ordinance do not meet the present requirements and fail to comply with the international legal obligations and standards that Sri Lanka is obligated to uphold. In response, the Law Reforms Committee drafted a preliminary Bill proposing amendments to the existing Ordinance. Consequently, the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs, and Constitutional Reforms presented a proposal to Cabinet, seeking approval to direct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a new Prison Administration Bill based on the preliminary Bill.

MCPA President Chamal Sanjeewa, staging a Satyagraha (sit-down protest) outside the Health Ministry amidst heavy security provided to the Ministry premises, demanded that the Minister step down from his post failing which the civil organisations threatened to storm its premises. Accusing Rambukwella of seriously jeopardising the free health service in the island by bringing substandard drugs and giving unregistered drugs to patients, Sanjeewa warned that his outfit would rally all professional and civil organisations by next week and breach the walls of the Ministry if the Minister did not step down. “Former Minister of Health Channa Jayasumana ignored my warnings last year regarding mounting public dissatisfaction against former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa which resulted in the public uprising against him,” the MCPA President said.  “In the same way, even though the present Minister of Health is working for the survival of the free health service the poor administration and management of his officials who cannot even act according to the instructions, would lead to growing discomfort amongst people. If there is a conspiracy against the Government, as Minister Rambukwella himself says, he should consider himself responsible for it,” Dr. Sanjeewa said. He urged the President to pay heed to the warning and focus on solving the problem without distancing himself from the people. Convener of the National Movement Against Bribery and Corruption (NMBC), Jamuni Kamantha, lamented that the public had lost faith in the free health service. “Minister Rambukwella has been unable to resolve the crisis in the State health service while patients seeking treatment from the free health service have only lost their lives during his tenure as the Health Minister,” he said.  Civil Rights activist Ajantha Perera demanded the Minister quit his post as even the lives of infants and children’s lives were at stake owing to a decision taken by the Health Minister, Health Secretary and Director General of Health Services (DGHS) to use unregistered drugs. “The Minister does not have a moral right to occupy the post and the damage he has done to the health system should be compensated immediately and punished accordingly,” she said. Civil Aociety activist, Asela Sampath, urged people to rally together to take legal action against the Health Minister, the Health Secretary and the DGHS for the present crisis. He warned that simultaneous protests would be held outside the US Embassy, the World Health Organization (WHO) Office in Colombo, UNICEF and the Indian High Commission if the Minister failed to understand the message given through the Satyagraha and acted arbitrarily. Religious leaders, lawyers, trade unions and civil organisations participated in the sit-down protest.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

He said this during yesterday’s parliamentary sittings in response to MP Wimal Weerawansa’s query as to how the tree was removed so quickly. Weerawansa raised a question regarding the quick removal of the ‘Sri Lanka Legume’ tree (Crudia zeylanica), which had obstructed the construction of the Central Expressway in Daraluwa, Veyangoda. Curious about the quick disappearance of the tree, Weerawansa directly asked the minister, “Minister, can you explain how you made the tree vanish so soon?” Gunawardana replied, “It is due to the efficiency of the State officials who carried out the Cabinet decision shortly after it was made.” By Methmalie Dissanayake"

These losses have hindered the Board’s ability to cover operational expenses, service debts, and maintain the quality of water supply services, according to the Minister. Thondaman expressed these views during a media briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (18). He said the water tariff increase was a necessary step taken to address the critical challenges faced by the NWSDB and ensure clean drinking water for all Sri Lankans. “The increase was driven by several factors, including the surge in electricity tariffs, which significantly contribute to the cost of water production. Additionally, the burden of debt resulting from past capital expenditure to expand water infrastructure, combined with currency depreciation and interest rate hikes, as well as the exponential increase in the cost of raw materials required for water treatment, have added to the financial strain on the NWSDB,” he explained. Thondaman also confirmed that the NWSDB is committed to reviewing the water tariffs in the coming months and implementing a new tariff formula and policy in line with the Government’s commitments to its development partners. “I will take all necessary steps to reduce tariffs in the next revision while ensuring the financial viability of the NWSDB. We are actively exploring cost-saving measures within the NWSDB, such as reducing excess staff and adopting advanced technologies to optimise efficiency and streamline operations. Our goal is to provide efficient and effective water services to everyone while considering the economic challenges faced by our people,” he added. He revealed that there are over 12,000 employees under the NWSDB, with 75 per cent of them being unskilled workers.

Secretary of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Haritha Aluthge yesterday (18) said only emergency treatment would be provided at the OPD while all other routine OPD services would not be carried out. He said, “The solution to this issue is in the hands of the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) and we are ready to call off the strike even at the last minute.” However, while the DGHS has promised to resolve the issue even he seems to be intimidated by the Administration of LRH, Dr. Aluthge alleged. Accusing the specialist in Ward 8B of LRH of acting arbitrarily, harassment of ward staff and MBBS doctors serving in the ward, he said complaints to the Hospital’s Director and the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) were of no avail. They were not interested in resolving the issue and were only making empty pledges.  This is not the first time that such complaints have been made against the particular specialist. Dr. Aluthge alleged that such behaviour had been witnessed when the said specialist had served in areas like Karawanella, Avissawella, Negombo, and even when she worked at the LRH previously. “Her actions are such that even medical students do not go to her ward to train under her. Even the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) has stopped sending postgraduate trainees to her ward.” “But for the past two years the GMOA has been requesting a settlement to this issue,” while the DGHS has been making promise after promise, he lamented. He accused the LRH Director of even attempting to create a wrong impression by using a particular media organisation and a particular newspaper. He warned that the Hospital Administration should take the total blame for the strike. “He has failed to carry out the instructions of even the DGHS while the DGHS himself seems to be unable to act on his promise to resolve the matter,” the GMOA Secretary charged.

Speaking in Parliament, Rambukwella said not all patients admitted to hospitals make it out alive and that is why funeral parlours are located near hospitals. Rambukwella, in response to a query made by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, said the drug believed to be responsible for the recent death of a young woman at Peradeniya Teaching Hospital is still being used in hospitals islandwide. There are presently over 66,000 vials of this drug in stock nationwide, according to the Minister. The Minister informed Parliament that a total of 145,930 vials of the drug had been distributed to hospitals, with 79,260 vials already utilised. He provided specific figures for certain hospitals, stating that 19,200 vials were sent to Batticaloa Hospital, of which 16,800 had been used, and 12,800 out of 24,000 vials provided to Peradeniya Teaching Hospital had been used. Additionally, 1,800 vials out of 2,400 supplied to Avissawella Hospital and all 50 vials provided to Moratuwa Hospital had been used. The Minister clarified that this particular drug had been registered in Sri Lanka since 2013 and has been in use for 20 years. He also emphasised that the drug was imported by a reputable international company.

This event was aimed at identifying gaps and needs related to addressing climate-induced L&D in Sri Lanka while building on existing policy processes and programmes of action focused on climate-induced L&D as well as risk management, finance, and transfer to better contribute to national and global processes on addressing needs related to climate-induced L&D. Discussing the importance of identifying key gaps and needs to better address L&D in Sri Lanka, Dr. Anil Jasinghe said the necessity of addressing the issues connected to disaster risk management across the full spectrum rather than addressing standalone concerns, “As a country that is one of the worst affected by climate change, we need to act on climate justice and conduct disaster risk management across the full spectrum rather than focusing only on L&D as a standalone because then we would be limiting ourselves”. He commented that there was a gestation period involved for the work related to L&D, however, we will go ahead with the upcoming 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)-COP28 in November/December 2023 as it presents an important opportunity to engage in this process in line with Sri Lanka’s climate policies and the tripartite alliance for Sri Lanka’s participation in COP28. Addressing the gathering, Minister of Environment Naseer Ahamed commented on the importance of key stakeholders working together to achieve favourable outcomes related to climate action: “To effectively mitigate the L&D induced by climate change, the research and development aspect is important. To achieve long-term climate resilience,  it is important for Sri Lanka to engage in multi-actor partnerships to guide the way forward. This approach will enable the country to achieve sustainable development.” He said, this was particularly relevant in connection to global processes and climate negotiations under the UNFCCC, such as those related to the Loss and Damage Fund and the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage. Vositha Wijenayake – Executive Director of SLYCAN Trust – mentioned that L&D has become a key focus of climate discussions in the present day. She said, “Although many countries have been highlighting the importance of accounting for L&D induced by climate change since the climate conventions of 1992, the topic had not been seriously considered until recently.” She remarked on five focus areas related to L&D that had been developed in rollout plans since 2013, namely: slow onset events such as sea level and temperature increases, economic losses such as the destruction of our nature reserves, non-economic losses such as the erosion of our culture and heritage, comprehensive risk management and human mobility. Director of Climate Change Secretariat at the Ministry of Environment, Leel Randeni, closed the proceedings by highlighting that this workshop is the first event conducted on L&D under climate action in Sri Lanka and that mechanisms have been developed during the talks. He highlighted that the key elements of the workshop were the active participation of the key stakeholders gathered by filling out the questionnaires and templates and engaging in dialogue with each other.              SLYCAN Trust is an internationally recognised non-profit think tank working on climate change, sustainable development, ecosystem conservation, animal welfare, and social justice. Our work spans the national, regional, and global levels from policy analysis and evidence-based research to on-the-ground implementation."

The Gampaha Wildlife Conservation Office had previously informed the Court that the rare tree type had been illegally removed from its location. Counsel Lakdinu Weerasekera, appearing on the instructions of Ven. Udasgiriye Samitha Thera, urged the Court to take up the case yesterday. He said the tree in question had been listed in the Red Data Book as a species threatened with extinction globally. The Counsel said a Cabinet Minister had claimed that the removal of the tree in question had been made collectively by Cabinet. He added that the Gampaha Wildlife Conservation Officer, submitting a B Report to Court, had insisted that a probe had been launched by them already to identify those behind the uprooting of the tree. The Counsel, therefore, requested the Court to issue an order to arrest the suspects behind the removal of the tree as well as seize machines and equipment used for its uprooting as the incident is tantamount to a crime. Considering the submissions, the Court ordered the Duty Officer of the Gampaha Wildlife Conservation Office to produce submissions in this regard on the aforementioned date.

Speaking at a media briefing on 16 July, JJB MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya criticised the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment for introducing labour law reforms that she believes cater solely to the expectations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, neglecting the needs of the working class in the country. Amarasuriya argued that the new labour law reforms were drafted based on the illusionary concept of a “free economic individual” capable of directly negotiating with employers. She contended that those responsible for drafting these laws were operating under a neo-liberal illusion, mistakenly assuming the existence of free economic individuals in Sri Lanka akin to Western countries. According to Amarasuriya, the negative consequences of the new laws have been camouflaged by appealing terms such as “gender equality.” She suggested that the dangers associated with the implementation of this legal framework are concealed behind these decorative words borrowed from Western concepts. She further claimed that a selective choice of words has been employed to deceive the public. While acknowledging that the IMF and the World Bank have emphasised the importance of promoting female participation in the workforce due to Sri Lanka’s relatively lower female workforce compared to other countries, she criticised the approach taken to address this issue. Amarasuriya contended that these new labour laws serve as a tool for the Government to curtail people’s rights and appease external parties, particularly employers, thereby undermining the interests of employees.

Basin Reserve in Wellington and Christchurch’s Hagley Oval will host the two games in February and March. New Zealand’s men’s team also welcome South Africa in the same month for two Tests – to be held at Bay Oval in Tauranga and Seddon Park in Hamilton. This will be New Zealand’s latest attempt to break their duck against a side who they have never beaten in the format at home or away. The men’s team’s home summer kicks off on 17 December with the ODI and T20I series against Bangladesh, which is then followed by five T20Is against Pakistan between 12 and 21 January, further ramping up their preparation for the T20 World Cup. While the Bangladesh fixtures will be played across four venues – Dunedin, Nelson, Napier and Tauranga – the Pakistan fixtures will be held in Auckland, Hamilton, Dunedin and Christchurch. New Zealand’s home summer consists of 32 international fixtures, starting off with Sophie Devine’s side taking on Pakistan in the first of the three T20Is in Dunedin on 3 December. This will be followed by as many ODIs until 18 December, that will be part of the ICC Women’s Championship. They will however not play another home game until 19 March, when they host England for five T20Is and three ODIs – in Dunedin, Nelson, Wellington and Hamilton. “It’s a hugely exciting time for cricket in New Zealand, both in terms of the great series and teams on offer this summer, and the ability for fans to either attend the matches first-hand or watch live on TV at no charge,” NZC Chief Executive David White said. While devising their schedule, New Zealand Cricket also decided to have no fewer than 10 double-headers – addressing the dual need of luring different audiences as well as enhancing the efficiency of the schedule in times of climate change awareness. “In terms of venues with lights, we’ve been able to schedule several back-to-back night matches and day matches to ensure good opportunities for both families and adult patrons, respectively, which we think is good for the game. It’s a strategy that also complements our need to prioritise energy efficiency – and to just do the right thing as a sports organisation, given the challenges we’re facing from climate change these days,” White said.  (Cricbuzz)"

Addressing a media briefing, Gammanpila said, “It is true that several other plants of Crudia Zeylanica are in the country at the moment. However, the manner that was followed to chop the tree was totally unacceptable. Now the Government tries to justify this horrific act by claiming that 200 saplings would be planted. But this act can never be justified.” Gammanpila said the Cabinet cannot violate the country’s law in this manner. Removing this Crudia zeylanica plant was a violation of the Section 43 of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, under which the plant is deemed a protected species.

He called for increased awareness among the public about this matter. He said, during the previous census, there were issues with misidentification, where many Indian origin Tamils were mistakenly counted as Sri Lankan Tamils. As a result, the number of hill country Tamils was inaccurately reduced to approximately 850,000. Thondaman pointed out that some census officials often assume that those living in plantations are Indian Tamils, while those in the cities were Sri Lankan Tamils. He also said some people wrongly identify themselves as Sri Lankan Tamils just based on language. To rectify these errors, he stressed the importance of accurately identifying the Indian origin Tamils during the upcoming census. He urged Tamil youth to take on the responsibility of spreading awareness about this matter among the community. He said the census was not a political matter but rather a crucial initiative for the benefit of the people. He called for a transformation in upcountry politics, discouraging the practice of idolizing politicians and instead focusing on the need for politicians to serve the people faithfully. This change, he asserted, is essential for the betterment of their community. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Minister added that 80% of the nation’s agricultural production is expected to be produced locally by 2025 as part of the President’s strategy to modernise the agricultural industry. The use of contemporary technology in agriculture could improve production of fruits and vegetables intended for export and reduce the amount of food that is imported, Minister Amaraweera added. He was speaking at a media briefing held yesterday(17), at the President’s Media Centre (PMC) Amaraweera  said, “Within a year of taking office, the President promptly fixed farmer issues and tried to get them back to  farming. Without a doubt,   circumstances were dire when President Wickremesinghe assumed office and I took over the Ministry of Agriculture. Farmers protested on the roads demanding fertiliser. Youth belonging to farming families left the farms and moved to other areas. Some young people even left the country. The biggest issue in this case was guiding them back to the farmland. The public had no confidence in the Ministers. Farmers stayed away from meetings in this regard. If they are to return to the fields, they demand to be provided fertiliser. Although 275, 000 hectares were supposed to be cultivated during that Yala season, only 212, 000 hectares were cultivated. At that time, the President negotiated with the Indian Government and arranged to provide 6,500 metric tons of fertiliser under the Indian credit scheme. However, the Indian loan arrangement does not allow for the provision of fertiliser. The fertiliser was imported from Oman. Only after learning that a ship carrying fertiliser was approaching the Port did the farmers venture back to their fields. This allowed for the cultivation of 512,000 hectares. It is now the most cultivated hectares during the Yala season after ten years, he said. Amaraweera said a national policy framework is currently being prepared under the leadership of Professor Gamini Senanayake of the University of Ruhuna and added that this policy framework is expected to be complete by the end of August 2023."

The Chamber recommended that immediate action be taken to ensure and enhance the public procurement of medicines in a transparent manner, following established guidelines and requiring registration with the regulator. They emphasised the crucial role of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority in ensuring the procurement of high-quality medicines, including essential medicines obtained through emergency processes. The chamber called for a stronger, more transparent and independent role for the authority. In addition, the Chamber suggested that the pricing of medicines should adopt a market pricing formula, similar to the approach taken for other commodities such as fuel and gas, which were previously subject to price controls. Implementing a pricing formula, developed by relevant experts, will ensure sustainability in the quality of medicines procured. The Chamber acknowledged the recent directive issued by the President to streamline the procurement system. They, along with affiliated associations and professional bodies such as the Sri Lanka Medical Association, are ready to support policymakers in improving and uplifting the current state of the healthcare system, ultimately benefiting the people of the country, the press release said. The Chamber called for prompt and decisive action to address challenges faced in the healthcare procurement sector, emphasising the importance of transparency, quality assurance, and sustainability in providing essential medicines to the public healthcare system."

The clash broke out initially at a hospital, and later continued at the Kalawana Base Hospital, where one person was killed and three others were injured. Kalawana Police reported that a man was stabbed and killed in the hospital’s fourth ward. The incident took place at midnight on Sunday (16). The deceased was identified as Dhamwala Liyanage Ranil Pradip Kumara, a 42-year-old from Delgoda, Kalawana. According to Police investigations, the deceased and his two friends were consuming alcohol. It was during this time that the suspect, accompanied by his father, encountered the group and an altercation ensued. The deceased initiated the attack on the suspect and his father. Another dispute related to the same incident took place near a shop in the Delgoda Colony, where the two groups clashed again while on their way to the Kalawana Base Hospital for medical treatment. During this clash the suspect, his father, and a friend of the deceased sustained injuries. The injured parties arrived at the Kalawana Base Hospital in the 1990 Suwaseriya ambulance service and a private vehicle. However, the situation escalated once again when a group of individuals accompanying the injured parties caused further conflict at the hospital. The suspect’s brother-in-law, who was involved in the murder, was also attacked within the hospital premises. Investigation findings indicate that the suspect, in response to the stabbing of his sister by the deceased, grabbed a knife and pursued the deceased. The deceased sought refuge in the fourth ward of Kalawana Hospital and locked the door, but the suspect forcibly broke in and stabbed the victim. The suspect has fled the area, and Kalawana police are currently conducting investigations to apprehend him. The suspect’s father, sister, and friend have been injured and taken to the hospital, with two of them being admitted to the Ratnapura Teaching Hospital.

The plastic recycling centres, supported under United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Clean Cities Blue Ocean activity will sort, clean, and bale or crush large quantities of plastic in the municipal areas for commercial recycling. The plastic recycling centre is a significant step towards strengthening the role of informal waste collectors through a plastic recycling model developed to increase the recycling rate , said Douglas Sonnek, the Deputy Chief of Mission of the U.S. Embassy in Colombo. “During the US-Sri Lanka 75-year partnership, we have supported such interventions, contributing towards the transformation of discarded plastics into valuable resources, as well as education and researching, and the engagement of local communities in the waste management process”, he said. USAID support provided essential machinery and equipment, including a crusher and baler machine, to the recycling centre among other equipment, such as a scale, trolley, and jumbo collection bags. The workers also received safety equipment such as first aid kits, personal protective equipment, and fire extinguishers. “Collecting and recycling waste is a service to the environment as well as to people to reduce the damage caused by improper waste disposal to the environment. I am very glad that I can contribute to this service with the support of USAID CCBO and Janathakshan”, said Krishantha Vidanagama, Managing Director, Green Step Private Limited. This model piloted in the Kaduwela Municipal area will be replicated in Galle in the coming months to promote sustainable waste management, foster the integration of informal waste collectors into a formal system, and create a cleaner and more environmentally-friendly country. “Investment in recycling gives double dividends. On one hand, it improves the economy of the country by saving the expenditure on plastic material importation while creating employment opportunities for marginalized communities. On the other hand, it reduces the negative impacts on the sensitive ecosystems by diverting the plastic waste which will otherwise be added to the environment for recycling”, said Anil Jasinghe, Secretary of the Ministry of Environment."

The proposal submitted by 14 MPs including MP Sampath Athukorala has been included in the supplements of the Order Book as an indefinite motion. The Motion has been moved under the pretext that the Election Commission consisting of N.G. Punchihewa (Chairman), S.B. Divaratne, M.M. Mohammad, K.P.P. Pathirana and P.S.M. Charles was appointed on 3 December 2020, it is stated in the proposal that the Election Commission is accountable to Parliament as per the provisions of Article 104 B (3) of the Constitution. It also states that according to Article 30 (4) of the 21st Amendment the members of the Commission have completed their tenure and are exercising and performing their powers and functions as interim members. Since the Election Commission has announced that nominations were called for the Local Government Election on 18 January 2023, it has been announced that two members of the Commission have decided to fix this poll on 9 March 2023 and have obtained the consent of the other three members, it is further stated. It is also included in the resolution that the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies has filed an affidavit to the Court stating that it will be challenging to find funds to hold such an election in March 2023. The proposal also states that there is a question as to whether the Commission is satisfied that all the pre-conditions to hold such an election have been met. On 25 January 2023, P.S.M. Charles submitted her resignation letter to the President and the Commission has failed to report to Parliament, which is responsible for public finances, about the problems that have arisen with regard to the Local Government Elections. If the privileges of the MPs and Parliament have been violated, it should be investigated and appropriate recommendations should be made in this regard, the motion further stated. It is learnt that this proposal will be submitted to Parliament on Tuesday (18) and preparations are underway to appoint the Parliamentary Special Committee on the same day. By J.T. de Silva"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa alleged that the Government has resorted to an unprecedented practice of forwarding an electricity bill for the historical procession of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic which is the pinnacle of Buddhist reverence and has, thus, exposed its rude and unscrupulous policy and this vile act is a disgrace to the Dharma of the fully enlightened Lord Buddha, to the entire Buddhist society and the whole country in general. “In particular, I consider this as a serious insult to the global community that pays attention to the historical procession of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic,” he said. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has informed the Nilames of four main devalayas and organisers of the Kandy Esala Perahera to deposit a sum of Rs 13 million to ensure an uninterrupted power supply for the festival. This year’s Kandy Esala Perahera festival will commence on 17 August with the traditional ‘Kap’ planting ceremony at the four Maha Devalayas. The Opposition Leader further said: “I recall that we were immensely shocked by hearing it and express our unconditional disdain to the Government that took this arbitrary decision. It should be remembered at this moment that the Government has allocated money without hesitation especially for activities like the Republic Parade, and we have a strong disgust about the degree of attention paid by the Government to the procession of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, which is famous both locally as well as internationally. The Government had, even previously, targeted several temples issuing them with an unbearable electricity bill and this is something that brings immense displeasure. Rulers should understand that any country has a unique culture and religious value systems and the Government should reveal the root cause of its antagonism against religious and cultural matters. The Government should make it mandatory to resort to subsidised electricity bills for temples and religious shrines and for that, it is possible to get the contribution of the Cultural Fund. We express our strong disdain, unhappiness and protest against putting an unbearable burden on religious shrines without looking for alternatives.” By Gagani Weerakoon"

Further, the Minister said by the end of 2023, the loss of the Postal Department will be reduced byRs 4,000 million. “When President Ranil Wickremesinghe assigned me this Ministry he entrusted me with the challenge of converting the Postal Department into a profit-generating institution. The Postal Service’s income in 2022 wasRs 7,000 million while the expenditure was Rs 14,000 million. I discussed with the relevant officials and took steps to reduce the gap between the income and the expenditure of the Postal Department from Rs 7,000 million to Rs 4,000 million. It is planned to resolve the gap between income and expenditure by 2024. In 2025, our goal is to create a Postal Department that no longer depends on the Treasury,” State Minister Bandara said. “The Postal Department, which is one of the oldest Departments in this country, still has an Ordinance brought during the time of the Queen. It has been amended only once so far. We have identified the Post Office Ordinance as a major obstacle to the modernisation process of the Postal Department and other relevant activities. Therefore, steps are being taken to amend it urgently and 80 per cent of the work has been completed,” the State Minister said. “We hope to create new revenue generation channels through digitisation of the postal service. Presently, Rs 4,000 million, Rs 668 million andRs 200 million has been earned annually by the sale of stamps, postage of stamps and the Cash on Delivery (COD) service, respectively. Also, in the future, it is planned to increase revenue by popularising the COD method.

NPP MP Vijitha Herath, speaking at a media briefing yesterday (16), said the Government has proposed to abolish 13 Acts, through these new laws, that so far have ensured the rights of the working people. Herath also alleged the new labour laws propose to abolish the 8-hour work day and introduce a 12-hour work day instead, and added that it could be extended to 16 hours on the consent of the employee. “The 8-hour work week is a right achieved after a global struggle sacrificing so many lives. Abolishing it is a huge blow to the working people,” he said. The MP said 13 Acts including the Shop and Office Employees Act, Wages Boards Ordinance, etc. have been proposed to be abolished in the new laws and added that these Acts had ensured the rights of working women and the labour force. “The Shop and Office Employees Act ensured the rights of working women, especially when working at night. The employer is bound to provide transport to women if they work after 8:00 p.m. and the consent of the female employee is needed to employ them for night duties,” he said.

The elements of FETÖ (Fethullahist Terrorist Organization) – the group behind the foiled 2016 coup bid – have been eliminated from Sri Lanka after successful joint efforts by the two nations against terrorism. Local intelligence services, based on information provided by Turkiye, alerted relevant authorities of the alleged functioning of FETÖ well ahead of the 2019 Easter Sunday bomb attacks. Addressing the Democracy and National Unity Day Commemoration Ceremony in Colombo on Saturday (15), Ambassador Demet Şekercioğlu said Türkiye continues to engage with the Sri Lankan authorities with enhanced intelligence sharing to build a strong, vigilant and comprehensive response to terrorism. On 15 July 2016, the Government of Türkiye President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan defeated an attempted coup d’état by FETÖ members, which claimed the lives of 251 citizens and left thousands of others injured. The day is commemorated as the Democracy and National Unity Day in Türkiye. The Ambassador said the tragic events that unfolded on 15 July 2016 were not merely acts of terror, but a blatant affront to the founding principles that define the Republic of Türkiye and its people – the principles of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. She said the malicious acts witnessed on 15 July 2016 were not the result of an overnight attempt, but the climax of many years of meticulous planning and covert operations by the FETÖ led by Fethullah Gülen.

Zapmail is the world’s first collaborative email service designed and developed by Sri Lanka to address inefficiencies in team communication by simplifying and streamlining communication, saving teams time and increasing productivity. Commenting on the launch, the Co-Founders of Zapmail; Sean Samarasinghe, Mark Sachintha, Shay Anthony, Devmin Abeyasena and Meredith Ivor say that; “Traditional email services are not designed for team collaboration, resulting in disorganised conversations, difficulty finding relevant information, and time wasted. Thereby, we concentrated on developing a solution that enables teams to communicate in real time no matter where they are. Within our company, we saw the difficulties that teams had in effectively collaborating via traditional email services. We saw the need for a solution that combines the advantages of email communication with an effective way to collaborate. After extensive research and product improvements with teams from around the world, we are excited to launch ‘Zapmail’, a collaborative email service that integrates conversational emails, zero spam inbox, organised threads, and collaborative spaces for teams.” Zapmail’s developers move forward in search of solutions for the team to be able to collaborate in a professional setting while representing the brand of the organisation. Businesses, universities, organisations, and any other formal setting can now form a more cohesive digital environment to achieve their goals. Furthermore, because Zapmail is cloud-based, it is accessible from any device, allowing teams to continue their conversations from anywhere in the world. “We are just getting started, and our goal is to make business communication simple and effective for everyone by increasing productivity in organisations all over the world,” added the Co-Founders.

The ARF has 27-member States and Sri Lanka has been a member of the ARF since 2007. Addressing the forum, Foreign Minister Sabry highlighted the important areas of cooperation for Sri Lanka, including maritime security, disaster management, defence-related confidence building measures and preventive diplomacy, and for sustaining the growing economic dynamism and prosperity of the region. He also welcomed the steady advancement in the areas of cooperation in the ARF and unreservedly supported the process. The Foreign Minister said that Sri Lanka intends to become a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) which is the world’s largest free trade area that came into effect on 1 January 2022. Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam are the 15 founding members of the RCEP.

Specifically, the organisation requested that Sri Lanka develop a blueprint to generate both economic growth and prosperity driven by commercial aviation. The announcement was made by Philip Goh, IATA’s Regional Vice President for Asia-Pacific, at Aviation Day Sri Lanka, an event hosted by the organisation in partnership with the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL). In his remarks, Goh indicated facilitating growth, safety, and sustainability as three key areas for the South Asian nation to consider. Aviation maintains a critical role in 15 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Everything from trade and tourism to the creation of jobs and the alleviation of poverty relies on a thriving commercial aviation industry. “Sri Lanka’s aviation blueprint needs to facilitate the sustainable growth of the industry and having an updated airport masterplan is the first step. I urge the Government to engage in a consultative approach involving airlines to ensure that industry input is factored in,” Goh said. Goh urged Sri Lanka to digitise processes for passenger and cargo facilitation. “Many of the country’s passenger and cargo processes continue to be paper-based. As traffic grows, digitalisation will be key to address capacity constraints, increase efficiency and improve the travel experience. IATA’s One ID and One Record initiatives can help support this,” said Goh. Goh also highlighted the need to keep costs low, in particular jet fuel. Airlines pay more for jet fuel in Sri Lanka than at other major airports in Asia. He recognised much has been done in recent months to lower the cost of jet fuel, and encouraged the Government to review and consider placing limits or capping the amount that CEYPETCO can mark up for supplying fuel at the airport. “It is important for Sri Lanka’s aviation sector to grow sustainably in a safe manner, and IATA is doing our part to support the country’s efforts. Utilising the International Airlines Training Fund, IATA will support the aviation industry in Sri Lanka by conducting safety related training in August for CAASL and SriLankan Airlines,” said Goh. Goh encouraged the Government to explore how the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) and IATA Safety Audit for Ground Operations (ISAGO) can be used to contribute to greater aviation safety in Sri Lanka. “I am delighted that net zero carbon from aviation by 2050 is one of the stated policy goals of Sri Lanka’s sustainable aviation environment policy, including the need to ensure the availability of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in the country,” said Goh. SAF is expected to abate more than 60 per cent of aviation carbon emissions by 2050. Goh called on the Government to adopt a comprehensive consultation process involving airlines and other aviation stakeholders as the Government develops sustainability policies."

MP Rasamanickam said he also suspected the malpractices taking place at the Health Ministry could be the cause for the emergence of such a tragedy. A large number of officials appointed for the Dengue eradication programme in Batticaloa have not been made permanent and this should be looked into expeditiously, he said. He said if the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital was in dire straits, one can just imagine the state of the other divisional hospitals. “Hundreds of persons are dying, but employees attached to the Dengue eradication programme are working tirelessly to protect people,” the ITAK MP said. “These employees were appointed when President Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Premier and he needs to provide a sustainable solution, though they had been marginalised during the ‘Pohottuwa’ Governments,” MP Rasamanickam added.

The Sri Lanka Buddhist Lawyers’ Association said they condemn BASL for being silent on parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran’s statement criticising the judiciary and expressed its disappointment on the selective nature of the BASL’s stance, wherein it appears to be inconsistent in the application of its principles. The Sri Lanka Buddhist Lawyers’ Association said: First and foremost, it is essential to remind the BASL that it serves as the voice of the legal profession, and thus it has a responsibility to promote unity and fairness within the administration of justice. However, the said statement seems to align itself with sectarian views rather than focusing on the principles of justice and the rule of law. We note with disgust that the BASL was prompt in issuing a statement with regard to a speech made by parliamentarian Dr. Sarath Weerasekara, calling it a barren attack on the judiciary, when he was expressing his views of denial of freedom of religion at the several Bhikkus of the Kurundi Vihara. It is also surprising that the BASL was completely silent and did not think it fit to issue a similar statement condemning the blistering attack on the judiciary by parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran, who also happens to be a member of the BASL. During the debate on the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution Bill in Parliament, parliamentarian Sumanthiran had stated: “It is not only the Parliament that swings like a pendulum; it is (also) the Supreme Court judges of this country, so change that Supreme Court also. Ask them to go home if they can’t read and understand their own determination in the 19th Amendment, with the very same words, within a few years, they said no, this requires a referendum  How can that be? They are supposed to be learned?” This is a scathing attack by parliamentarian Sumanthiran on the Apex Court, and the Supreme Court judges of this country. However, quite shockingly the BASL remained silent, it underlined.                          (SM)"

Speaking at the opening of the New Zealand High Commission in Sri Lanka – being commemorated on Friday, 14 July on the occasion of Matariki or Māori New Year, he said this step will assist in forging stronger links between the two countries across all spheres, focusing primarily on advancing economic, trade, and investment partnerships. Pointing out that Sri Lanka and New Zealand are the oldest democracies in Asia and the Pacific and both countries are enjoying universal franchise since 1931, the Prime Minister thanked New Zealand for assisting to set up a Dental College in Maharagama in 1951 and the National Milk Board in 1956. The first few batches of nurses were trained in New Zealand. The IOH has produced nearly 1,000 qualified nurses (967) and 345 of them are presently in service. The IOH has conducted school dental clinics in 443 schools islandwide, he said. The Prime Minister urged New Zealand to further collaborate to upgrade the IOH by providing dental expertise and educational affiliations with New Zealand Dental Universities. High Commissioner Michael Appleton said the opening of the resident mission is a chance for the two countries to take their close relations to the next level. “Our Matariki holiday is about unity, renewal, celebration, hope, and a new beginning. It provides New Zealanders a chance to pause, reflect and look optimistically to the future,” Appleton said in his speech at the event. “In the spirit of Matariki, I would like to wish Sri Lankans, and indeed the Sri Lanka-New Zealand relationship, unity, hope and a new beginning.” The event also featured Ngati Koraha, a Māori kapahaka group with performances reflective of the culture of New Zealand’s indigenous people. Appleton said New Zealand, as a long-standing friend, had sought to assist Sri Lanka in its time of need. “At the height of the crisis last year, we provided humanitarian assistance targeting malnourished children and struggling farmers,” he said. “More recently, we have been focused on providing niche technical assistance in policy areas where we have expertise and where Sri Lankan authorities are seeking to make reform, such as on public financial management, governance, and diversity in political representation.” Appleton added that just as Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans had sought to adapt to the economic crisis, so had New Zealand tried to tailor its approach. “As Sri Lanka seeks to write a new chapter in its history, the New Zealand-Sri Lanka relationship is also adapting, renewing, and moving in different directions. In coming years, as Sri Lanka seeks to adapt, improve and reform in response to the crisis, New Zealand will be here in Colombo – a steady, friendly partner, looking for new ways to cooperate that benefit our two peoples, whether in commerce, education, tourism, sport, security, foreign policy or via our respective diasporas.” Ministers, MPs, diplomats and senior officials attended the event."

Secretary, Ministry of Industrial Development and others [2000]. According to the aforementioned judgment, the planned undertaking for phosphate mining and mineral extraction at Eppawala falls under the category of a Prescribed Project (pg. 306 of the Judgement) as stated in Part I (6) of Gazette Extraordinary No. 772/22 dated 24 June 1993, in accordance with Section 23Z of the National Environmental Act, No. 47 of 1980, as amended (NEA 1980).

I am instructed to state that you, your institution along with the other officials and the politicians have violated the above-mentioned binding rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of this country. In addition to that, I have been further instructed to state that you all have violated the existing statutes and Gazette Notifications with regard to the mining of phosphate and exporting such minerals. I have been further instructed to state that you all have violated the existing tender procedure in awarding the contract for the extraction of the minerals as well as the legal provisions related to purchasing and exportation. I have been further instructed by my clients to state that the existing tender procedure inter alia state as follows: The Procurement process should ensure: (a) maximising economy, timeliness and quality in Procurement resulting in least cost together with the high quality; (b) adhering to prescribed standards, specifications, rules, regulations and good governance; (c) providing fair, equal and maximum opportunity for eligible interested parties to participate in Procurement; (d) expeditious execution of Works and delivery of Goods and Services; (e) compliance with local laws and regulations and international obligations; (f) ensuring transparency and consistency in the evaluation and selection procedure; and (g) retaining confidentiality of information provided by bidders.

When the case was taken up, the accused was present in Court and on her pleading guilty to the charge filed against her the aforementioned punishment was imposed on her. Judge Balalle also ordered the accused to pay compensation of Rs 2 million and a fine of Rs 5,000 and ordered the passport of the accused which had been impounded by the Court, to be released back to her. The Court instructed its Registrar, to convey its decision in this regard, to the Controller General of the Department of Immigration and Emigration. When the case was taken up, the prosecution submitted its amended indictments against the accused, after being advised to do so, during the previous Pre-Trial Conference (PTC) of the case, by the Court. Thereafter, the accused Swiss Embassy official pleaded guilty to the charges filed against her and the Court thus imposed the said penalties on her. DSG Janaka Bandara prosecuted on behalf of the AG, while Kalinga Indatissa PC, represented the accused. The Second Officer of the Swiss Embassy in Colombo had lodged a written complaint with the then Acting IGP, on 27 November four years ago, that its official Ganiya Banister Francis, who is a resident of Maligawatta, had been abducted by a five-member gang in the Cinnamon Gardens area, three days earlier. The written complaint to the Acting IGP had further alleged, that Francis on being abducted by the gang, had been sexually abused, after which she had been detained and questioned, regarding providing visa facilities to Ex-CID sleuth Nishantha Silva and then released. The CID, had then commenced a probe into the alleged incident, based on advice from the Acting IGP and it had also been mentioned in the complaint, that the Embassy official, had been abducted, while she had been proceeding to her child’s school. The Colombo Chief Magistrate, at the time, ordered her passport to be impounded, over her failure to provide a statement on the incident to the CID, during the course of the latter’s probe into it. However, the Embassy staffer was then noticed to provide a statement to the CID, before 9 December 2019. The CID thereafter named Ganiya Francis, as a suspect in the case, on 16 December of that year, as per instructions from the then AG and subsequently the CID arrested her and produced her in Court. The suspect, who was then remanded, was enlarged on bail by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court on 30 December 2019. Lastly, the AG proceeded to indict her before the HC, two years ago on charges of furnishing bogus information, with the sinister intention of destabilising, the then regime.              By Hansi Nanayakkara   "

Among others who spoke at the media briefing were SLC General Secretary Dr. G. Weerasinghe, Patron of the SLC MP Ven. Athuraliye Ratana Thera and Deputy Secretary of the SLC MP Gevindu Cumaratunga. Speaking further, MP Weerawansa said, “It is clear to everyone that the present regime without taking any concrete measures to resolve the country’s economic crisis are continuing their merry way, while placing the lives of the people in jeopardy. On one side, there is an acute shortage of vital drugs in hospitals. On the other, there are serious issues concerning the quality of the drugs which are available in hospitals. The serious nature of this issue could be gauged from the fact that a young woman who had been admitted to hospital for a heart ailment had passed away due to substandard drugs which had been administered to her. The Health Ministry sans conducting requisite tests to determine the quality of drugs and antibiotics had bought such items as emergency purchases. They had bought most of these drugs from India. Due to this situation, scores of patients are being turned into lab rats. It could be argued that presently heading to the hospital is akin to being sent to the mortuary for the people of this country. If this situation is not resolved urgently, those who seek relief from the free medical service will be forced to look elsewhere as it will only be confined to mere words. Countries mired in an economic crisis do not opt for emergency purchases. Such countries have to formulate a proper tender process and then opt for suitable buyers. But, these people are allowing a drug scarcity to take place intentionally so they can opt for emergency purchases as there are commissions which could be obtained under the table. This has now turned into a crisis and now patients have started to die in their numbers. Thus, it has to be questioned whether there are such despicable politicians and State officers in any other country. It is also evident that the Health Minister continues to function in his post as if everything is hunky dory in the country’s health sector. They take prompt Cabinet decisions to fell or even uproot priceless trees such as Crudia zeylanica, but keep mum on removing either Cabinet Ministers or State Officers who are responsible for the deaths of innocent patients. This course of events has to be overturned sooner than later. The Health Ministry must cancel forthwith all so-called emergency purchases. They need to draft a plan to purchase vital drugs in advance. This system of allowing the Ministers and State officers to play with the innocent lives of patients has to end right now. That is why we demand that both the subject Minister and the Health Secretary must tender their respective resignations immediately. But, it seems they have no such intention and therefore this situation has to be described as terrible and unfortunate. But, we as the SLC are ready to do our best to rid this country of these despicable political characters and give fresh leadership and we implore our people to join forces with us in that onerous task.”"

Fernando,Author not found,0,2023-07-13T20:33:00+00:00," With former President Maithripala Sirisena requesting an extension period to settle the remaining sum of Rs 85 million as compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks, Director for National Catholic Mass Communication (NCMC), Fr. Jude Krishantha Fernando, lashing out, said he (the former President) should set an example to the citizens of Sri Lanka by abiding by the Court order. Fr. Fernando yesterday (13) pointed out that the compensation was not for those who had died in the violent attacks but for those victims who had survived with severe injuries for which they were still undergoing treatment. In some families, it was the breadwinner that died in the blasts leaving behind fatherless families with no support. Children of those families need support for their education. Therefore, it is an insult to these victims that those responsible for their misery were delaying and showing such reluctance to fulfil the Supreme Court ruling.  The Supreme Court held that the respondents had failed to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019 despite having received prior intelligence and had violated fundamental rights preserved under Article 12(1) and 14(1)(e) of the Constitution as a result. “The NCMC Media Director alleged that seven people holding responsible positions had violated the human rights of the victims and their families. They should not disobey that law but should at least now work towards uplifting the lives of those people who suffered. Or else they would only show that they were using their positions to violate the human rights of those victims further,” he said. He also warned that such a move would only serve to establish the opinion that the United Nations Human Rights Council has of Sri Lankans and its hierarchy. Fr. Fernando said there had been a large gathering of international media at the Vatican at the time the Easter Sunday victims visited it and that they too would be of the same opinion. They too would note that higher officials and even the former President of Sri Lanka were continuing to violate the human rights of victims. Only a part of the compensation money has been paid to the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks. While former President Sirisena has paid only Rs 15 million, he requested the Supreme Court for an extension to pay the outstanding amount of Rs 85 million through a series of ten equal instalments until 2033 Also, the National Intelligence Chief, Sisira Mendis has paid Rs 5 million and former IGP Pujith Jayasundara paid Rs 1.75 million. The former Defence Secretary has paid only Rs 1 million while the former SIS Director has paid Rs 4.1 million.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The new company is called xAI, and includes several engineers that have worked at companies like OpenAI and Google. Musk has previously stated he believes developments in AI should be paused and that the sector needs regulation. He said the start-up was created to “understand reality”. It is unclear how much funding the entity has, what its specific objectives are or what kind artificial intelligence the company wants to focus on. The company’s website says the goal of xAI is to “understand the true nature of the universe.” The new firm will host a Twitter Spaces chat on Friday, which may reveal further details about its aims. Elon Musk was the one of the original backers of OpenAI, which went on to create the popular large language model ChatGPT, which has – often controversially – become popular for uses such as assisting students with writing homework. However, the billionaire’s relationship with the company has soured. He has criticised ChatGPT for having a liberal bias. “What we need is TruthGPT”, Musk tweeted in February. He also disagrees with how ChatGPT has been run – and its close relationship with Microsoft. “It does seem weird that something can be a nonprofit, open source and somehow transform itself into a for-profit, closed source,” Musk said in a CNBC interview. In March, Musk signed an open letter calling for a pause to “Giant AI Experiments”, which to date has around 33,000 signatures. In an interview with the BBC in April Musk said he had been worrying about AI safety for over a decade. “I think there should be a regulatory body established for overseeing AI to make sure that it does not present a danger to the public”, he said. Musk has also pitted himself against AI companies due to the data they use to train chatbots – the software that learns how humans interacts by scraping masses of data from various sources to fuel its knowledge and interaction styles. The billionaire believes vast amounts of Twitter’s data is scraped from the platform, and that the company should be adequately compensated. Musk purchased the microblogging platform in a deal worth billions, before making sweeping changes which led to many leaving the platform in protest, including the producer of shows such as Grey’s Anatomy and Bridgerton, Shonda Rhimes, as well as model Gigi Hadid and comedian and actor Stephen Fry.

The Inaugural Session, held on 11 July 2023, was attended by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, as a Chief Guest, where he addressed the audience. Dr. Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, Minister of State, Chairman of the Prime Minister Task Force on Gandhara Tourism, was the Guest of Honour. In his address, the President of Pakistan lauded the initiative and reminded the audience that the Gandhara Civilisation held immense importance for the Pakistani nation, representing a powerful dimension of our rich cultural heritage. The President emphasised that in today’s world, where hatred is on the rise and increasing polarisation is fuelling conflicts, it’s time to rediscover the role of cultural diplomacy to promote dialogue among civilisations. He stressed that cultural diplomacy holds enormous potential to strengthen global ties. The journey to revive the glorious Gandhara Civilisation and Buddhist Heritage in Pakistan is thus vital in this regard. The President believed Gandhara was a learning centre that attracted intellectual discourse, and its cosmopolitan nature and cultural fusion fostered an environment of tolerance and harmony. He accentuated that reinventing humankind towards peace and harmony is the biggest challenge today. To address this, the President recommended that the message of peace from religions is the most important one that the world needs today. The movement to end violence in the world is perhaps the most important today. It can emanate in the form of a message of peace from Buddha. Dr. Ramesh Kumar Vankwani stressed that the revival of the Gandhara civilisation is a dream that necessities the encouragement of all stakeholders. This Symposium symbolises a commitment to the revival of Gandhara civilisation and Pakistan’s rich Buddhist Heritage. He stated that the soft power of cultures needs to be capitalised on. In this regard, collaboration within the country among all stakeholders as well as cooperation from other countries is vital. Gandhara tourism, he quoted, has the potential to draw five lack people to Pakistan that can bring about USD 1.5 billion in revenue in its first year, followed by USD 3 billion and USD 6 billion per year. He also spoke about his plan to promote tourism in Pakistan by giving new breath to the great legacy of Gandhara. This will also help in improving the prosperous and peaceful image of Pakistan. Session I of the Gandhara Symposium was on the theme ‘Pathways to Peace: Exploring Pakistan’s Rich Buddhist Legacy.’ The speakers were religious scholars and faith leaders from Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea, Nepal, Sri Lanka and China. The speakers agreed that Gandhara was a major centre for Buddhist learning and education and recommended preserving the Buddhist Gandhara Heritage in Pakistan. Session II discussed ‘Gandhara Civilisation: Celebrating Pakistan’s Buddhist Heritage.’ The panel of the second session’s presenters comprised experts, faith leaders and religious scholars who emphasized that Buddhist Gandhara Heritage is paramount to Pakistan. Pakistan is blessed with rich culture and is a hub of civilisation. The Punjab and Sindh have landmark historical sites with excellent archaeological research and spiritual tourism opportunities. Pakistan’s Buddhist legacy offers a pathway to peace, harmony and tranquillity. The best way to preserve cultural heritage is to share it with the world and allow them to be part of this world. The panellists suggested that the Buddhist Heritage has economic potential and educational attraction. They recommended promoting Gandhara Heritage to the world and creating economic opportunities for Pakistan. The speakers stressed that we must try to dispel the misconceptions about Pakistan and build trust among Buddhist people so, that Buddhists can come to Pakistan from around the world. Session III of the Gandhara Symposium delved into ways of ‘Promoting Tourism: Creating an Enabling Environment.’ Experts from Pakistan’s tourism industry and think tanks were invited as speakers. The panellists agreed that efforts need to be put in to develop the tourist industry of Pakistan that presents a positive image of the country. They suggested that special attention should be given to various tourism-related sectors such as visa regimes, film and media, hospitality, culinary, museums, tours and tourist centres to promote the potential of Gandhara tourism in Pakistan. Lastly, an illustrious panel of religious experts, academics, curators, faith leaders and other stakeholders gathered for a Roundtable on ‘Gandhara Civilisation: Opportunities and Challenges.’ Pakistan is a safe place for tourism, and this conference conveys this message aptly. Pakistan is going to start Gandhara Tourism, and it is ready to collaborate with other countries to enhance B2B and P2P contacts. The roundtable concluded that the lack of security structure, awareness and marketing, funds for preservation and restoration, unsupervised hotels, underdeveloped roads, tourist safety, and lack of modern tourism infrastructure were a few of the mentioned challenges."

Education Secretary of the All Ceylon Nurse’s Union (ACNU), Prabath Palipane lamented yesterday (13) that the Ministry had blamed the ward staff and the doctor who prescribed the drug and the nurse who administered it in a drug-related incident which claimed the life of a 23-year-old woman at the Colombo North Teaching Hospital early this month. “It is not the hospital staff who import these medicinal drugs but the Health Ministry and the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA),” he said. “All these years there had been only one or two pharmaceutical companies purchasing certain medicines but now there seemed to be a change of the company almost every month. Additionally, there should be facilities for testing the medicines which are imported. But even the facilities for testing are poor. Instead of getting their act together, the Health Ministry has squarely placed the blame on the ward staff,” Palipane lamented. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry withheld batches of two anaesthetic drugs which caused the deaths of three patients. Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry, Saman Ratnayake said on Wednesday (12) that batches, DP 2100, DP2202 and DP 2203 of the Bupivacaine injection had been withheld by the NMRA.        By Dilanthi Jayamanne "

This course of events has to be overturned sooner than later. The Health Ministry must cancel forthwith all so-called emergency purchases. They need to draft a plan to purchase vital drugs in advance. This system of allowing the Ministers and State officers to play with the innocent lives of patients has to end right now. That is why we demand that both the subject Minister and the Health Secretary must tender their respective resignations immediately. But, it seems they have no such intention and therefore this situation has to be described as terrible and unfortunate. But, we as the SLC are ready to do our best to rid this country of these despicable political characters and give fresh leadership and we implore our people to join forces with us in that onerous task.”"

Addressing the SJB Blueprint media briefing, MP Harsha de Silva said these amendments will be presented by the Economic Council of SJB and that the amendment proposals will guide the members to determine a certain minimum return or to pay an interest return equal to the interest income received for other investments or to pay a capital interest. “To protect the benefits due to the members of the EPF, Colombo District Samagi Jana Balawegaya will bring amendments to the Employees’ Provident Fund Act introduced by T.B. Ilangaratne in 1958. At present, there are 19.6 million accounts in this fund. Of these, about 2.6 million beneficiaries are active. The benefits they receive should be permanent for the next 15 years. That’s why we hope to submit these amendments,” de Silva said. De Silva noted that there have been accusations that in the recent domestic debt optimisation, the burden has been placed unilaterally on the EPF and that this violates the principles of fairness.

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

He accepted that Premachandra had helped him in the past, but insisted that he has no intention of whitewashing the incident over it. Ahead of the cross-examination, Defence Counsel Eraj Fernando charged that the first witness had provided bogus evidence in Court, with the sole motive of tarnishing his client’s public image. The first witness maintained that submissions produced before Court, by him, were true and genuine and observed that it had not been his aim, to either tarnish anyone’s public image or sling mud at someone politically. The witness was of the view, that due to the severe mental anguish experienced by him over the incident and due to the sufferings he had undergone during the past few years, some of the details related to it, were hard to recall presently. The Defence Counsel stated that the alleged incident had taken place, without his client’s knowledge and stressed that hence it was unfair to level baseless and fabricated charges against her. The witness added that he had no intention of gaining any political mileage over the incident and that it was his sincere aim, to highlight the injustice meted out to him, at the hands of the accused former MP. Thereafter, the HC Judge ordered further hearing of the evidence, to be deferred to 14 December, when the 18th witness to the trial, a Chief Inspector attached to the CCD, is slated to testify. The AG has indicted Premachandra and seven of her aides, before the HC on the charge of forced abduction and intimidation of a youth, who had been employed at a textile shop in Colombo 9, on 21 December eight years ago. However, the seven aides of the accused pleaded guilty to the charges filed against them, on 24 November 2017 and they were imposed with two years RI, which were suspended for 12 years by the HC. The HC then ordered the charges filed against the former lawmaker, to be maintained, as she refused to plead guilty, to the charges filed against her.  By Hansi Nanayakkara"

Although some of the party’s founding motivations have yet to be realised, the Communist Party has managed to bring several victories to the people of Sri Lanka. From full independence to the establishment of the welfare sector of the economy, the Communist Party has made enormous contributions to the motherland. The Communist Party’s 80th Anniversary coincides with Sri Lanka’s economic crisis. Before any party predicted or attempted to remedy the situation, the Sri Lankan Communist Party published a Book titled “What needs to be done and what should be prioritised” in 2019, which was given to then-presidential candidate and later Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. However, due to the lack of attention to policy-driven politics that pervades Sri Lankan political culture, this proposal was rejected. That government’s fate was a result of its aimless politics. Despite the fact that Sri Lankan political culture is based on superficial rhetoric, the Communist Party proposed a short-term policy proposal based on an empirical analysis of the crisis. This was published and submitted to the appropriate authorities at the time. The short-term policy proposal of the Communist Party addresses various aspects of the crisis, including debt restructuring, welfare renovation, financial innovation, food security, and various fiscal adjustments. Since its inception, the Communist Party has understood the Sri Lankan problem in terms of capital dynamics and the labour relations that result from them (so-called class contradiction). The first “idirimaga (Way Forward)” clearly mentions the existing stage of capital development and class contradictions. Sri Lanka, like all former imperial colonies, is confronted with the problem of dispositioned modes of production. In contrast to advanced economies, colonial countries were occupied by an external force at some point in their history and rearranged their mode of production to meet the needs of the coloniser rather than the country’s national interest. When a country achieves constitutional independence, its modes of production must also achieve independence and align with its national interests. For a variety of reasons, this is a long-term project. Despite the fact that dispositioned modes of production have significant economic externalities for the country’s development, they also contribute to the existing economy. In the sector, there are already stakeholders. These industries employ a sizable number of people. As a result, such industries cannot be ignored. Instead, to industrialise and increase productivity, we must propose an industrial plan for such sectors of the economy. Industrialisation will not only strengthen labour-capital relations, but it will also decouple these sectors of the economy from their colonial roots. Apart from Marshall Plan countries, only a few colonial countries are rapidly modernising, with Marxist-Leninist-ruled China and Vietnam being the best examples. The majority of postcolonial countries that had previously dispositioned production modes were compelled to undergo emerging neoliberal economic reforms. Neoliberalism is a global bourgeois reaction to the stagnant productivity of the global economy. This includes decreasing government intervention in the economy, privatising State-owned assets, and reducing welfare. As a result of neoliberal reforms, postcolonial economies (except Vietnam and China) were forced to undergo a condition known as premature deindustrialisation. In the case of Sri Lanka, neoliberal reforms were imposed on the country’s economy in 1977. Neoliberal reforms not only deindustrialised the economy but also exacerbated Sri Lanka’s colonial legacies. Neoliberal reforms inherited a chronic ‘balance of payment’ problem as a result of the economy’s lower relative productivity in comparison to the rest of the world. Rather than addressing the root cause of the crisis, governments after 1977 focused on debt absorption to address the ‘balance of payment’ problem. The national debt then ballooned to the point of default in 2022. Industrialisation, progressive segments of society should recognise, is the path to national liberation from its colonial capital relationship. Industrialisation not only improves our citizens’ quality of life but also prepares the country to defend its sovereignty. The majority of countries around the world defend their sovereignty by industrialising. As a result, the Communist Party proposes a policy path for Sri Lanka called Idirimagen Idiriyata, which provides an overview of the country’s sectors as well as a path forward.  Our policy approach to Sri Lanka is technically driven, pragmatic, and fundamentally based on our motherland’s best interests. Our 80-year legacy demonstrates that the Communist Party of Sri Lanka is one of the country’s few parties that has always fought for the country’s best interests. The policy proposal of the Sri Lankan Communist Party envisions a socially harmonious, technologically advanced, and environmentally sustainable path for our motherland. Times may change. But the spirit is eternal. The Communist Party of Sri Lanka’s, Education Dept"

Industrialisation not only improves our citizens’ quality of life but also prepares the country to defend its sovereignty. The majority of countries around the world defend their sovereignty by industrialising. As a result, the Communist Party proposes a policy path for Sri Lanka called Idirimagen Idiriyata, which provides an overview of the country’s sectors as well as a path forward.  Our policy approach to Sri Lanka is technically driven, pragmatic, and fundamentally based on our motherland’s best interests. Our 80-year legacy demonstrates that the Communist Party of Sri Lanka is one of the country’s few parties that has always fought for the country’s best interests. The policy proposal of the Sri Lankan Communist Party envisions a socially harmonious, technologically advanced, and environmentally sustainable path for our motherland. Times may change.

Aluthgamage also pointed out that there are 105,000 registered limited companies in the country, but 82 per cent of the tax revenue is received from only 382 companies. Elaborating on the failure of the Inland Revenue Department to collect the tax revenue, the Committee also discussed about the collection of Rs 904 billion in arrears which is due to the Inland Revenue Department. Aluthgamage also emphasised that it is important to maintain the inflation, the reserves of the country and the Government’s income in an optimal condition by December by the time of the second review of the International Monetary Fund, given that the said factors must be considered when granting loans. Therefore, it was agreed that the Committee will hold regular discussions with Sri Lanka Customs, Excise Department and Inland Revenue Department to provide necessary facilities to increase State revenue. Aluthgamage said he would also provide his utmost support to fill the existing employee vacancies in the Inland Revenue Department. The Inland Revenue Commissioner General, speaking at the occasion, said he appreciated the support received from the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Economic and Physical Plans to make the work of his department efficient. The Commissioner stated that the tax revenue target given by the Government for the year 2023 of Rs 1.6 trillion was expected to be earned by 40 per cent in the first 6 months and 60 per cent in the remaining 6 months, and the target for the first 6 months has already been met. In addition, he said work is underway to generate expected tax revenue in the remaining 6 months. The Committee also insisted on the need to establish a systematic mechanism to regulate the collection of tax revenue. Members as well as officials pointed out that because the data provided for the registration of companies in this country is not genuine, they face problems in tax collection. The Committee also discussed at length the need to set up a digital data system linking the Sri Lanka Customs Department, the Excise Department and the Inland Revenue Department as soon as possible, as well as the need to re-register the private tax file in the country.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/07/13/igps-second-service-extension-unlawful-gammanpila/,IGP’s second service extension unlawful – Gammanpila,Author not found,0,2023-07-12T20:34:00+00:00,"Leader of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Udaya Gammanpila says the country had been devoid of an IGP for 108 days since 26 March. He alleged that granting a second service extension to outgoing IGP C.D. Wickramaratne is unlawful and stressed that it could create a dangerous precedent as well. He was speaking at a media briefing held at the PHU Office yesterday (12). Speaking further, he said, “The media here reported that the outgoing IGP had been handed a service extension with the consent of both the President and the Minister of Public Security. However, that service extension is illegal on two fronts. As per Article 41 (1) of the Constitution, the President has no powers vested in his post to make appointments unless those that had been approved by the CC. This Provision in the Constitution states that it also is valid even for an Acting Officer who is appointed for a 14-day period. The President went ahead and ratified a three-month service extension to Wickramaratne on 28 March sans the consent of the CC. He only received the approval on 1 April. Hence, it is crystal clear as per Provisions of Article 41 (1) of the Constitution that the President has no powers to appoint an IGP ahead of the nominee being green lighted by the CC. Even now, the President has given a three-month extension to the retiring IGP sans the ratification of the CC. Therefore, as per the law, this service extension has to be described as unlawful and if challenged in Court it could be deemed as null and void.  That in other words further underscores the fact that this country is still without a legally binding IGP. As per the laws drafted under the Public Judicial Officers (Retirement) Ordinance though the retirement age had been fixed at 60 any officer could be granted a service extension if the requisite official is of the view that his or her services are required for that particular firm’s growth and profits.  However, it must not be forgotten that this service extension can only be given to one who is still in active service. But, Wickramaratne went into his retirement on 28 March and there are no Provisions in the law to grant service extensions to those who had retired. It is due to this reason that the President appointed Wickramaratne anew to his post on 28 March.  But, there are no provisions in the law to appoint those who had exceeded the retirement age. That is why we say that before the law the appointment given to the outgoing IGP is unlawful. Therefore, it could be argued that since 28 March this country has been without an IGP. The one who is functioning in his current post is illegal. Hence, the question has to be asked as to how Police Officers would be able to perform their duty while their head is operating unlawfully.”     "

He also said the Government spent Rs 144 billion on welfare benefits last year and as per the agreements with the IMF and World Bank, Sri Lanka had agreed to spend a minimum of Rs 187 billion annually on welfare benefits. It has taken about 20 years to put in place a systematic and transparent method to identify the underprivileged and those in need of welfare benefits, the State Minister added. “Out of the 982,770 appeals received thus far, 650,000 appeals have been received from individuals whose names are already in the published list,” he said. Meanwhile, the first payment will be made within this month for all beneficiaries selected and who have not received objections or appeals, the State Minister said. Commencing from 1 August, those who could not apply for ‘Aswesuma” this year or failed to submit appeals will have another chance to do so, he added. He expressed these views yesterday (12) during a media briefing themed ‘Collective Path to a Stable Country’ held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). State Minister Semasinghe further said, “The time period given to all applicants whose names were not included in the list of ‘Aswesuma’ beneficiaries to file appeals ended on 10 July. Accordingly, 982,770 appeals and 62,368 objections have been received thus far. Arrangements have been made to commence investigations pertaining to these appeals and objections received by the Divisional Secretaries under the supervision of District Secretaries. Out of the 982,770 appeals that have been received thus far, significantly 650,000 appeals have been received by the individuals whose names are already in the published list demanding to upgrade their names from the category they are already in, to a category with more benefits. Only after investigating these appeals will a final decision be made regarding which categories the benefits should be distributed under. They will either stay in the category they have been chosen for or have their category modified. In addition to this, only about 350,000 appeals have been received from those who have not been selected. A total of 1,287,747 families already receiving ‘Samurdhi’ benefits have applied for ‘Aswesuma’. Out of them, 70 per cent (887,653) family units have been identified to be eligible to receive ‘Aswesuma’. As per the directions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, it has been decided to execute the current list of beneficiaries receiving differently-abled, elderly, and kidney support allowances without subjecting to any change until a new system is implemented within a time period of 3-6 months. We are working to make the first payment within this month for all candidates elected and who have not received objections or appeals. We believed we would get more than 800,000 appeals. Accordingly, the appeals we have received thus far are within our estimated amount. Accordingly, these appeals and objections will be promptly investigated and if the investigations reveal that he/ she/ family unit, is eligible to receive ‘Aswesuma’, their  ‘Aswesuma’ allowance due in July, will be added to the August allowance and paid to that family. ‘Aswesuma’ hopes not to cut off any benefits received by low-income groups or individuals receiving any form of welfare benefits but to enter all who are eligible into the welfare system without losing anyone.” By Sanjana Marzook"

While I won’t delve into this at length, we presented several solutions during the Bar Association meeting held in Nuwara Eliya. To tackle this issue, a comprehensive discussion has taken place among various stakeholders, including the Chief Justice, relevant Government Ministers, Judges representing the Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal, High Courts, and District Magistrate Courts, as well as Members of Parliament from the ruling party and the Opposition, representatives from the Attorney General’s Department, and the Bar Association,” the President said while declaring open the new Court Complex built in Ratnapura. This collaborative effort instils hope, recognising that this is a long-term problem that cannot be resolved by one group blaming another, he added. President Wickremesinghe also pointed out that the country’s current laws must undergo reform as some laws have remained unchanged for as long as the Courts themselves. “The Police Ordinance, for example, has remained unaltered for 175 years. Our Justice Minister is particularly focused on addressing this issue. In the past, new laws were enacted every six months, but now we are witnessing frequent introductions of new legislation,” he noted. The President also said it is anticipated that, by the end of this year, Parliament will need to convene for three weeks instead of the usual two to pass these laws. Meanwhile, speaking at the event, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the Ministry of Justice has already presented over 30 new bills to combat corruption within the country. This serves as a reminder that we remain committed to establishing a future where adherence to the law is paramount, he added."

As per Section 42 of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance No. 2 of 1937 as amended by Act, No. 22 of 2009, no person shall in any area remove, uproot or destroy or cause any damage or injury to any plant which is for the time being included in Schedule V and is growing on the property of any other person or is growing in any public place,” CEJ noted. “Therefore, the entire Cabinet who supported and approved his (Gunawardana’s) proposal has committed a legal offence which can be subjected to an imprisonment of 2 to 5 years and a fine of Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000,” CEJ Chairman, Dr. Ravindranath Dabare pointed out. CEJ also highlighted that at a time when a social conversation is going on about the danger of people taking the law into their own hands, it is sad to see Cabinet Ministers engaging in ultra vires activities in violating people’s environmental human rights. Regardless of the nature or orientation of social discourses regarding the plant Crudia zeylanica, illegal interventions pose a formidable threat to the preservation of the rule of law. The CEJ strongly condemns this act and emphasises that no minister or Cabinet has the authority to override the law, he added. (GW)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The incident occurred approximately 431 nautical miles off the southwestern coast of Galle. The ill-fated multiday fishing trawler, named ‘Sachintha Putha’, bearing registration number IMUL-A-0460 CHW, embarked on its fishing voyage from Negombo Harbour on 22 June, carrying a crew of five. However, fate took an unexpected turn when the trawler collided with a foreign vessel on the high seas southwest of Sri Lanka. The reports suggest that the collision resulted in a harrowing attack by the foreign vessel, leading to severe burn injuries for one of the fishermen aboard the local trawler. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident are presently under investigation. Promptly alerted to the situation, the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources swiftly contacted the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) located at the Navy Headquarters in Colombo. Recognising the gravity of the situation, the Sri Lanka Navy mobilised its resources to rescue the injured fisherman from the distressed multiday fishing trawler. Undeterred by the vast distance, the Sri Lanka Navy’s skilled personnel braved the challenging conditions to reach the vessel located approximately 431 nautical miles from the coast. Their professionalism and dedication ensured the safe evacuation of the injured fisherman, who required urgent medical attention. Following the successful rescue operation, the Sri Lanka Navy facilitated the fisherman’s immediate transfer to a suitable medical facility on land. Medical professionals are now providing the necessary care and treatment to aid his recovery. As the investigation unfolds, authorities are working diligently to ascertain the details surrounding the collision and the motives behind the foreign vessel’s attack. By Dinithi Wijesundara"

Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Media Spokesman, Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe yesterday (12) said with the dilemma regarding the National Wage Policy which had been violated one too many times, his outfit had seen this as the best possible solution to put a plug on Sri Lankan medical practitioners leaving the island in search of greener pastures. He noted that the Rs 30 or Rs 50 that a medical practitioner in the Outpatient Department (OPD) receives for seeing a patient was very much less than what an OPD doctor was paid in a private sector hospital. He lamented that State health service authorities had grossly failed to provide a proper value for the employment of all categories of doctors including interns considering their market value. The situation could be amended by introducing a special salary structure for doctors based on performance and market value while revising the pay packet of interns accordingly. GMOA Secretary, Dr. Haritha Aluthge noted that his union had continued to emphasise the importance of proper management of human resources in the field to manage the State health system in the best way possible. The provision of quality healthcare islandwide had largely contributed towards the recognition of the island’s free health service even internationally. Dr. Aluthge said implementing the eight-step solution proposed by his outfit would prevent the impending collapse that was going to happen in the health system in the near future. The eight-pronged solution to the looming crisis in the State health service includes the announcement of a work plan to increase the residential facilities of doctors within a given time frame, mainly targeting the difficult peripheral hospitals. He noted that the union had identified the non-payment of proper attention to increase the transportation facilities of the doctors who are dedicated to all island service to be a bone of contention for medical practitioners. To resolve this issue prompt measures should be taken to revise the Disturbance Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance in accordance with the present-day criteria and update the related allowance once in three years. Also, including ‘medical officers’ in Circular 22/99 of the Ministry of Public Administration for the provision of official transport facilities provided to senior-grade public services.

In Analog TV broadcasting, Japan supported the setting up of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) which started its TV broadcasting in 1982, and since then, Japan has been continuously providing technical cooperation to SLRC. Japan said, now it is time for Sri Lanka to move to the digitalisation of TV broadcasting through the DTTB Project. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/07/13/cope-highlights-irregularities-in-coconut-industry/,COPE highlights irregularities in coconut industry,Author not found,0,2023-07-12T20:32:00+00:00,"The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) which met recently disclosed many administrative concerns and irregularities in the Coconut Development Authority, Coconut Cultivation Board and Coconut Research Institute. The Committee expressed strong displeasure that the online system introduced to stop the monopoly mafia in coconut auctions and to create transparency remains inactive. COPE also gave instructions to discuss with all three institutions and prepare a common programme for the control of diseases that can affect coconut cultivation. The last application of fertiliser to the crops in the lands belonging to the Coconut Cultivation Board was in 2016, COPE revealed and was also concerned that 78 per cent of the coconut oil consumption in the country is met by imported oil. The three main institutions related to coconut cultivation and industry of the country which are the Coconut Development Authority, Coconut Cultivation Board and Coconut Research Institute were called before COPE at the meeting held recently chaired by Prof. Ranjith Bandara. The progress of the implementation of the recommendations given to the said institutions during the COPE meeting held on 21 January 2021 was also reviewed. Developing a common programme Considering it as an emergency, a special committee was appointed to control the whitefly disease affecting the coconut plantation and the need to prepare a common programme was discussed with the three institutions to control the diseases that could affect the coconut plantation. As the Coconut Development Authority has not been involved in the ‘National Disaster Management Operational Unit’ which has been established so far, the need to involve the institution was also emphasised for this operation. Officials stated that there is a risk of diseases like this due to the non-application of fertiliser at the right time for coconut cultivation. It was also revealed that the last application of fertiliser to the crops in the lands belonging to the Coconut Cultivation Board was in 2016. The displeasure of the Committee was expressed regarding the non-application of fertiliser to government-owned coconut plantations The Secretary to the Ministry of Plantation Industries was recommended to inform within two weeks action to be taken by involving all three institutions. Accordingly, the COPE Chair said, he will inform Parliament, the Treasury and the President’s Secretary about the provision of necessary resources in this regard. Instructions to re-implement online system Although computer software has been prepared for online bidding for the coconut auction, attention was drawn to the fact that it is presently inactive. It was revealed that this system will enable the auction to be conducted more transparently and this system was introduced to prevent the monopoly of a few people in the coconut auction in Sri Lanka. It was also discussed that some officials of the authority expressed their reluctance to implement this online digital system with the cooperation of several brokers. Thus, instructions were given to restore this online system to conduct this auction with more transparency within three months. Need to increase domestic coconut oil production It was revealed that 187,623 metric tonnes of coconut oil and 225,510 metric tonnes of palm oil have been imported for consumption in the country during 2020-2022. Thus, it was discussed that 22 per cent of the coconut oil consumption in the country is met from domestic production and 78 per cent from imported oil, which is a big problem. Further, there was a long discussion about the quality of imported coconut oil. Accordingly, it was decided to call the relevant institutions including the Coconut Development Authority, Consumer Authority, and Ministry of Health and conduct a comprehensive investigation. Advance of Rs 1 million to a private firm A contract of nearly Rs 5 million was awarded to a private firm in 2021 without a contract to construct a digital outdoor billboard in front of the Narahenpita Head Office of the Coconut Development Authority. The Director of Finance stated that Rs 1 million has been given as an advance and the payment was made under a certain influence. Accordingly, the Secretary to the Ministry was instructed to conduct a comprehensive investigation into this matter within two weeks and expose those responsible. Apart from this, it was also decided to conduct a separate investigation by the Auditor General. Recruitment of six persons by the ex-Chairman who did not properly appear for interviews It was also revealed that six people who did not properly appear for interviews of the Coconut Cultivation Board were recruited by the former Chairman at will. Expressing strong displeasure over this, the Committee informed to provide a formal report within two weeks. It was also decided to inform the President’s Secretary to take further action in this regard. Supply coir for Saudi Arabia Since there is a project of planting 50 million trees in Saudi Arabia, there are discussions for the process of procuring the required coir, so the need to get it from Sri Lanka was discussed. The need to be more active in this regard was emphasised during the Committee meeting as it is a project that can generate millions of dollars for the country. Attention directed to other administrative problems The Committee questioned the operations of Dunkannawa Coir Development and Training Centre which was started in 2006 by the Coconut Development Authority being stopped since 2020. As there is a risk of destruction of machinery worth millions of rupees, the Chairman of the authority was ordered to submit a report on this within a month. Also, the Committee emphasised the need to increase the legal bond with the institution before the commencement of the research and to recover the loss due to the departure of the research officers of the Coconut Research Board after spending millions of rupees to start the research. Members of Parliament Jagath Pushpakumara, Shantha Bandara, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Eran Wickramaratne, Nimal Lanza, S.M.M.

In rupee terms too, the decline was sharp, falling by 1.75 per cent (Rs 270.86) to Rs 974.36 a kilo. Meanwhile, NTSAPs in the first six months of the year gained by 1.92 per cent (USC 7) to USD 3.71 a kg, while its gain in rupee terms was much sharper, by 19.17 per cent (Rs 197.26) to Rs 1,226.08 a kg., Forbes data further showed. When analyzing the correlation between US dollar and rupee prices,  records showed that the rupee (‘spot’) YoY to June 30 2023 has had appreciated by between 14.72 and 15.38 per cent(Rs 53 and Rs 56) to Rs 307/308 per US dollar in two way quotes. A ‘strong’ ‘spot’ means that an exporter gets fewer rupees for his dollar earnings, while the reverse is true in the case of a weak ‘spot,’ where an exporter will get more rupees for his dollars.  However, a strong ‘spot’ favours importers because that means he would be able to import goods by spending a fewer rupees to purchase his dollars to make such imports and under perfect circumstances passing on the benefits of such low  import values to the consumer as well.  As Sri Lanka is an import driven economy, a strong ‘spot’ helps to drive down demand-pull inflationary pressure. On the other hand a strong ‘spot rupee’ may make it difficult for exporters to be competitive in the global market, particularly so if its competitors operate in economies where their domestic currencies  are relatively weak vis-à-vis the dollar. Tea was Sri Lanka’s fourth largest foreign exchange earner last year, behind garments, remittances and IT and IT Enabled Exports in that descending order, latest Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Export Development Board data showed.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The AG, in a letter addressed to the Secretary-General of Parliament, had informed he is of the opinion that clause 2 of the legislation is inconsistent with Articles 3, 4, 12(1) and 14(1) of the Constitution and that it has to be enacted with a special majority and through a referendum. “Further, a dissolved local authority may be re-convened for an indefinite period of time without any nexus to the crisis referred to in the proposed provision. Therefore, the proposed amendment would have the effect of extending the terms of local authorities and delaying elections, and members of local authorities who have exceeded their term limit as elected representatives of the people could continue in office for an indefinite period of time without a democratically obtained mandate.

Jagoda also claimed that the credit for transforming this country economically and educationally must go to the UNP. During the present economic and political crisis many who are well-versed in politics were demanding a new political equation, according to Jagoda. He said the country’s development and the UNP are interconnected and inseparable. “When the UNP rears its head, the country’s economy will also start to bloom,” he added. “At a time when normalcy is being restored, a programme to revamp the UNP and make it a victorious force in the country once again is underway including in the North and South,” Jagoda said. He said, serious allegations were levelled against the UNP in the past with regard to the Rs 10 billion Treasury Bond Scam, adding that even in that circumstance President Ranil Wickremesinghe acted prudently and carried out a Rs 12 billion transaction, according to Jagoda.

Communication rights involve freedom of opinion and expression, participation in one’s own culture, linguistic rights, rights to education, privacy and assembly, he said. “If I may recap, I’m in Galle Face Hotel today, and one year ago just outside this place at Galle Face Green, there was anarchy. Let me recall, under President Ranil Wickremesinghe, we have been able to restore law and order in the country with the support of the people. And also restore economic stability,” he said. The Prime Minister expressed gratitude to the Government of Canada for the financial support extended to the NLEAP Project and thanked High Commissioner Eric Walsh for his support to extend the project to help Sri Lanka to achieve its objective of equal advancement in national language usage. He said the objective of the Official Languages Policy of Sri Lanka is to enhance acceptance by Sri Lankan women and men of the cultural diversity in the country. “Overcoming communication barriers also help in speedy economic development and ensuring uniformity in development. That in turn helps to reduce poverty and improve economic and social equality of Sinhala and Tamil speaking women and men throughout Sri Lanka,” he said. Director of National Languages Equality Advancement Project, Michael Emblem said the NLEAP project has served as a forum for academics, students and professionals to focus on specific challenges relating to the multilingual nature of Sri Lanka and gender-based barriers and to find solutions to them. Canadian High Commissioner Eric Walsh said, Canada as a bilingual nation has shared its experiences with Sri Lanka through NLEAP project. MP Dilan Perera, Kulasingham Thilipan and Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs Ranjith Ashoka, diplomats, officials, academics and students took part in this Symposium."

In 2019, ICMME was inaugurated following a suggestion made by the Ministry of Education in enhancing mathematical literacy in the country by providing a unique platform for Mathematics Educators, especially to expose school teachers to diverse aspects of research in mathematics. The theme of the Conference was set forth as ‘Mathematics for a Better World’ considering the significance and impact of the subject. PGIS organised the first ICMME in collaboration with the Education Ministry and the National Institute of Education (NIE). Based on its significant success, the organising committee decided to hold the conference biennially. The second ICMME was held in 2021, once more in collaboration with the Education Ministry. In addition to holding the Conference, the organising committee had also organised a series of workshops in 2021 to provide hands-on experience to school teachers on various aspects of research in Mathematics Education, and also how to use the two softwares – ‘GeoGebra’ and ‘Minitab’ – as interactive teaching aids. Marking another milestone, the third ICMME will take place on 14 and 15 July at the PGIS premises. Since last year, several pre-Conference events were organised; a workshop on the use of certain software as teaching aids, three talks by distinguished local mathematicians on effective teaching of mathematics to schoolchildren, workshops on preparing an Abstract, extended Abstract, presentation slides, and awareness sessions on the resources available at the Faculty of Science for the target audience. The inauguration ceremony of ICMME 2023 will be held with the participation of Chief Guest, Dr. Athira S. (Assistant High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka), Prof. M.D. Lamawansa (Vice Chancellor, University of Peradeniya) and Prof. Terrence Madhujith (Deputy Vice Chancellor, University of Peradeniya). The keynote address will be delivered via Zoom by Prof. Asha Rao, Associate Dean of Mathematical Sciences at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University in Australia. The two plenary addresses on the second day of the Conference will be delivered by Prof. Berinderjeet Kaur, Professor of Mathematics Education at the NIE and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, and by Prof. Dinesh Ekanayake, Professor and Graduate Coordinator in the Department of Mathematics and Philosophy at Western Illinois University. A rigorous review process which involved an initial double-blind review that took place over several weeks resulted in choosing Abstracts with significant contributions to be presented at the Conference. This review was done with the assistance of local and international subject experts. The technical sessions will be held on the second day of the Conference during which more than 60 research studies will be presented via Zoom. The participants will get the unique opportunity to receive feedback from experts in the fields of Mathematics and Mathematics Education, and also to interact with the audience and share their interests. Each research study will be published in the Proceedings of the Conference whose e-copy will be sent to the participants along with a Certificate of accomplishment. In conclusion, the organising committee of ICMME 2023 believes that the research findings and the up-to-date knowledge inculcated at the pre-Conference workshops will pave the way to enhance mathematical literacy in the country which will result in enhancing the teaching-learning process of mathematics.

This was disclosed during a meeting held on 6 July, chaired by State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna. COPA highlighted that only 40 per cent of the daily liquid milk requirement is being produced, resulting in a 60 per cent deficit. According to the officials, 15,000 farms capable of producing 100 litres of milk per day have been set up to address the shortfall in liquid milk production. By setting up these farms, the authorities are actively working to bridge the gap in liquid milk production and fulfil the daily requirements of the country. It is a significant effort to boost milk production and reduce the present shortfall. The officials pointed out that approximately 2,000 farms have already been registered for this purpose. Recognising the severity of the situation, the COPA Chairman emphasised the need for a national plan to address the shortfall in liquid milk production. Also, it was recommended that a report detailing this plan be prepared within two weeks. By Dinithi Wijesundara"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

As part of this planned project among the canals and rivers due to be renovated are Thalawathugoda River, Diyawanna Oya, Nagahamulla River, Kimbulawala River and the river situated at Palamthuna Bridge in Pelawatta. Sources from the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing stated that most of the aforementioned rivers and canals had been replete with polluted items and the stench emanating from it had become unbearable for residents. They said to prevent floods in the future, the Ministry, based on instructions from the subject Minister, had decided to renovate the canals, rivers and bridges in the coming months. Ministry sources added that following a survey conducted jointly by the Department of Irrigation and the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation it had come to light that improper drainage systems in place could pave the way for future floods in Colombo and its suburbs. Hence, the Minister stressed the importance of renovating the existing canals, rivers and bridges in Colombo to avert major flooding as well as beautify the metropolis for both local and foreign tourists."

The school had been closed on 4 July due to the presence of five large wasp nests on the third storey of the building as well as atop a tamarind tree situated in the school compound. The school authorities stated that they had decided to close the school indefinitely due to fear of wasp attacks on students following strong gale force winds and wasps being targeted by hawks and pigeons. Though the principal D.M.K.K. Dissanayake had made a written request to officials from the Wildlife Department to take prompt action to remove the wasp nests from the school premises, the appeal had fallen on deaf ears, forcing her to close the school till further notice.

Minister Devananda said this when a delegation from the JVP chaired by former Hambantota District MP Nihal Galappaththi and Chief Secretary of Fisheries Federation led by JVP Ratna Gamage met him at the Fisheries Ministry on 10 July. During the meeting, the delegation led by Galappaththi explained to Minister Devananda about 18 factors that have impacted the fisheries industry while stressing the need to resolve these issues as soon as possible while bringing to the attention of Devananda that they are aware of the economic crisis and the dollar shortage in the country. They also emphasised Minister Devananda of the need to control the increasing fish price and to maintain price stability, so that it remains affordable to ordinary citizens. In response to their plea, Minister Devananda said NARA has been engaging in research activities in this connection and agreed that fish breeding has dropped significantly. Devananda said research is also being conducted to ban the use of buoys in fish breeding sites, adding that he has sought funds from Cabinet to implement this project, but he wasn’t able to obtain funds due to the prevailing economic crisis.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/07/12/nepal-first-south-asian-nation-to-allow-same-sex-marriage/,Nepal first South Asian nation to allow same-sex marriage,Author not found,0,2023-07-11T20:30:00+00:00,"Nepal’s Top Court has ordered the legal registration of same-sex marriages, a first step towards marriage equality for LGBTQ+ people in conservative South Asia. Supreme Court Judge Til Prasad Shrestha ruled marriages of same-sex and non-traditional couples must be registered as “temporary” until lawmakers come up with a new legal framework to uphold such unions permanently. In an interim ruling on 28 June, the Judge ordered Nepal’s Government to set up a separate register of marriages for same-sex couples, whose lawyers say will have the same rights as heterosexual partners. The Court also asked opponents of its landmark order to file their objections within two weeks. The ruling makes Nepal the first country to recognise same-sex marriages in South Asia, where Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives have all opposed same-sex civil unions. In the rest of Asia, only Taiwan has legalised same-sex marriage. The ruling followed a petition submitted by LGBTQ+ activists last month to enforce existing rulings, dating back to 2007, that instructed the Government to amend Nepalese legislation to recognise same-sex marriage for the sake of equal rights. Successive governments have so far failed to change the law. One of the petitioners, Pinky Gurung, a trans woman who heads Nepal’s Blue Diamond Society Gay Rights Group, called the latest verdict historic. “I think it shows that there are people accepting us gradually,” she said. A 2011 census estimated that 1,500 people identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or other diverse sexual or gender identities in Nepal, but activists have claimed the queer community actually consists of 2.5 million Nepalese in the country of 30 million. Maya Gurung, a trans woman who married her partner Surendra Pandey six years ago in a Hindu ceremony that was not officially certified by authorities, said the legal battle wasn’t over. “Now we can finally feel our marriage will be legally secure,” the activist said, adding that she would now seek privileges granted to all married couples. Western diplomats also hailed the ruling, which came during the global Pride month that celebrates LGBTQ+ people and their battle to overcome prejudice. “As we conclude Pride month, we are reminded that the freedom to marry means very little without the freedom to marry the person you love,” said US Ambassador Dean Thompson. “Nepal continues to demonstrate regional leadership in promoting the rights of LBGTIQA+ communities,” said Australian Ambassador Felicity Volk in a separate tweet. But the verdict also angered conservative Nepalese politicians. “Same-sex marriage is against natural law, social norms and culture,” tweeted Kamal Thapa, a former Deputy Prime Minister and an influential politician in overwhelmingly Hindu Nepal. “If same-sex marriage is legalised it will lead to family confusion and social distortion,” he claimed. Sujan Panta, a lawyer who advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, warned that many people “in positions of power” held similar beliefs. “A majority of them still find same-sex marriage to be unnatural, but with this Court order, Nepal took its first step toward legalising same-sex marriage,” he said. In May, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of a same-sex couple who married legally in Germany but struggled to get their union recognised in Nepal. Judges called it a constitutional breach and ordered the Government to act. Nepal has tried to stamp out social discrimination ever since a decade-long Maoist rebellion ended in 2006 and the 239-year-old Hindu monarchy was dismantled two years later. Citizens who identify neither as male nor female are permitted to use a third gender on their passports and other official documents, in line with guidelines against discrimination spelled out in Nepal’s new Constitution approved in 2015. More and more public parades and unofficial weddings are being held in Nepal, though LGBTQ+ people report that discrimination and harassment, including violence, remain commonplace. (RFI)"

He stressed the importance of responsible driving and insisted that it is the driver’s responsibility to ensure safety on the roads. “This responsibility becomes even more crucial for drivers in the public transport sector, as they are entrusted with the lives of many passengers,” he added. SSP Thalduwa said reckless driving should never be excused, as it poses a significant risk to the driver, passengers, and other road users. “By disregarding traffic rules and driving without due care, reckless drivers not only jeopardize their own lives but also put innocent lives at stake. These preventable accidents can lead to premature deaths, causing immense grief and loss for the victims’ families and loved ones. It is essential to appreciate and acknowledge the responsible drivers who prioritize the safety of themselves and others. These individuals play a vital role in fostering a culture of safe driving and reducing accidents. Their efforts contribute to creating a safer environment on the roads, and they deserve recognition for their responsible behaviour. To avoid premature deaths on roads, it is crucial for all drivers to prioritize safety, adhere to traffic regulations, and remain vigilant while driving. By doing so, we can work towards minimizing accidents, saving lives, and creating a safer transportation system for everyone,” he added. By Dinithi Wijesundara"

The educational rights of children in countries such as India, Canada and Japan have been safeguarded as a result of this educational pattern”. “The Ministry of Education is under the Central Government. All schools in our country, with the exception of 399, are governed by the Provincial Ministries of education. The initiative to establish 1,000 national schools was launched in 2001. When the 13th Constitutional Amendment was initiated there were 17 national schools in this country. However, as a result of political initiatives or the requests of individual Education Ministers, there was a dramatic rise in the number of national schools. However, one cannot say that it led to high-quality education. There was a time when 28 national schools were created overnight.  But right now, the education sector has to be transformed. Instead of the exam-centred education system, students should be aligned in a student-centred education pattern”, he further said and added “There was a significant setback in education as a result of Covid-19 and the recent economic downturn. Additionally, socio economic issues made it impossible to run the schools effectively due to fuel and gas concerns. Federation of University Teachers’ Associations (FUTA) and Teacher trade unions did not attend to evaluate the answer sheet of the Advanced Level examination.

The A-Level exams for this year are scheduled to take place in December, according to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education has taken steps to hold all the examinations in the prescribed year”. “The programme to reform education is currently being implemented. Plans are afoot to commence  teaching activities in the English medium in association with the British Council. For this purpose, 13,800 teachers have been trained so far. The updating of textbooks for the  English medium has also commenced. “The addition of Artificial Intelligence and Information Technology to the curriculum is proposed for  Grade 6-9 and Grade 10-13. We are attempting to secure Information Technology assistance for this from companies like Microsoft. About fifty principal vacancies exist. While conducting a competitive examination for the recruitment, a trade union went to Court and got an injunction. For the recruitment of teacher administration services, there are roughly 22,000 openings. Government employees who applied for the position have also gone to Court to explain why they are unable to take the competitive exam. The recruitment process has thus far been delayed as a result. Due to 100 people’s human rights being brought up in Court, 4.2 million students’ human rights have already been violated. As a result, we think Courts will make a ruling on this issue quickly. We are working to continue the ‘13 plus’ education programme presented by the President when he was Prime Minister. A select committee has been set up to expand the education sector and the necessary proposals are currently being prepared. Accordingly, the programme to expand education will be prepared jointly with Non-Governmental Organisations in the future. Arrangements are being made to provide loan facilities to Non-Government Universities as well as to create an environment where they can contribute to the economy. It is intended to establish a training University in Kotagala to train students who choose to go to a plantation in order to safeguard the educational rights of children of estate workers. By substantially bolstering the regulating programme of private and international schools, we are committed to ensuring children’s right to education. With regard to all of these issues, we are working to bring about a change in education from next year,” he further said."

A senior Spokesman for the Health Minister quoting Minister Rambukwella yesterday (10) said the Minister had indicated that an agreement had been reached regarding the submission of a Cabinet Paper in this regard. Minister Rabukwella explained that the agreement had been reached to start a nursing university about a month ago by submitting a Cabinet Paper. He noted that it was important to do a diploma and get a degree. “As the Minister of Foreign Employment, I looked into possibilities of initiating a programme to send nurses to countries like Canada and America,” he said noting that the basic request those countries had been for a nursing degree. In a bid to boost the human resources of the state health service in the island, the Health Ministry award appointment letters for training of 3315 nursing students of the 2020 student nurses batch.

The recruitment of the two batches commenced despite the economic pressure and the political issues of the time. “The students themselves were facing a dilemma and their parents called me and informed of the problem of facing these children,” he explained. The spokesman said that the Ministry had been able to probe these issues and find solutions.  First, was by resolving the problem related to the’ Z score’ within a very short period of two weeks. The examination department was able to solve the problem. “These children did not demonstrate or carryout protest marches but put pressure on us with intelligence. Otherwise we would not have felt the force and the need to act should they have taken to the streets,” he observed. The Minister of Health also pointed out that plans were being made to recruit 2497 students who had completed three years of training as nurses. According to the 2018/2019 high school results, 3315 students qualified for nursing training this year, and a group of nursing students from Colombo district were officially appointed for training at the Health Ministry. Simultaneously with these appointments, the Health Ministry had made arrangements to provide appointments for nursing students in 15 nursing schools across the island.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/07/11/sri-lanka-needs-devils-advocates-not-armchair-national-security-experts/,"Sri Lanka needs devil’s advocates, not armchair national security experts",By Major (retd) Hemantha Dayaratne USP,0,2023-07-10T20:32:00+00:00,"Sri Lanka’s national security thinking is yet to evolve. Armchair national security experts dominate in national security architecture. Needs devil’s advocates for course correction to restore some balance.         Events unfolded in the recent past in national security and have raised a fundamental question. Has Sri Lanka had credible national security experts to advise politicians in power to make right national security decisions to prevent debacles? This is worth exploring for many reasons.        Reportedly, one expert’s advice to former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa on organic farming was about to destroy country’s food security, an essential component in national security. On another occasion, state national security experts to the same head of the state had no objection when he declared open an ‘Agitation Site’ for public to protest at Galle Face, Colombo. Having seriously mistaken with democracy and its enshrined freedom of expression, the ‘vital ground’ to consolidate in disguise and launch an attack to the president, his office and residence was so arranged thanks to ‘expert advice’ or rather a lacuna of advice. Machiavelli famously said, ‘Rivers and men can be controlled but, not trusted’. No expert was there to realise that sooner or later it would be a ‘deliberate ambush site’ or rather a ‘Forming Up Place’ (FUP) for angry mobs to ideally position the head of the state in a Killing Zone. The ambush sprang as planned meticulously. The violent mob smartly and swiftly formed the ‘assault line’ and attacked both targets. See how conventional battlefield terminologies and tactics applicable to counter revolutionary warfare situations, though nowhere is it mentioned as possible the mixing of the two theatres of war and predicting the consequences. Transferring executive power in the event of political fallout to a successor could have been peaceful and safe with no anarchy if the State had real national security experts to advise politicians in power. National security blunders list The ‘national security blunders list’ does not end there. Former president Maithripala Sirisena too made an unforgivable blunder thanks to armchair national security experts. For him there were no threats to the nation after the demise of the LTTE. Armchair national security experts dared not contradict the President’s utopian idea and thus, led to ignore precise intelligence warnings they had received from India. Those debacles are just a few to realise that Sri Lanka has only a bunch of armchair national security experts at public expense in weakly organised entities in the name of national security and strategy. The new President Ranil Wickremesinghe should be aware of this harsh reality.   It is striking to mention about a country that triumphantly ended a 30 year-long very difficult armed conflict a decade ago, is now left with non-professional security experts in the State. In fact, the professional security experts  were made to fade away long ago for a reason. Because they were ‘devil’s advocates’ amongst amiable, incompetent and gullible armchair national security experts who began to dominate in state national security thinking, teaching, academic and policy making institutions in successive governments in the aftermath of war with no expert ability on national security or strategy. Sri Lanka has thus reached a destination where the ‘devil’s advocates’ contribution is mandatory for course correction and to restore some balance in the national security domain. The devil’s advocates are those who pretend, in a discussion or argument, to go against an idea or plan that has a lot of support in the hope of uncovering flaws or mistakes. Therefore, the devil’s advocates’ assessments naturally will contradict the established view. However, it will be  important as they encourage doubt among decision-makers as unilateral or collective thinking by the previous two governments has seriously failed on many occasions as explained. Some countries as a remedy to such anomalous practice ‘the tenth man rule’ which has its origins in the devil’s advocacy. It suggests that, if nine people in a group of ten agree on an issue, the tenth member must take a contradictory viewpoint and assume the other nine are wrong. Politicians chase fame, power and popularity and so, find it difficult to make right national security choices by themselves. Then they look for experts around them and there, it is only the armchair national security experts are available with not an iota of practical knowledge or experience on national security. Strategies they have learned from books are impressive but often not practical in the local context. More to add, strategy if repeated is not a strategy. Therefore, they are cherry picking; only to go with the popular argument or view that they desire or their superior wishes to have in them. Their research publications are full of red herrings, distracting from real national security issues in the country. No alternative thinking, just book reading outcomes. So, they have been only good at ‘national security autopsies’. Further, if carefully considered, it is notable that these armchair national security experts are simply satisfying big power interests over state national security interests knowingly or unknowingly. Then, who can perform the role of the devil’s advocate? It can surely be veterans and former foreign service officers. Sri Lanka’s foreign service has been historically-highly politicised. However, there are a few retired professionals remaining. They have proved their mettle in advancing public diplomacy, politics, peace, economics and security in the past in the best interest of the State. Academically qualified soldiers Veterans are professionally and academically qualified soldiers or officers who have served in real battlefields, realised the multi-faceted nature of war, peace and conflict, and were honourably discharged under certain circumstances. Most Sri Lankan Armed Forces veterans who battled in the war are now retired but, they can still play important roles in Sri Lanka’s national security accredited to their education, experience and knowledge as experts. Their experience and knowledge on conflict can be incorporated effectively into national security teaching, thinking and policy making in the country.  A few hand-picked men from the above two professional categories, being the devil’s advocate could improve strategic national security decision-making if certain conditions are met. Such conditions include avoid becoming an overly negative ‘carping critic’, meaning delivering deliberately unreasonable criticism, have a deep and sincere commitment to questioning the basic assumptions of the majority, objectively. Had some kind of the ‘devil’s advocate’ on national security and strategy purposefully doubted the two previous Presidents’ and their armchair national security experts’ opinion, both the devastating Easter attacks and the Galle face fiasco could have been easily managed without endangering the country and the people. Unfortunately, the ‘devil’s advocates’ usually find it hard to survive among armchair national security experts owing to the harsh reality that politicians are more comfortable with the latter than the former. Whatever the national security decision that ruling politicians take, it is unlikely to matter to them as none seems answerable to national security blunders at the end, in this fragile state. This is another reason for politicians’ apathy to the ‘devil’s advocates’.  Sagala Ratnayake has been appointed as  Senior National Security Advisor (NSA). This new State appointment is timely and important, but the appointee does not stem from any national security background. In this context, serving military officers’ capacity to play the ‘devil’s advocate’ role is limited for obvious reasons of military discipline and their expressed loyalty to the Government in power. In such a setting, the NSA must have ‘devil’s advocates’ in his office to better advise the President and the Government to satisfy national security interests of the nation. National security is too dangerous to be left only in the hands of armchair national security experts.    (The writer, formerly an infantry officer in the Sri Lanka Army, Fellow Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis, New Delhi and founding Research Officer and Lecturer, Department of Strategic Studies, KDU and international media officer to President’s media division.

Prof. Marasinghe said,  “Today Sri Lanka has been able to process foreign loans as well as local loans as the local Credit Optimisation Bill to create sovereign debt sustainability was passed with a majority in Parliament”. During a media briefing at Sirikotha, Prof. Marasinghe said countries and financial agencies which gave loans to Sri Lanka, have agreed to write off a total sum of USD 17 billion and to extend the period of settling dues to 15 years and that passing the Bill was the reason. He said the request of international creditors was if USD 17 billion ought to be reduced from what Sri Lanka has obtained, domestic credit must be restructured in some way adding that accordingly, Sri Lanka has been able to extend the repayment of domestic loans of US$ 2 billion to 15 years.  “The bankrupt Opposition continues to make absurd allegations and was misinterpreting it as a move to destroy the Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund. They also predicted that the Bank system was drifting into a dangerous state, a situation that has never happened ever before in the financial history of Sri Lanka. “They said the share market would collapse as a result. Due to the continuous government holidays it was able to carry out this process very independently and freely,” said Prof. Marasinghe. On certain occasions, if depositors had withdrawn their money from Banks believing these rumours, there was a possibility of the banking system of this country collapsing, Prof Marasinghe further said.

After the 13 March 2023 auction, CBSL stopped issuing T-Bonds till is domestic debt restructuring (DDR) matter was sorted out which took place on 1 July, with Parliament passing the necessary laws on that day. Issuing of T-Bonds is a key way that the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) meets its long term (over one year) borrowing needs.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Rasamanickam expressed confidence that if these resources were properly utilised, the North and East could quickly become developed regions. He also highlighted that the lack of power has hindered the development of these provinces. However, he expressed optimism that President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is concerned about every citizen, will soon recommend sustainable solutions for the fundamental rights and development-related issues of the Tamil people. He said this during a media interaction following a workshop organised by the T20 Organisation in Meghalaya, India. The workshop aimed to foster understanding among stakeholders regarding climate and social changes, potential environmental impacts, and the achievement of sustainable development by addressing various challenges. During the discussions, it was stressed that climate change and other environmental issues would significantly impact future generations. MP Rasamanickam emphasised the importance of involving youth in facing and overcoming these challenges. Rasamanickam said Meghalaya, established in the early 1970s, has successfully transformed itself into a developed region by harnessing its resources. He said the North and East could achieve sustainable and steady development within a short period if they were granted the necessary power through proper devolution. Further, Rasamanickam emphasised that although the provinces possess sufficient resources to drive development, the main obstacle lies in the lack of rights and power to implement their development plans as desired. He specifically mentioned the issue of illegal sand mining occurring in both provinces. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

Jacob, addressing the inauguration ceremony of the Construction, Power and Energy Expo 2023 in Colombo on 7 July, said the occasion testifies to the robust economic and commercial links between India and Sri Lanka. Following is the full speech: “I am particularly encouraged by the enthusiastic participation of Indian companies in this Expo, which by the latest count amounts to nearly 50. This testifies to the robust economic and commercial links between India and Sri Lanka. The past three years have demonstrated the close links between the people of India and Sri Lanka. In line with the Neighbourhood First Policy of the Government of India, the Indian High Commission has steadfastly supported the economic and social ministries of Sri Lanka as they navigated the challenges of the Covid pandemic, the economic crisis and the political upheavals during this period. India’s financial and humanitarian support worth USD 4 billion is far in excess of the total anticipated Extended Fund Facility of the IMF. We were the first creditor nation in January this year to convey the financing assurances needed to kick-start the IMF process. India will continue to play a constructive role as a Co-Chair of the Creditors Committee along with Japan and the Paris Club. The successful visit of External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar to Sri Lanka in January this year opened up avenues for further cooperation through investment in infrastructure, manufacturing and promoting connectivity. India was Sri Lanka’s largest trading partner in 2022. Sri Lanka’s exports to India have also grown. The use of Rupees for trade settlement is further helping Sri Lanka’s economy. These are concrete steps to help Sri Lanka’s economic recovery and growth. I am glad to note that India was once again the largest source of tourists for Sri Lanka last year with over 100,000 tourists and is continuing to top the chart so to say this year as well. Around one in every five to six tourists in Sri Lanka is an Indian. The resumption of Chennai-Jaffna flights is yet another step in bringing the people of the two countries closer. Ferry services between the two countries will bolster this further. Connectivity is a force multiplier in this context. This will complement the flagship development cooperation partnership which has given such useful public goods like the Suwa Seriya 1990 Ambulance Service, the Indian Housing Project, the reconstruction of schools and construction of hospitals and other socioeconomic projects. Recent developments in India-Sri Lanka ties have strengthened our friendship and all-round cooperation. At the same time, the two countries also remain vigilant to address common challenges, especially in the maritime security domain. I hope the participants in the Expo will keep this background in mind and strive to further deepen the India-Sri Lanka friendship which is currently at its highest point in the past 75 years. We have reached this stage because the people, the business circles and the Government of India have resolved to strongly stand by Sri Lanka at the current juncture.”"

Sri Lanka was hit by a catastrophic financial crisis in 2022, the worst since its independence from Britain in 1948, due to a severe paucity of foreign exchange reserves. As the country struggled, locked in the throes of the crisis, India extended multi-pronged assistance of about USD 4 billion to it last year, through multiple credit lines and currency support, in line with India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy. In his address at the gala dinner reception hosted for delegates of the Indian Travel Congress on Friday, Abeywardena said India “saved us” during the financial crisis, otherwise, there would have been “another bloodbath for all of us”. At the evening reception, he thanked India for the help extended to the cash-strapped nation and recalled the civilisational ties and similarities between the two countries and their cultures. “Sri Lanka and India are very, very closely interconnected countries, culturally, nationally, and policy-wise, and above all, India has been a very close associate and trustworthy friend of Sri Lanka,” Abeywardena said, adding that when “we were in trouble”, India always helped out. “And, even this time, today, I heard that India is willing to extend our restructuring of loans for 12 years. Never expected, and never in history, not a single country has extended that kind of assistance,” he said. He recalled the helping hand lent by India during the period of trouble last year that devastated the Sri Lankan economy, pushing it into a debt crisis. “I must tell you, during the trouble that we had last year, you (India) saved us, India saved us otherwise, there would have been another bloodbath for all of us. So, that is how India came to help us,” Abeywardena said. He said this in the presence of Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Gopal Baglay, Tourism and Lands Minister Harin Fernando, and other senior officials of the Sri Lankan Government. “Your ambassador here, (is a) very close friend of ours. We love and respect him,” the Speaker said, referring to Baglay. Later, in an interaction with PTI on the sidelines of the reception, Abeywardena said, “India has always come to the aid of Sri Lanka” in times of crises, and laid emphasis on the financial assistance given by New Delhi last year when the island nation was mired in the economic turmoil. “That helped us survive for six months in the midst of the crisis,” he said. “We thank India for the kind gesture, and I also say, thank you, Prime Minister of India (Narendra Modi),” he told PTI. Noting the similarity between the Indian surname Singh and the Sri Lankan surname Singhe, Abeywardena said, “It shows we are genetically connected to India”. “That way, India is not a new country to us. It’s part of the ethos of our country, part of our life, part of our heart,” he said, adding, “We are here to receive you, respect you, join with you.” “Together, we (Sri Lanka) can join with you (India), without any difficulty or hesitation, with great trust,” the Speaker said. In his address, Tourism and Lands Minister Fernando pitched Sri Lanka – Pearl of the Indian Ocean – as a unique destination for India and the rest of the world, saying, “One island nation offers so many different tourist experiences, without travelling far from one location to another.” Meanwhile, several sessions were held on Saturday as part of the three-day 67th Convention of the TAAI (Travel Agents Association of India) which began on 6 July. The four-day convention of the TAAI, which was set up in 1951, is being held with the support of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) and the Sri Lankan Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO).

Herath said people are interested in the production and consumption of liquid milk, and by supporting the liquid milk business it has been feasible to boost the dairy farmers’ economics and satisfy the country’s need for protein. The Minister also mentioned that the Government has implemented a specific programme to promote liquid milk production in the country. He expressed these views during a media briefing themed ‘Collective Path to a Stable Country’ held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (7). “In the past, the Ministry of Agriculture had to face many problems. In the face of that crisis, the President started a strong programme to meet the food needs of the people of the country. The Ministry of Agriculture faced numerous issues in the past. The President launched a robust effort to meet the food needs of the people of the country in response to that disaster. Our goal in the livestock sector is to primarily supply the nation’s protein and dairy needs. Medical guidelines state that one individual requires 100 ml of milk every day. As a result, the nation should produce 750 million ml of milk per day,” he said. In 2021, we could not achieve those goals. We could produce only 712 million litres of milk. We had to import the rest from foreign countries. The Government has spent Rs 58 billion for that. This is a serious challenge for us economically, he added. The minister said to date, Customs concessions have been provided to import animal feed and medicine. The possibility to import mother cows has also been made available. We plan to reduce costs by doing this. “We anticipate charging the consumer a fair price for these products. Restarting industry-related enterprises that have failed is one of our key objectives. Making the nation milk self-sufficient is our goal. Despite the difficulty, we have commenced the required programme for that. We currently have only 16,000 cows in this programme. Additionally, there are 400,000 buffaloes. Currently, the Central and North-West Provinces make significant contributions to milk production. The majority of animals are raised solely for meat in the Eastern and Southern Provinces. Also, we are currently implementing a programme to provide the knowledge related to the subject to other farmers in that field, including the small-scale farmers who represent the livestock sector, thereby increasing the production capacity.”"

The government should implement a programme that includes other nutritious foods, such as eggs, sprats and a variety of grains rich in nutrition. This will help support the growth of the children until Thriposha production is restored,” Kodithuwakku emphasised. She further explained that pregnant and breast-feeding mothers could incorporate the provided products into the daily meals of their children, which would help maintain their nutrition levels.

The Monetary Board of the CBSL, at a meeting held on 5 July, decided to reduce the SDFR and the Standing Lending Facility Rate SLFR of the CBSL by 200 basis points to 11 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively. CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said banks will be given a time to adjust the new interest rates according to their requirements. However, if they fail to do so, actions will be taken against such banks, he added. CBSL, in a statement said further relaxing the Facility Standing Deposit Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) the Monetary Board said that the banking sector is expected to pass down the benefits to the public immediately and that action would be taken if the progress was sluggish. CBSL said, that the Monetary Board arrived at this decision following a careful analysis of the current and expected developments, including the faster-than-envisaged disinflation process and benign inflation expectations in the domestic economy, with the aim of enabling the economy to reach its potential and stabilising inflation at mid-single digit levels in the medium term, while easing pressures in the financial markets. The Monetary Board expects that, with this reduction of policy interest rates by 200 bps, and the reduction of policy interest rates by 250 bps in early June 2023, along with the significant reduction of risk premia on government securities witnessed recently, the market interest rates, particularly lending rates, will adjust downwards adequately and swiftly. According to CBSL, the successive reduction in the policy interest rates will provide the impetus for market interest rates to adjust downwards in line with the faster moderation of inflation, so that monetary conditions remain accommodative. “The Monetary Board expects the banking and financial sector to pass on the benefits of the reduction of policy interest rates thus far and the reduction of interest rate risk premia to businesses and individuals without delay. “However, if the pass-through of such developments is deemed to be inadequate and sluggish, the Central Bank will consider taking appropriate administrative measures to ensure the timely and adequate pass-through of accommodative monetary policy,” CBSL said.

AHP President Ravi Kumudesh, who spoke to the media yesterday (6), alleged it should be probed whether the death was caused due to brand ‘Propofol’ an intravenous anaesthetic, which had been the particular brand which had allegedly led to the death of a child at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Specialised Children’s Hospital, Peradeniya. However, the Health Ministry had taken urgent measures to clear the drug and negate the claims, Kumudesh stressed. The AHP President said, H.G. Himali Priyadarshini Weerasinghe, a 35-year-old mother of two, from Kosgoda Boralukatiya South, died following eye surgery at the National Eye Hospital, Colombo (NEH). The deceased had previously undergone surgical intervention to insert a lens in her eye at the NEH, Colombo, but due to an allergic reaction in the eye, which had been operated, she had been admitted to the hospital on the same day for a second surgery, which had been carried out on Wednesday (5). However, Himali had died following the surgery without even regaining conscious, he said.  Kumudesh noted that the relatives of the dead woman’s family suspected that she died due to the anaesthetic drug that had been administered to her. Despite being repeatedly told that the particular brand of Anaesthetic had caused the death of the child at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Children’s Hospital in Peradeniya, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) held a press conference and dismissed the claims publicly denying the allegations. The Health Minister even stated in the Parliament that the death was not a result of the particular brand of anaesthesia drug, he said. “We strongly believe that had the health authorities been sensitive and not haughtily waived off the complaints the second death could have been prevented,” he lamented. Furthermore, Kumudesh said the AHP would meet with the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) and inquire into possibilities of resolving the injustice of the current medicinal drug issue through public welfare litigation. Kumudesh said his outfit had arranged to forward all the related articles through email. “Since we do not have a thorough knowledge of the law, we hope to meet with the BASL and look into possibilities of seeking justice with regard to the poor quality drugs which had led to death and blindness in patients,” Kumudesh said.  He said his outfit had informed the , parallel to the request made to the President and the Minister of Health on 2 July, regarding the incident at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Children’s Hospital, Peradeniya. He urged the public, to seek assistance from the Sri Lanka Medical Council, the Director General Health Services or inform the nearest Police station whenever they had doubts, in order to work actively for an improved State health service. “There is no necessity to get alarmed by reports regarding the death of patients following surgery and treatment. The AHP has been repeatedly been calling for the immediate establishment of a specific committee or team to set up a specific mechanism to investigate harm caused by medicinal drugs and medical professional practices, to prevent the recurrence of this situation, Kumudesh said.  It is the responsibility of the Health Minister, his Ministry and the government to at least form a special committee for that purpose.  The health service has become a serious danger to the public as a result of it paving the way for the importation of low quality medicines, he added.

The Judge stated that he was handing down the death sentence on the accused, as the prosecution had proved its charges beyond all reasonable doubt. The Senior State Counsel, who prosecuted on behalf of the Attorney General, urged Judge Balalle to impose the maximum possible punishment on the accused, so as to deter others from turning Sri Lanka, into a safe haven for narcotic smuggling. He added that such a stringent punishment could give a clear message to illegal drug peddlers, that it is difficult to turn Sri Lanka into a paradise for illegal drug peddling and that those found guilty of such offences, will not be let off lightly.

During parliamentary sittings, Premadasa raised his concerns to the Minister of Agriculture, highlighting that USD 6.9 million was spent on organic fertilisers imported from China, which amounts to Rs 1.38 billion. He stressed that the government has been unable to recover this sum, as compensation for the distribution of substandard fertilisers in that deal. Referring to an audit report, Premadasa said, the responsible individuals within the State and Cabinet Minister of Agriculture were negligent in their duties, resulting in the failure to retrieve the money. He said, the government must take immediate action or table the Auditor General’s report, which has reportedly concluded the investigation into the ‘Nano Nitrogen Fertiliser fraud’ as well. Premadasa also addressed concerns regarding the purchase of paddy, citing discrepancies in prices across different areas. He said, although the President had promised a guaranteed price of Rs 100 per kilo of paddy, the reality is different.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Judge said that the Petition concerned, had been submitted to him by a third party and explained that the Petitioner, has not been named as a suspect, in the on-going probe. Judge Nissanka also added that as per the law, the Magistrate’s Court has the authority to issue directives to the CID or the Police, to investigate whatever complaint that is lodged with it. Hence, he noted that as the Petitioner has neither been named as a suspect nor even been arrested in connection with the incident and as there was no legality to the Petition, he was dismissing it then and there. Jayawardhana filed the petition following the order of Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage, to the CID, probe whether Jayawardhana and several others had committed the offence of Contempt of Court during a press conference held after the arrest of comedian Nathasha Edirisooriya. Through the petition, Jayawardhana said, a Magistrate’s Court has no power to investigate Contempt of Court cases. Also, he said the said press conference was held in Maradana Police Division, which belongs to the Maligakanda Judicial Zone, hence the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court does not have the power to investigate the case.

Following Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena’s announcement about the appointment of the PSC, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa along with Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella, demanded that the chairmanship of the Select Committee be granted to the Opposition. MPs Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Prof. Ranjith Bandara, Eran Wickramaratne, Vijitha Herath, Major Pradeep Undugoda, Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, D.V. Chanaka, Mahindananda Aluthgmage, Jayantha Ketagoda, Harshana Rajakaruna, Sanjeewa Edirimanne, and Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda were announced as the PSC members. Premadasa and Kiriella alleged that the country’s insolvency was a direct result of the massive tax concessions, valued at Rs 700 billion, granted by the current government. Consequently, they deemed it inappropriate to appoint a member of the ruling party as the committee chair and requested the appointment of an Opposition MP instead. In response, Minister Bandula Gunawardena pointed out that several previous governments were also responsible for the economic crisis. He highlighted a legislation enacted years ago stipulating that the budget deficit should be reduced to five per cent of GDP and public debt should amount to 65 per cent of the GDP by 2006. “None of the governments in power during that period had fulfilled these requirements. Therefore, the current SLPP government should not bear sole responsibility for the economic crisis,” he said. Minister Ali Sabry further defended the ruling party, claiming that the previous Good-Governance Government, in 2015, mismanaged the economy and significantly decreased the economic growth, which stood at seven per cent. He emphasised that the SLPP government cannot be solely blamed for the crisis. Opposition MPs Weerasumana Weerasinghe and Mohomad Muzammil, who interjected, asserted that the composition of the Select Committee should reflect the new composition of the House Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said, when the PSC to probe the Easter Sunday terror attacks in 2019 was formed, the then government members, who are now in Opposition held posts in that PSC BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

Speaking in Parliament, Dissanayake stated that laws such as the Public Property Act, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Bribery or Corruption Act, and the Criminal Procedure Act provide ample provisions to prosecute individuals involved in economic crimes. The judicial system primarily targets ordinary citizens engaged in minor offenses, while those involved in serious offenses often escape punishment due to their political influence, he stressed.

Accordingly, BOC has structured a range of special programmes to reach these target groups and a number of programmes have already been implemented successfully.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Speaking in Parliament, Dissanayake stated that laws such as the Public Property Act, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Bribery or Corruption Act, and the Criminal Procedure Act provide ample provisions to prosecute individuals involved in economic crimes. The judicial system primarily targets ordinary citizens engaged in minor offenses, while those involved in serious offenses often escape punishment due to their political influence, he stressed. He pointed out an example where someone was apprehended for stealing coconuts, while a Police constable and a Grama Niladhari who accepted bribes were held accountable. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

TISL, in a statement, alleged that the Bill is ‘anti-democratic’ and added that it believes that this move would be a heavy blow to the people’s sovereignty enshrined in the Constitution. “Local Government Members are the grass-roots level public representatives. Regular elections are essential for the people’s mandate to be reflected in the Local Government bodies. In addition, this Amendment sets a bad precedent as it creates a risk of abusing the legal framework to prevent holding timely elections, including national elections. This can lead to the people losing faith in the entire democratic system in the country, with negative implications to the rule of law as well. Therefore, TISL emphasises that any attempt to pass this Amendment must be roundly defeated.

President Wickremesinghe held constructive discussions with various donor groups in Paris, France and Great Britain, seeking their support to rescue the country from its financial crisis and achieve sustainable development goals. Addressing the media at Sirikotha, Abeywardena mentioned that many individuals have started to repay their debts as a result. Abeywardena expressed confidence that by the end of September, Sri Lanka can significantly address its financial challenges and uplift the people’s well-being. Furthermore, the World Bank has announced its readiness to provide a total of USD 700 million as part of its on-going assistance programme to Sri Lanka. According to Abeywardena, these positive outcomes have been made possible through the consultation and financial restructuring carried out with the assistance of renowned agencies like Lazard, aiming to make Sri Lanka a strong country. He highlighted that parliamentary approval was obtained, considering the future of over 22 million people in the country. Abeywardena stated that making deposits in banks can save approximately Rs 57 million, and restructuring the domestic debt can contribute 50% of income to the treasury while advancing the local economy. He also emphasised that President Wickremesinghe has taken necessary steps to protect depositors of private banks. MP Abeywardena expressed concern about the Opposition and certain factions’ attitude during the government’s efforts to secure parliamentary approval. Furthermore, he mentioned that Sri Lanka has improved its standing in the global corruption index, now ranked 101 out of 180 countries, demonstrating the country’s gradual progress towards becoming corruption-free.

According to the Minister, out of a total of 29,723 cases, a distressing 5,550 pertain to child abuse, while an alarming 4,312 are rape cases. The Minister stressed, “As Sri Lankans, we must confront this disheartening reality head-on and express genuine remorse for our collective failure. These abhorrent statistics not only tarnish our reputation, but also expose the disturbing aspects of our societal culture. Urgent and decisive action is imperative to combat these despicable acts.” Acknowledging the gravity of the situation, the Minister highlighted the implementation of stringent laws aimed at safeguarding the welfare of children. Over the past ten months, Parliament has enacted an impressive total of 25 laws in this regard. “Nevertheless, with cases of murder, attempted murder and dangerous drugs accounting for 6,661 of the overall caseload, constituting 22 per cent, it is evident that our challenges extend beyond child abuse and rape,” he added. “Furthermore, a staggering 55 per cent of the total cases, currently before the Magistrate’s Courts, involve child abuses, rape, murder, attempted murder, or dangerous drugs. These numbers paint a distressing picture of the widespread injustices plaguing our society,” he said. The Minister also drew attention to the immense backlog of cases within Sri Lanka’s judicial system, with a staggering 1,127,265 cases pending. It is deeply concerning that there are only 399 judges available, ranging from the Supreme Court to the Magistrate’s Courts, to address this overwhelming caseload, he pointed out.

During a media briefing at Sirikotha, Rangebandara mentioned that when efforts were made to provide permanent land deeds to individuals after demarcation, some individuals misinterpreted it as an attempt to divide the country into separate North and South zones. He criticised these elements for creating a fictitious narrative, suggesting that visas would be required to travel between the South and North of the country. Rangebandara further stated that false propaganda was carried out against the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) agreement, which led the people to work against the Government and ultimately topple it without understanding the truth and the benefits Sri Lanka could have gained from it. As a result, many people continue to live without land ownership. He also highlighted that similar propaganda was being spread against seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to rescue the country from its financial crisis. He alleged that certain factions criticised every effort made to improve the country’s economy with international support, only to change their stance when the international community started viewing Sri Lanka positively. He expressed concern that the Government’s actions are being criticised and allegations are being made, particularly targeting ordinary citizens. Rangebandara mentioned the protests against the ‘Aswesuma’ welfare programme, claiming that they misguide ordinary people who are unaware of the programmes truth and the benefits it offers.

This was after a petition, filed on her behalf, was taken up before the Judge, last afternoon. Judge Patabendige, elaborating on his decision to grant bail to the accused, stated that the latter had informed Court that she was willing to seek public forgiveness from any group or section of society, over her remarks, if it had hurt them. The Judge said the accused had also conveyed to Court, that she was feeling highly remorseful over her remarks and that as the Attorney General, had also not expressed any objection to her being enlarged on bail, it was being granted. Accordingly, the Judge instructed the Court Registrar, to convey his decision on granting bail to the accused, to the relevant Magistrate’s Court. Judge Patabendige further stressed that it was rather questionable, whether the remarks attributed to have been made by the stand-up comedian, would have caused public riots here. He pointed out that the society too had been unaware of the incident, till the remarks made by the accused had been posted online and on various social media platforms. He observed that sufficient submissions had not been produced in Court, to suggest that Edirisooriya’s comments could have prompted violent incidents in the country. The Judge added that under such circumstances, the arrest of the accused has to be considered under Provisions contained in the Penal Code. He opined that it has also to be considered, whether just because any powerful individual in society lodges a complaint, a suspect could be apprehended willy-nilly, as per Provisions of the ICCPR. President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared on behalf of the accused comedian, while Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) Dileepa Peiris represented the Attorney General.

The Speaker deemed Premadasa’s presence at the COPF meeting inappropriate. In defence of his actions, Premadasa explained that he attended the COPF meeting to question relevant State officials about the impact of domestic debt restructuring on the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF). He expressed his frustration at not having the opportunity to question the officials directly and stated that he would summon all government officials from now on.

Commenting on a call from a senior monk in Sri Lanka for Bangkok to return the elephant once he fully recovers, Varawut said the matter is not even open for discussion. “Sak Surin is now under the patronage of the King, so that is out of the question,” Varawut said. Sak Surin is currently in quarantine for 30 days, at the elephant conservation centre in the Hang Chat District of Lampang Province. The elephant seems to be in a good mood, shaking his head and enjoying his food. After the quarantine period, vets will conduct more thorough checks on him. Initial examinations show that SakSurin is suffering from a cataract in the right eye, it cannot bend its front left leg, he has infected wounds on his hips and has problems with his nails and the soles of all four feet. Varawut also mentioned two other Thai elephants donated to Sri Lanka, Sri Narong and Pratupa, which remain there. He said it seems that Sri Lanka is capable of taking care of them and they are apparently in good health, although one of has suffered minor injuries. Some universities in Sri Lanka have contacted the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer to take care of the Thai elephants, claiming they have the capabilities to do so.(Thai PBS)"

During a media briefing at Sirikotha, Rangebandara mentioned that when efforts were made to provide permanent land deeds to individuals after demarcation, some individuals misinterpreted it as an attempt to divide the country into separate North and South zones. He criticised these elements for creating a fictitious narrative, suggesting that visas would be required to travel between the South and North of the country. Rangebandara further stated that false propaganda was carried out against the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) agreement, which led the people to work against the Government and ultimately topple it without understanding the truth and the benefits Sri Lanka could have gained from it. As a result, many people continue to live without land ownership. He also highlighted that similar propaganda was being spread against seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to rescue the country from its financial crisis. He alleged that certain factions criticised every effort made to improve the country’s economy with international support, only to change their stance when the international community started viewing Sri Lanka positively. He expressed concern that the Government’s actions are being criticised and allegations are being made, particularly targeting ordinary citizens. Rangebandara mentioned the protests against the ‘Aswesuma’ welfare programme, claiming that they misguide ordinary people who are unaware of the programmes truth and the benefits it offers. He added that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has advised District Secretaries nationwide to be cautious when selecting beneficiary families for the welfare programme, ensuring that all suitable families are included without marginalisation.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/07/06/the-learning-crisis-and-the-way-forward/,The learning crisis and the way forward,Author not found,0,2023-07-05T20:32:00+00:00,"Addressing the International Donor Agencies Workshop, held yesterday (5), Education Minister Susil Premajayantha spoke at length on the learning crisis and the way forward for Sri Lanka’s primary education sector. Following is the full speech. I like to thank the UNICEF Sri Lanka for taking initiative to organise this workshop of international donor agencies to discuss the way forward in primary education in Sri Lanka. As in many other countries, the Covid-9 period resulted in many serious problems in our school system, mainly the primary education section. This workshop will examine the issues involved and what priorities must be considered in charting the way forward. Children, who represent 30 per cent of Sri Lanka’s total population, are disproportionately impacted by humanitarian crises and require special care and attention. Children face the risk of separation from their families, or may not be able to access critical services such as health, nutrition, water, sanitation, education and protection. In areas with existing vulnerabilities such as poverty, young people are even more vulnerable to chronic malnutrition, food insecurity, child labour, trafficking and exploitation, and they may drop out of school at increased rates. Furthermore children and young people are now part of a generation that will have to deal with increasingly adverse, climate change-related events. UNICEF coordinates, strengthens and execute response plans in the face of such crises through early warning mechanisms, emergency operations and development planning in coordination with the Government of Sri Lanka and key ministries. While Sri Lanka has made significant progress in primary education, there are still some gaps and challenges that need to be addressed. Here are some key gaps in the primary education sector of Sri Lanka: Quality of Education: Despite high enrollment rates, ensuring quality education remains a challenge. There is a need to focus on improving teaching methodologies, instructional materials, and teacher training to enhance the overall quality of education in primary schools. Learning Outcomes: There is a need to closely monitor and address gaps in learning outcomes. While enrollment rates are high, ensuring that students acquire the necessary knowledge and skills at the primary level is crucial. Efforts should be made to improve learning outcomes, especially in areas such as literacy, numeracy, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Regional Disparities: There are regional disparities in access to quality education, with some areas, particularly in rural and remote regions, having limited educational resources and infrastructure. Addressing these disparities and ensuring equitable access to quality education across all regions of Sri Lanka is essential. Infrastructure and Facilities: Some primary schools in Sri Lanka face challenges related to inadequate infrastructure, lack of proper sanitation facilities, and insufficient learning resources. Investing in improving school infrastructure and providing necessary facilities can contribute to creating a conducive learning environment for students. Teacher Shortage and Quality: Ensuring an adequate number of qualified and motivated teachers is crucial for the success of primary education. Sri Lanka has faced challenges related to teacher shortages, particularly in rural areas. Recruitment, retention, and professional development of teachers are important areas that need attention to enhance the quality of education. Inclusive Education: Addressing the needs of students with disabilities and promoting inclusive education is another important area for improvement. Providing support services, specialised training for teachers, and accessible learning materials can help ensure that all children, including those with disabilities, have equal opportunities to access quality education. Parental Engagement: Enhancing parental engagement in primary education is essential for improving student outcomes. Encouraging parents’ active involvement in their children’s education, promoting parent-teacher collaboration, and providing resources and guidance to parents can positively impact student learning and overall educational outcomes. Early Childhood Education: Expanding access to quality early childhood education is crucial for setting a strong foundation for primary education. Focusing on the early years can help improve school readiness and better prepare children for primary education. Addressing these gaps requires concerted efforts from policymakers, educators, parents, and the community. It involves investing in infrastructure, improving teacher quality, curriculum development, and implementing effective monitoring and evaluation systems to ensure progress and bridge the gaps in the primary education sector of Sri Lanka. I am very pleased that you have taken a keen interest in understanding these issues and showing commitment to finding solutions to them. I am looking forward to working with you all. Thank You.

When inquired from Nissanka Wijewardena, the Director of Nuwara Eliya Regional Health Services, about the closure of the dental unit at the Dickoya Base Hospital, he said two doctors who worked in the dental unit had gone overseas.

The Minister, speaking to the media at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), said after the arrival of their ship in Sri Lanka, fuel distribution will be initially carried out under the CEYPETCO brand, until they set up their own fuel stations. “After the arrival of their ship in Sri Lanka, fuel distribution will be initially carried out under the name of CEYPETCO. However, future distribution will take place under their own company name,” Wijesekera said. Wijesekera revealed that the Ministry of Finance has imposed a tax of Rs 50 per litre of fuel supplied by the new companies and that revenue would be utilised to pay off the debts of Indian and Iranian fuel suppliers.

During a media briefing yesterday (4), Gammanpila said their scrutiny of the Cabinet Memorandum on domestic debt optimisation, along with the Central Bank’s (CBSL) presentation to the Cabinet, revealed that the Government’s claims were false. According to the Cabinet Memorandum dated 28 June 2023, presented by the Minister of Finance, the outstanding value of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) is USD 886 million or Rs 272 billion. The CBSL presentation indicated a capital reduction, also known as a haircut, of 30 per cent on SLDBs, amounting to Rs 81.6 billion. Gammanpila highlighted that domestic banks hold 85 per cent of the SLDBs, resulting in a loss of Rs 69 billion due to the haircut. Additionally, a 30 per cent haircut is applicable to Foreign Currency Banking Unit (FCBU) loans, which amount to USD 323 million or Rs 92 billion. This translates to a loss of Rs 28 billion. Therefore, the alleged total loss from both SLDBs and FCBU loans amounts to Rs 97 billion, he claimed. Furthermore, Gammanpila stressed that there will be an approximate 35 per cent reduction in interest rates as part of the DDR. Although they have not calculated the specific loss associated with this interest rate reduction, he believes it will have an adverse impact on commercial banks’ liquidity and profitability during the DDR process, Gammanpila added.

Bandara said, “The entire country agrees that the present 225 members in Parliament lack a mandate. We also view this as a violation of the mandate. Wickremesinghe needs the SJB to remain as President. He is a shrewd politician. He is only offering us assistance to achieve his own objectives.” Bandara further demanded that President Wickremesinghe terminate what he referred to as his “deal” with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and dissolve Parliament. President Wickremesinghe on Monday (3) reiterated his previous invitation to the SJB, led by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, urging them to prioritise the national interest over politics and join efforts to resolve public issues. Wickremesinghe suggested that the SJB could remain in the Opposition and support his Administration’s recovery and reform agenda through the parliamentary committee system. He also expressed disappointment with the SJB for what he implied was a politically motivated attack on Sri Lanka’s domestic debt restructuring plan. In response to the President’s statement, Bandara stressed, “If you genuinely want to assist us, dissolve Parliament immediately. That would be a favour to us and the country. Then you can continue to govern with a new team for a while longer.” He also mentioned that the SJB would consider Wickremesinghe’s offer to “help him” once Parliament has been dissolved, noting that the President has had the legal authority to dissolve Parliament since March 2023.

MCPA President Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa yesterday (4) said the SPC should pay attention to all these matters and remove its Chairman while initiating an investigation against him. He called for an investigation against the Chairman of the SPC for continuing to hold the position even after being found guilty by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE). Dr. Sanjeewa claimed that the State health service has been the subject of discussion following the appointment of a person, who the Public Accounts Committee held unfit to hold such an esteemed post in the public service, after the incumbent President came to power. The Civil Activists accused the incumbent Health Minister and Health Secretary of being responsible for the greatest collapse of the health system in the history of Sri Lanka, while calling for their immediate removal followed by the system’s urgent   reorganisation. The MCPA in collaboration with other the civil organisations, including the National Anti-Corruption Movement (NACM) lodged the complaint. Leader of the NACM Jamuni Kamanta lamented that it was most unfortunate that the political machinery of the country was maintaining a very lax attitude regarding the misuse of the taxpayers’ money through continuous corruption and irregularities in the government and semi government services. If emergency drug purchasingis required, it should be done in a transparent manner, subject to the recommendations of the expert committee and not based on the needs of the Health Minister or the Secretary’s Additional Secretaries, he lashed out noting that this continuous emergency purchasing of medicinal drugs by the Health Ministry was a colossal problem.

Addressing a media briefing at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), the Minister said, granting salary increments and bonuses to the employees of these two entities has been suspended as it is not possible to provide such perks at the loss-making entities. “As a result, a 25 per cent salary increase every three years for the 24,000 employees of the CEB has been discontinued. Salary increments are allocated exclusively to employees who are actively working and demonstrate productivity. It is a common practice worldwide to provide salary increments selectively rather than uniformly across an organisation. Similarly, bonuses distributed in April and December are contingent upon the entities’ profitability and are awarded solely to employees who contribute effectively,” he said. “The CPC has successfully repaid all loans owed to the Bank of Ceylon and the People’s Bank, resulting in its strengthened financial position.

The revised draft for the restructuring of the CEB has been forwarded to the Legal Draftsman, and once received from there it will be submitted to the Attorney General and subsequently presented to the Cabinet for further recommendations.” Meanwhile, Wijesekera said he would submit a Cabinet paper next week to cancel the tenders given to the investors who have not implemented Renewable Energy projects according to the conditions mentioned in the tenders. He said some investors who have been granted the tenders are now saying they cannot implement the projects according to the present costs. It has also been found that some of the companies that were awarded tenders have sold them to other entities. Thus, the tender call for 500 megawatts of renewable energy is expected to be cancelled in the upcoming Cabinet meeting, and a fresh tender call will be issued, he said. By Methmalie Dissanayake"

Two new cases of Malaria have recently been discovered in Jaffna, in addition to the previously reported five cases. The Jaffna Hospital states that the previous cases of Malaria were caused by the Anopheles Palciparum, while the current cases are attributed to the Anopheles Stephensi. Although the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a certificate stating that Malaria has been eradicated from Sri Lanka, the Malaria and Epidemic Unit of the Jaffna Teaching Hospital emphasises that the threat of Malaria in Sri Lanka has not been completely eliminated. This is due to Sri Lankans travelling to countries in Africa and other regions where malaria is still prevalent. BY Rasadhi Chathurangi Gamage – Vavuniya"

The comparative June 2018 tourist arrival figure was 146,828 and total tourist arrivals in June 2022 numbered 32,856. However, tourism earnings in the first five months of this year were short by USD 1.1 billion compared to the first five months of 2018 which year thus far was the best year for tourism, official data further showed.

GMOF President, Dr. Rukshan Bellana yesterday (4) said, “We know that the medicines that are purchased allegedly do not meet the standards and that there have been incidences of deaths that have been caused as a result. But there is a question as to whether the Health Minister wants to conceal this truth by giving various bribes to his officials and trade unionists. Besides violating policy decisions taken during the 2023 Budget to extend the retirement age of Consultants and other medical practitioners, there are notable incidents that show the Minister’s efforts to bribe Health Ministry officials and trade unionists.” Certain health officials including the Director General of Health Services who has travelled abroad six times was given permission to travel overseas for the seventh time even though trade unions and other professional categories brought this to Minister Rambukwella’s attention.  “There are major objections against high-level health officials travelling overseas regularly even when the trips are offered to other categories in the State health services, the most recent being the DGHS’s tour to Geneva. When it should have been a Community Physician and public health officers who accompanied him on the tour the opportunity was given to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA). It is because of these public health officers and community specialists that Sri Lanka could boast of her quality of health,” he said. Dr. Bellana alleged that the most competent person for the position had been overlooked while awarding the CEO post of the NMRA. “The present CEO who is another political appointee allegedly uses the Health Minister’s name while soliciting bribes. He is referred to as Mr. 10% in the Health service,” the GMOF President alleged.  “Minister Rambukwella exempted a trade union leader amongst members of the minor employees from carrying out his duties for the 14th consecutive year so that he could allegedly engage in trade union work in a bid to keep them happy while overlooking the corruption that was taking place,” Dr. Bellana charged, noting that according to experts even Maithripala Sirisena, who was a predecessor of Minister Rambukwella did not degrade the State health service to this extent.

During a media briefing yesterday (4), Gammanpila said their scrutiny of the Cabinet Memorandum on domestic debt optimisation, along with the Central Bank’s (CBSL) presentation to the Cabinet, revealed that the Government’s claims were false. According to the Cabinet Memorandum dated 28 June 2023, presented by the Minister of Finance, the outstanding value of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) is USD 886 million or Rs 272 billion. The CBSL presentation indicated a capital reduction, also known as a haircut, of 30 per cent on SLDBs, amounting to Rs 81.6 billion. Gammanpila highlighted that domestic banks hold 85 per cent of the SLDBs, resulting in a loss of Rs 69 billion due to the haircut. Additionally, a 30 per cent haircut is applicable to Foreign Currency Banking Unit (FCBU) loans, which amount to USD 323 million or Rs 92 billion. This translates to a loss of Rs 28 billion. Therefore, the alleged total loss from both SLDBs and FCBU loans amounts to Rs 97 billion, he claimed. Furthermore, Gammanpila stressed that there will be an approximate 35 per cent reduction in interest rates as part of the DDR. Although they have not calculated the specific loss associated with this interest rate reduction, he believes it will have an adverse impact on commercial banks’ liquidity and profitability during the DDR process, Gammanpila added.

During a media briefing, SJB MP Nalin Bandara stressed that dissolving Parliament and facilitating an election would be a favour to both the party and the country, allowing them to govern with a newly-elected SJB government. Bandara said, “The entire country agrees that the present 225 members in Parliament lack a mandate. We also view this as a violation of the mandate. Wickremesinghe needs the SJB to remain as President. He is a shrewd politician. He is only offering us assistance to achieve his own objectives.” Bandara further demanded that President Wickremesinghe terminate what he referred to as his “deal” with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and dissolve Parliament. President Wickremesinghe on Monday (3) reiterated his previous invitation to the SJB, led by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, urging them to prioritise the national interest over politics and join efforts to resolve public issues. Wickremesinghe suggested that the SJB could remain in the Opposition and support his Administration’s recovery and reform agenda through the parliamentary committee system. He also expressed disappointment with the SJB for what he implied was a politically motivated attack on Sri Lanka’s domestic debt restructuring plan. In response to the President’s statement, Bandara stressed, “If you genuinely want to assist us, dissolve Parliament immediately. That would be a favour to us and the country. Then you can continue to govern with a new team for a while longer.” He also mentioned that the SJB would consider Wickremesinghe’s offer to “help him” once Parliament has been dissolved, noting that the President has had the legal authority to dissolve Parliament since March 2023.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

However, that victim was not a resident of Jaffna District, but was from the Southern Province.  During a press conference held yesterday (4),   he pointed out the breakdown of dengue cases by district was: 1,491 in Jaffna, 65 in Kilinochchi, 77 in Mannar, 106 in Vavuniya, and 104 in Mullaitivu. Notably, the Nallur and Karaveddy areas of Jaffna City are particularly at risk of the spread of dengue. Dr. Sathyamoorthy also highlighted the high prevalence of dengue in the Gampaha District. To combat the spread of the disease, it is crucial to eliminate the mosquitoes that transmit dengue as these mosquitoes breed in various locations and contribute to the spread of the disease. Given the significant impact of dengue in the Jaffna District, the public’s cooperation in maintaining a clean environment is essential to prevent dengue infections.  He requested the public for their full support to avoid dengue pandemic. “Keep the environment clean and give full cooperation,” he said.

Instead, China is engaging in bilateral negotiations with the Sri Lankan Government, ‘separately’. “They will not come on board on the common platform but will corporate bilaterally. We are confident China will support the restructuring of the debt in that manner,” Foreign Minister Ali Sbary said yesterday (3). At the press conference held by Minister Sabry, at the President’s Media Centre (PMC), he emphasised that both governments are actively involved in negotiations, bilaterally and on the common platform, where China was present and knows all the parameters of these negotiations with other creditors as well. China’s bilateral is three folds, which are with the Chinese Government, the second is of the Exim Bank and the third is the Chinese Development Bank. He added that the good thing is that China knows the parameters of the discussions held with other creditors, as they are present at all the discussions and it would be comparable treatment on the bilateral basis at the end of the day. He said “China has its own reason why it does not want to be on the common platform. That is fine with us as long as they come to us and give the same relief what we want,” he pointed out. Sabry stressed that he met top Chinese investors and the president of the Exim Bank and the China Development Bank. He also told the media that the CHEC Developers of the Port City expressed their keen interest in investing of USD 1.2billion in a project at the Port City and Sinopec has agreed to invest in an oil refinery project in Hambantota. President Ranil Wickremesinghe earlier said that the CHEC wanted to construct an International Financial centre at the Port City.  When asked about China, the largest creditor, not joining the common platform with other creditors, the minister explained that China is currently engaged in continuous discussions with Sri Lanka. These discussions are taking place through two separate lines of communication. One line involves negotiations within the common platform, while the other is a bilateral approach. The minister emphasised that Sri Lanka wants to avoid becoming entangled in China’s multilateral dealings, as there are fundamental differences in their approach. The main concern for Sri Lanka is focused solely on restructuring its debt and finding a mutually beneficial solution. He assured that China would not receive separate treatment in the debt restructuring process. According to the deal made with the IMF in March, all countries were expected to provide assurance and cooperate with the debt restructuring efforts initiated by the IMF. The President of Sri Lanka personally wrote to all countries, emphasising that they would be treated equally and comparably, without any difference in the treatment received. He further stated that the process is transparent, ensuring fairness and accountability. These considerations form the basis for the preparation of the debt sustainability analysis, he said, adding that it is within this context that the assessments have been made. He said countries that have undergone debt restructuring programmes have experienced a subsequent default after making 60 per cent of their payments. Sri Lanka’s goal is to ensure that any defaults, which occurred last year, are ultimately eliminated. By prioritising timely repayment, the aim is to prevent any further defaults in the future. In response to concerns about potential rupee depreciation when  debt repayments begin, he emphasised that the government’s reforms are aimed at achieving steadfast and sustainable progress. “By attracting investments, promoting tourism, and increasing remittance through exports, they believe they can effectively manage the debt crisis. The focus is on implementing measures that will stimulate economic growth and create a favourable environment for both domestic and foreign investments, thus mitigating the risk of currency depreciation.” The Foreign Minister also noted that Sri Lanka’s export has decreased from 31 per cent to 14.5 per cent and the government is to establish a one stop shop for investors. “Then we think of digitisation of the country. Then we got to focus on renewable energy to reduce the expenditure on oil purchasing.  If we can promote tourism and bring more investors to port city we can gain from those income,” he said. “We are planning on export oriented manufacturing economy we are focusing on and working on a roadmap,” he added. The debt analysis takes into account various factors, including projected outflows and inflows over the next 10 years, revenue estimates and payment obligations, according to Minister Sabry.

Silva, addressing the media, also criticised the Gazette that enables the subject minister to recall dissolved Local Government entities and extend the current tenure. The Minister of Local Government has been granted the authority to recall disbanded local government bodies through a gazette notification, he said. “According to the gazette notification, issued on 27 June if the extended term of local government bodies exceeds the stipulated period, the responsible minister has the power to reconvene them for an additional period. As a result, it becomes possible to reconvene the dissolved local government bodies. If these bodies have already announced an election but are unable to proceed due to a crisis situation in the country, this gazette notification allows for the recall of the local government bodies. The Minister has been granted the power to convene them. “This amendment has been introduced as section 2 (c) in the Municipal Council Act of 1987,” Silva said. Referring to this gazette, Silva accused Wickremesinghe of attempting to consolidate power, disregard the Constitution and engage in dictatorial practices, adding that it is important to defeat these attempts and hold those responsible accountable. “This kind of political greed and practice should not exist in our country or be allowed to consolidate power. Ranil Wickremesinghe is trying to set aside the Constitution, intimidate officials and assume a dictatorial role. Sri Lanka has violated IMF conditions 13 times.

Premadasa emphasised the importance of preserving both indigenous and traditional medicine fields. He criticised the current government for potentially jeopardising the traditional medicine sector in the country through the new Bill. While acknowledging the need for a legal framework for the Ayurvedic medicine sector, Premadasa argued that such a framework should be developed in accordance with the principles of Ayurvedic medicine and traditional medicine, catering to the needs of both fields. Premadasa further suggested that instead of hastily introducing such Bills, it would be more beneficial for the parties involved, including the Minister of Health, to engage in formal discussions and gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

Ratnayake stressed that the reduction of the current electricity tariffs proves that the increase in electricity tariffs in February 2023 was based on wrong data as he had pointed out. Ratnayake recalled that some of the data presented by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), for tariff revisions, were incorrect and a proper investigation will prove it. “Last February, the Ceylon Electricity Board proposed to increase the tariffs by 66 per cent. But at that time, the actual cost data revealed that a 30 per cent tariff increase was sufficient. Therefore, I opposed the 66 per cent tariff revision. We should have limited the rate increase to 30 per cent at that time, in order to protect five million electricity consumers as well as minimise the negative impact on the economy. But due to political pressure, three members of the Commission approved the proposal presented by the CEB as it was. He added that now, they themselves have admitted that the CEB data is wrong, which is why the CEB has decided to reduce the electricity tariffs by 14 per cent instead of the proposed reduction of three per cent. “Because I was against the increase in fees, a vote was held in the parliament and I was removed from my position.” He said he is happy to give up the post of chairman to someone else as everyone has accepted his argument. “I commend the new chairman and members of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka. Because the steps I took then, to protect the independence of the Commission, are being continued today by them. The Commission should be appreciated on the steps taken to protect the rights of all electricity consumers.”Rathnayake also pointed out that energy poverty has increased due to the increase in unfair tariffs implemented in February. “Nearly 0.5 million electricity consumers have reduced their electricity consumption to zero. When they get an unaffordable electricity bill, their response was to reduce consumption. Special attention should be paid to this customer group. Justice has been done to some extent in this year’s tariff revision. The annual amount of electricity generated by hydropower is nearly 5000 gigawatt hours. A unit costs less than five rupees. Nearly five million low consumption domestic consumers consume less than 2000 gigawatt hours of electricity annually. The annual electricity consumption of 45,000 religious places is about 90 gigawatt hours. So, all these people can be supplied with electricity at a very low price. Also, a reasonable fee can be given to small and medium enterprises as well.” Rathnayake further emphasised that he is committed to protecting the rights of not only electricity consumers but also all consumers who are suffering due to various injustices.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

During the event, the President received a special commemorative edition of ‘Amaraviru Abhiman 32’ and presented commemorative gifts to farmers, agriculture supporters, and students who achieved academic success in the Hambantota District. “In continuation, as Prime Minister of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s government, I announced our intention to move forward with the participation of all members. In 2022, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa invited all Parliamentary party leaders to the President’s Office. Unfortunately, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya(SJB) and Janata Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP) boycotted the meeting. During that time, I, along with R. Sampanthan and MaithripalaSirisena, discussed how to resolve this issue. Despite our efforts to bring everyone together, after the incident on 9 May 2022, the SJB did not join us, even though they were offered the opportunity to participate without assuming the post of Prime Minister. Consequently, our government was formed, and we began our duties. I was appointed President, Dinesh Gunawardena became the Prime Minister and Mahinda Amaraweera was entrusted with the responsibility of the Agriculture Minister. Despite the challenges faced by the agriculture sector, Amaraweera’s leadership has allowed us to make significant progress,” he said."

Kumudesh lambasted Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwellafor pushing the health service into further quandary.  “The Health Ministry does not hold itself responsible for the Health Ministry while the government too does not hold itself responsible for the Health Ministry. When this is the situation it is apparent that there would be no one to take responsibility for patients, which is why the health service unions have not struck work despite having ample reasons to do so till now,” said. He warned that the remaining health service trade unions would take up the cudgel if the Health Ministry took action only to extend the date of retirement of only the medical practitioners, while forcing the others into retirement by the age of 60.  “Already the medical practitioners are engaged in work not related to the medical profession. Therefore the CMLSSL and other health professional categories would not tolerate the Health Minister’s efforts to violate the government’s policy of retirement to extend the date of retirement only for consultants and other medical practitioners,” Kumudesh said.

It has been found that the attackers received assistance from another prison officer. The Police Homicide and Organised Crimes Division has disclosed that the assault was captured on video and sent to a notorious underworld gang member known as ‘Handaya’,  who is currently residing abroad. In a significant development, two individuals, including a Captain of the Sri Lanka Army, were apprehended in Nuwara Eliya.  The authorities discovered a cache of weapons in their possession, including a T-56 firearm, two Browning pistols and 167 rounds of ammunition. Interrogations of the suspects revealed that the attack had been orchestrated at the behest of the underworld figure ‘Handaya’. Furthermore, the assailants obtained details about the targeted guard’s private residence from another prisons officer. Subsequently, on 30 June, three additional individuals, believed to be involved in the incident, along with the van used in the attack, were taken into Police custody. The investigation is ongoing, with law enforcement agencies working diligently to unravel the complexities surrounding the case. The incident occurred on 12 May when Sankha Kusal Marasinghe, a prison guard, at the Magazine New Remand Prison, was ambushed by three unidentified assailants at his private residence in Minuwangoda. The perpetrators forcibly entered the guard’s home, compelling him to kneel on the floor before subjecting him to a vicious assault, accompanied by menacing threats to his life. According to the guard’s statement to the Police, the attackers attempted to restrain him using zip-ties but resorted to brandishing a firearm, placing it against his head as a dire warning against interfering with heroin trafficking operations within the prison. The assailants, aware of the potential consequences, cautioned the guard against reporting the incident to the authorities, promising dire consequences if he failed to comply. Shockingly, one of the attackers recorded the entire assault on video. Following the traumatic ordeal, the prison guard filed a complaint with the Minuwangoda Police, after which he was admitted to the Minuwangoda Hospital. Subsequently, he was transferred to the Gampaha Hospital. Marasinghe had gained recognition for his successful raids within the prison, receiving an award for seizing the highest number of contraband items in the Magazine New Remand Prison during the 2018/2019 period. Authorities suspect that his relentless efforts to curb illicit activities behind bars may have served as the motive for the attack."

The jumbo is expected to receive treatment from Thai veterinary surgeons in Chiang Mai. The elephant arrived in Thailand just after 2:00 p.m. (0800 GMT). “He arrived in Chiang Mai perfectly,” Thai Environment Minister Varawut Silpa-archa said at the airport. “He travelled five hours and nothing is wrong, his condition is normal,” he added. Thai officials said the repatriation of the 4,000 kg mammal cost USD 700,000. The Ilyushin IL-76 cargo aircraft carrying Muthu Raja took off around 7:40 a.m., the Airport Duty Manager said. The elephant will be quarantined at a nature reserve on arrival in Chiang Mai. Veterinarians had prepared to airlift the Asian elephant from Sri Lanka back to its home country of Thailand over the weekend after it spent more than two decades at a Buddhist temple. The Thai Royal Family gifted the elephant to the Sri Lankan Government in 2001, which in turn gifted it to the Kande Viharaya Temple where it was named ‘Muthu Raja’ and given honoured roles in religious processions. However, the animal rights group Rally for Animal Rights and Environment (RARE), claimed it was being mistreated, and that it had a stiff leg from a long-neglected injury. It lobbied last year for the intervention of Thai officials, who asked Kande Viharaya Temple officials to allow the jumbo’s return to Thailand for medical treatment. The temple agreed to transfer the elephant last November to the National Zoological Garden – Dehiwala, where it received treatment and was prepared for the journey to Thailand. According to reports, two big abscesses on the elephant had mostly healed. However, the zoo has not been able to fully treat the animal’s leg due to a lack of facilities. Visit Arsaithamkul, Chief Vet of the Zoological Park Organization of Thailand said the treatment in Chiang Mai could include hydrotherapy, laser treatment and acupuncture. At the zoo, Muthu Raja’s morning routine had included veterinarian check-ups, bathing in a small pond and practising getting into the air freight container. The container is cushioned and has windows for feeding, which will include a diet of bananas, pumpkin and sugar cane. Zoo officials had hoisted the 9-foot, 4-ton creature in trial lifts to test the container’s strength. Muthu Raja, also known back in its birthplace as Sak Surin, will be sedated if needed, and two vets will monitor him during the journey, reliable sources said.  Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena told Parliament last month that he expressed his regret to the Thai Premier over the treatment of the elephant during his trip to Thailand in May.

Today I am apologising myself,” Willem-Alexander said. “On this day we remember the Dutch history of slavery, I ask forgiveness for this crime against humanity.” He said racism in Dutch society remains a problem and not everyone would support his apology. The slave trade brought vast riches to his ancestors. The Dutch funded the so-called Golden Age of their empire and culture in the 16th and 17th centuries by shipping about 600,000 Africans as part of the slave trade, mostly to South America and the Caribbean. In December, Prime Minister Mark Rutte apologised on behalf of the Dutch State.  The monarch acknowledged the apology saying “a start has been made” but also there was “still a long way to go.” Descendants of slaves had called for the king to use Saturday’s ceremony at the Oosterpark in Amsterdam to apologise. In his speech broadcast live on national television, Willem-Alexander asked for “forgiveness” saying while nothing had been done about the past for a long time, “at some point, one feels the moral duty to act.” “The chains have truly been broken,” Willem-Alexander said to cheers and applause from thousands of onlookers at the national slavery monument. Slavery was formally abolished in Suriname and other Dutch-held lands on 1 July 1863, but the practice only really ended in 1873 after a 10-year transition period. A Dutch study released in June found the royal family earned 545 million euros (USD 595 million) in today’s terms between 1675 and 1770 from the colonies, where slavery was widespread. The current king’s distant ancestors, Willem III, Willem IV and Willem V, were among the biggest earners from what the report called the Dutch state’s “deliberate, structural and long-term involvement” in slavery. Since the Black Lives Matter Movement emerged in the United States, the Netherlands has embarked on an often difficult debate about its colonial and slave-trading past that turned it into one of the world’s richest countries. In 2022, King Willem-Alexander announced he was ditching the Royal Golden Coach that traditionally transported him on state occasions because it had images of slavery on its sides. One side panel had a picture called Tribute of the Colonies depicting kneeling black people handing over produce such as cocoa and sugarcane to their white masters. While some European leaders have apologised for their country’s colonial past, others have refused to take that step. In January, French President Emmanuel Macron stated he will not “ask forgiveness” from Algeria for French colonisation, but hoped to continue working towards reconciliation. “It’s not up to me to ask forgiveness, that’s not what this is about, that word would break all of our ties,” he said in an interview. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also rejected calls to apologise and offer reparatory justice for victims of the British slave trade and imperialism, saying the attempt to “unpick our history” was not something the Government would “focus its energy on.” (Al Jazeera)"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/07/03/9-of-11-minor-offenders-likely-to-re-offend/,9 of 11 minor offenders likely to re-offend,Author not found,0,2023-07-02T20:30:00+00:00," Owing to the loopholes in the present policies and programmes with regard to youth offenders, at least 9 out of 11 minor offenders are likely to re-offend, it was revealed at the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Reconciliation and National Unity. This was revealed by the Watareka Training School for Youthful Offenders and Department of Community Based Corrections under the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms when they appeared before the committee in Parliament recently. The Watareka Training School accommodates young offenders aged 16-22 who have been sentenced by the Magistrate’s Courts under the Criminal Code for committing offenses. Rather than serving a prison sentence, these individuals are required to complete a compulsory waiting period of three years. After this waiting period, they have the opportunity to apply for a government job in the external environment, as explained by Senior Assistant Secretary of the Watareka Training School for Youthful Offenders, A.V. Vajira Damayanthi. Institutional data reveals a decreasing trend in the number of young convicts being imprisoned from 2013 to 2022. However, it was found that many of the children entering this correctional institution come from broken families, leading to custody issues after the waiting period. The Ministry of Education provides schooling at the Watareka Training School, where attendance is compulsory. Despite this, the pass rates in the General Examination have been consistently low. For instance, in 2014, out of the 16 children who sat for the Ordinary Level examination, only one child passed. The situation did not improve significantly, as only one child passed in 2021. Officials emphasised the challenge of effectively providing vocational education to these children due to the compulsory nature of school education. They acknowledged the need for policy changes in this regard, and the Committee agreed to discuss these issues with relevant institutions and policymakers. The Committee raised concerns about the likelihood of young offenders becoming re-offenders, to which officials pointed out that 9 out of 11 children were likely to re-offend. The committee then shifted its focus to providing necessary facilities to enhance language proficiency among these children and exploring methods to connect them with foreign job opportunities through the Foreign Employment Bureau. Additionally, the Committee highlighted the potential role of community-based correctional departments in alleviating prison overcrowding, emphasising the importance of paying attention to this aspect. They also discussed the alarming fact that about 50 per cent of individuals who should be placed under community-based corrections end up being imprisoned by magistrates. The Committee emphasised the need to address this concerning situation by informing magistrates and encouraging them to take appropriate steps. Officials stressed the importance of providing vocational education to youth offenders, enabling them to secure employment and generate income during the remaining two years after the one-year training period. This approach would not only equip them with economic skills on leaving the institution after the three-year residency period but also reduce the temptation to re-offend, according to the officials’ recommendations.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/30/govt-plans-to-complete-ddo-by-next-month/,Govt plans to complete DDO by next month,Author not found,0,2023-06-29T20:35:00+00:00," Sri Lanka plans to complete the domestic debt optimisation (DDO) programme by next month (July) in order to reduce gross financing needs (GFN) to less than 13 per cent of GDP between 2027 and 2032 (currently, it was around 35.6 per cent of GDP), Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said yesterday. “We plan to launch the DDO programme on Tuesday (4 July) and finalise it within the next month,” he stated at a special press briefing held at the President’s Media Centre in Colombo. Speaking at the briefing, Finance Ministry Secretary K.M. Mahinda Siriwardana emphasised that ongoing fiscal adjustment and external debt restructuring alone are insufficient to meet the IMF-led debt sustainability targets. Sri Lanka received a USD 2.9 billion IMF bailout in March to reduce debt and achieve IMF’s goal of 95 per cent debt to GDP by 2032. He emphasised that restructuring foreign debt alone won’t reduce the GFN to 13 per cent. Secretary Siriwardana suggested that DDO could be feasible without impacting the banking sector, as an additional burden could threaten financial stability. Therefore, the Sri Lankan Government has excluded the banking and financial sector from the DDO process to ensure the safety of deposits of over 57.2 million (with multiple) depositors. The banking sector has already borne significant burdens from fiscal adjustment and economic crisis, with a total tax burden increasing from 39 per cent to 48 per cent. Nonperforming loans have also increased, necessitating high provisioning and capital enhancement. Foreign currency debt restructuring will also impact the banking sector and they have already made 35 per cent provision for their ISB investments. However, over 60 per cent of the domestic debt of the Government is held by the non-commercial banking sector. He also mentioned that the process of restructuring domestic and foreign debt will be considered separately and a 30 per cent haircut from private external creditors is also proposed. Japan, France and India support a common platform for Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring through coordinated negotiation. Debt restructuring discussions aim to reach agreement on perimeter and parameters for bilateral and commercial foreign debt before the upcoming (September) IMF-EFF review. Creditors emphasise the importance of burden sharing for debt treatment, involving both foreign and domestic creditors. Sri Lanka’s debt service reduction during 2022-27 should close external financing gaps of USD 16.9 billion. According to the CBSL, this DDO process will apply to all CBSL Treasury Bill holdings and Provisional Advances to Government, Sri Lanka development Bonds (SLDB) and Foreign Currency Banking Unit (FCBU) assets held by domestic banks and Treasury Bond investments in Superannuation Funds such as EPF and ETF, held until 4 July 2023. According to Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe Superannuation funds would be encouraged to participate to the DDO operation, on the back of higher annual income tax of 30 per cent to be applied to non-participating funds. Therefore, the Government of Sri Lanka plans to restructure its Employment Provident Fund (EPF) by reissuing new bonds for existing bonds, paying 12 per cent until 2025 and nine per cent thereafter. “Current member balances will remain unaffected, and the Government will top up returns below nine per cent. There are discussions about changing the EPF law to guarantee a nine per cent return. The offer to exchange new funds will be made to other provident funds, such as the Employees Trust Fund (ETF),” the Governor said. This DDO process will convert CBSL holdings of Treasury Bills to longer term Treasury Bonds, subject to the approval of the appropriate legislation. This will help to reduce overall financial requirements. The result of this adjustment will be depleted and negative capital on the CBSL’s balance sheet. “Recapitalisation may be required to mitigate the adverse impact of negative equity on CBSL’s credibility and independence,” the Governor stated. The Government also provides holders of SLDBs and FCBUs with two options for DDO participation. The main alternative is to exchange outstanding SLDBs/FCBUs for new USD instruments that are equivalent to foreign creditors, while the second option is to exchange outstanding SLDBs/FCBUs for new Sri Lankan rupee instruments. Sri Lanka’s local currency market debt accounts for a sizeble portion of the country’s public debt, accounting for 42 per cent of overall public debt and more than 50 per cent of GDP. Total local market debt, as of the end of 2022, is estimated to be roughly Rs 12.8 trillion or USD 34.5 trillion, which includes Rs 4.1 trillion in T-Bills and Rs 8.7 trillion in T-Bonds. Sri Lanka’s Government debt has reached an unsustainable level due to challenges in debt servicing, low revenue mobilisation, and limited foreign inflows and market access due to default credit ratings. Access to concessional funding was also limited due to the country’s transition to the middle-income status in the early 2000s. The Government sought assistance from the IMF for an EFF arrangement to restore debt sustainability. The release of the second tranche of EFF would require significant progress on debt restructuring, with Lazard Frères SAS and Clifford Chance LLP contracted to support the process. The Government has already embarked on a fiscal consolidation path, aiming for a sustainable surplus in primary balance. However, further tightening of fiscal stance could be economically and socially costly, as it burdens businesses and households and negatively impacts economic activity. By Ishara Gamage"

We do not export these animals. The Ministry of Agriculture does not have the legal capacity for that. That is why we appointed a committee to find out whether the proposal presented by a Chinese private company can be fulfilled. But now legal action has been taken against it. Even so, there is no change in the position of the relevant Chinese company seeking the toque monkeys,” he said. “We requested, on many occasions to submit comments and suggestions from all parties, regarding the prevention of wild animal damage to crops. Some suggestions have been implemented so far and have failed. For example, they suggested various tactics to repel animals. Extermination is not a successful strategy to prevent wildlife damage. Even if they flee from one place, they wreak havoc in another,” Amaraweera added. “Also, some said, every farmer should set aside half-an-acre of cultivated land for wild animals. But we don’t know if the farmers will like it. And even if half an acre is allotted, this is our own share. There is no way for the animals to think that we are not going to other parts. Some other organisations said to hang saris around the plantation. We have to think how many saris one farmer will have to buy to hang around three to four acres. And some others said to hang tins around the farm and around the trees. No constructive and practical proposals were presented except such non-practical nonsensical proposals,” he asserted. Speaking further, Amaraweera said, some others ‘advised’ to do sterile surgeries like vasectomy and tubectomy. “These animal welfare associations do not know that like all these sterilised animals, the sutures break and they die in extreme suffering. They only want foreign dollars. All they do is show the animals of our country and earn foreign currency to live.” The minister alleged that those who oppose the plan do not know the hardships farmers are going through in the country due to crop damage caused by wild animals. “So, I have to tell you, don’t ask us about preventing crop damage caused by wild animals. Ask the gentlemen and ladies of these animal welfare associations who depend on the dollars they receive from animals in cold rooms in Colombo, he stressed. “Some claimed that these animals were taken to eat their brains. Various lies were told. But now, somehow, the best arrangement to prevent animal damage was disrupted. Now the solutions for the measures to be taken in relation to crop damage should be asked from the animal welfare associations that have been disrupted. If this arrangement had been implemented, our toque monkeys would not have died. They had the opportunity to live with the love and kindness of thousands of people in foreign zoos. Farmers are now asking for guns to protect crops. What happens then? The end is the death of these animals.”"

These include 456,806 for elderly allowances, 19,496 for kidney patients’ allowances, 46,857 disability allowances and 523,159 public assistance programme allowances. The disclosure of this information will provide clarity and transparency regarding the distribution of benefits across multiple social support initiatives. The PMD said, in a statement, that with an overwhelming response, the Divisional Secretariats across the island have received a staggering 3.7 million applications for the Aswesuma Social Security Benefit Programme. Out of the selected applicants, a list comprising two million names has been released to the public, designating them as eligible beneficiaries, pending appeals and objections, the PMD said. “Following a comprehensive survey, a total of 3.3 million applications have been carefully selected, marking a significant milestone in the programme’s implementation. Out of the selected applicants, a list comprising two million names has been released to the public, designating them as eligible beneficiaries, pending appeals and objections. The selection process was diligently overseen by a three-member committee at the Divisional Secretariat level, with final approval granted by the District Secretary. This meticulous approach ensured that deserving candidates were rightfully chosen to benefit from the programme.” For individuals who believe they qualify for the Aswesuma welfare , but do not find their names on the published list, a window of opportunity has been provided to file appeals until 10 July, the statement said. “Furthermore, if any details of individuals who should not receive social welfare benefits are identified in the public list, a mechanism for anonymous complaints has also been established. Appeals and objections can be submitted in writing to the Divisional Secretariats, which have been duly informed of the process. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has underscored the importance of fairness and inclusivity in implementing this programme, ensuring that no one is unjustly treated or left behind. Directives have been issued to all Divisional Secretariats to adhere to the government’s decisions, further emphasising the commitment to uphold transparency and equity. Lastly, an annual opportunity is extended to individuals who were unable to register for the Aswesuma Social Welfare Benefit Programme, as well as those who wish to join the programme anew. This initiative ensures that individuals have a chance to avail themselves of the programme’s benefits and support, contributing to their overall welfare and well-being,” the PMD said."

Devananda expressed confidence and hope that President Wickremesinghe would be dedicated to implementing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The Minister held a meeting with representatives of active civil organisations involved in politics in the Northern Province, specifically in Jaffna. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the current political situation and determine further actions in consultation with them. During the meeting, the necessity of implementing the 13th Amendment was emphasised. It was argued that if the elected members of the Northern Provincial Council had effectively utilised their power, there would have been potential for introducing a federal system in the Northern Province. However, due to various factors, the situation took an adverse turn. Additionally, Minister Devananda was informed that the LTTE and the politicians in the province, who closely collaborated with the previous Good Governance Government, were responsible for exacerbating the tragic situation faced by the Tamil community as a whole. Devananda emphasised the urgency of addressing this issue and highlighted that the President has taken proactive measures to rebuild unity and harmony, which have been undermined by the growing influence of divisive political forces in the country. The Minister said he firmly believes that implementing the 13th Amendment is the only solution to resolve the longstanding ethnic crisis. He expressed his regret that the LTTE and certain political organisations have failed to accept this solution for the past 30 years. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He said the report highlighted that there should ideally be 103 cardiologists, but currently, only 57 are practising. Furthermore, eight of the remaining cardiologists are set to retire by December. This situation poses a threat of closing nearly 50 Peripheral Hospitals across the country. Dr. Jayatissa further presented data from the report, stating, “By 2028, the country should have 418 physiotherapists, but the current count is only 240, and 22 of them are scheduled to retire by December. Initially, there were 247 surgeons, but now there are only 145. Furthermore, 23 of them are expected to retire in December. Similarly, there were 302 paediatricians, but only 146 remain, and 28 of them will retire by the end of December. Additionally, 24 Gynaecologists and obstetricians have already left the country. Previously, there were 284 Anaesthesiologists, but the number has dwindled to 129, and 18 of them will retire by the end of this year.” He also expressed concern about the impact of paediatricians leaving the country, which resulted in the closure of the professor unit affiliated with the Rajarata Faculty of Medicine, operated by the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. Currently, a specialist doctor has been temporarily assigned to the Thambuttegama Hospital. The shortage of cardiologists is also alarming, as the country falls short of the required 103, with only 57 in practice. Additionally, eight of the remaining cardiologists will retire by December. The report also indicated that there should ideally be 129 dermatologists, but only 66 are currently available, and eight of them are set to retire in December. This shortage of healthcare professionals is evident across various fields, and the trend of professionals leaving the country continues. Consequently, several wards in Peripheral Hospitals are unable to operate effectively. He emphasised the gravity of the situation, saying, “Out of the approximately 18,600 general doctors, a significant number, ranging from 1,500 to 1,700, have already left the country. The closure of 50 Peripheral Hospitals looms as a real threat. There is a limit to how long this situation can persist with the available doctors. Even if there are specialists remaining, their efforts will be futile without an adequate number of general doctors to provide support.

He also said the Sri Lankan Government will soon set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to bring long-standing peace to the island nation with consensus from all communities. The Minister further said the Sri Lankan Government is holding continuous interactions with the Tamil Diaspora and people and leaders living in different parts of the world. “We resolved most of our problems with the support we got from the Indian Government led by PM Modi. We are hopeful to bring normalcy back to Sri Lanka,” Rajapakshe, who handles the Justice Department, told PTI on Saturday on the sidelines of the Peace Conference in Nagpur city of Maharashtra. Sri Lanka was hit by an unprecedented financial crisis in 2022 that also sparked political turmoil in the island nation which led to the ouster of the all-powerful Rajapaksa family. The crisis led to the formation of a government led by Ranil Wickremesinghe which was tasked with stabilising the economy and restoring the financial health of the economy. Rajapakshe said Sri Lanka witnessed 30 years of war and disastrous things in which 60,000 lives were lost. “I took many initiatives to help the people affected by the war. We have commenced the process in 2016 and launched the offices for missing people, reparation of peace, and reconciliation of peace,” Rajapakshe added. He was replying to a query on complaints from ethnic communities and religious minorities in Sri Lanka about alleged injustice and discrimination and the role of the Sri Lankan justice system. “The Sri Lankan Government will set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and we are trying to ensure long-standing peace in consensus with all communities. “We have resolved many issues. There were several litigations and so many prisoners. However, now all these issues have become minimal. Sri Lanka is addressing all the issues from every angle,” Rajapakshe said. He said the Sri Lankan Government held dialogues and interactions with the Tamil community to reach some understanding to resolve the issues. “We are holding continuous interactions with the Tamil Diaspora, people and leaders living in different parts of the world. Now, all have supported establishing peace. They also categorically say that everybody in Sri Lanka has suffered. It is not confined to a particular community in Sri Lanka,” the minister said. He said the Government is of the view that these problems mustn’t be passed to the next generations. “We should ensure that in our country all Sri Lankans whether they are Muslims, Tamils, or Sinhalese live in peace with the Sri Lankan identity. We are hopeful to accomplish this,” he said. Rajapakshe also spoke about how Sri Lanka is addressing the economic crises in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. “The country’s economy was in dire straits and inflation was around 97 per cent (when the new government took over). We were going through a very difficult period. We didn’t even have 2 million when we took over. We told this truth to the people,” he said. Our target was to bring inflation to a single digit in a year and ensure people get essential foods, coal and gas and increase foreign reserve up to USD 5 billion, he added. “We have brought down the inflation to 21 per cent. People do not face power cuts and coal shortages. Essential goods are available adequately. Our foreign reserves stand at 3.5 billion and we hope to increase it to USD 5 billion,” Rajapakshe added. He said the Government has stabilised the political and economic situation in the country. Queried on allegations that the ex-Sri Lankan President tampered with Police records to stall investigations into the alleged discovery of mass graves in an area where he was a military officer during the Marxist rebellion in 1989, Rajapakshe said, “There is no possibility of tampering with the records as he (Rajapaksa) is not in power”. “There had been some allegations in the last few days, and certainly, authorities will continue with the investigation. If guilty are found the normal laws of the country will take course,” he added. Rajapakshe also spoke about introducing a new bill to be passed in Sri Lankan Parliament next month to address the corruption in the public sector. (PTI)"

In response, Lanka Sathosa officials explained the loss was due to the delay in receiving money and the goods were imported based on the policy decisions of the Government. The COPE Chair emphasised the need to prepare a business model suitable for Sathosa. The Auditor General also pointed out the internal administrative weaknesses as well as the need to establish this institution under a business model that can make decisions independently without external interference. The Committee also emphasised the need to attract more customers to Lanka Sathosa stores. Attention was drawn towards the fact that a concrete plan for 2021-24 was in place but it was not approved by the Ministry. Therefore, the Committee Chair informed the officials to prepare a comprehensive plan up until 2028 and report on its activities within 2 months. The COPE Chair further instructed to prepare an action plan. It was discussed that although there are 21 internal audit staff, only 3 audits have been submitted for 2021 and none for 2022. Moreover, attention was drawn to the auditor’s difficulty in obtaining information regarding the company’s accounts. Accordingly, the Auditor General also informed that the Internal Audit Department should be notified in this regard through an internal circular.

It was also discussed that the imported rice has been sold for animal feed due to expiry.

Speaking at a media briefing yesterday, Dr. de Silva said the SJB does not agree with the idea of restructuring local debt. He highlighted the lack of clarity regarding the specific proposals put forth by the Government. He emphasised that if the proposal includes a 20 per cent reduction in any form, the SJB’s opposition remains firm. While the exact details of the Government’s proposal are yet to be seen, it is expected to be presented to Cabinet and the Committee on Public Finance in the coming days. “The impact of this deduction on individuals who have deposited money in banks will play a crucial role in determining the SJB’s response. If the Central Bank (CBSL) offers fixed deposits for five years, and the Government suggests extending them for another five years while only paying additional interest for that period, the SJB is entirely against such a proposition,” he asserted. Speaking further, he said when people deposit their hard-earned money in banks, those funds are lent to entrepreneurs and industrialists by the banks. If the government delays repaying the loans taken from the bank within five years and depositors demand the return of their money, the bank should have the capacity to fulfil these requests, he pointed out. “As per the Central Bank’s regulations, any liquidity requirements faced by banks should be addressed by the Central Bank itself,” he said.

Health sources in the Ministry yesterday (28) alleged that instead of defending the budgetary decision and the collective responsibility which he bore as a Minister by upholding the Cabinet decision, taken with regard to the retirement age, Minister Rambukwella has made a move to keep certain officials of the Health Ministry and medical practitioners happy so as to subdue issues pertaining to medicinal drugs which emerged recently. It is apparent that the Cabinet would be left to unravel the problems which would come up as a result. The age of retirement was limited to 60 years on a 2022 budgetary proposal taken in Parliament. Therefore it may seem as though the Court would have no right to reverse a decision taken through the Constitution. All State employees are faced with that decision where their retirement age has been limited to 60 years with no exceptions, they noted. Health Secretary A. Janaka Sri Chandragupta submitted an affidavit in the Court of Appeal on Tuesday (27) declaring that his Ministry had no objections to extending the age of retirement of medical officers, specified in the Gazette Notification, bearing No. 2310/07 dated 12 December 2022, up to 63 years “subject to obtaining approval from the Cabinet of Ministers and other relevant authorities pursuant to submitting a Cabinet Memorandum in that regard.” The medical practitioners included in last December’s Gazette Notice include grade medical officers, specialists, Medical Administrators, dental surgeons,  and  registered medical officers. The budgetary decision last year declared that the age of retirement of all State employees would be brought down from 65 years to 60 years of age.   Sources warned that this would only create further unrest in the State health service as other service categories such as nurses and professions supplementary to medicine and paramedical services would also demand the same. President of the Government Medical Officers Forum (GMOF), Dr. Rukshan Bellana alleged that at a time when the government was going through an economic crisis and was depending on the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which wanted it tone down its workforce burden, the Health Minister and his officials were attempting to make a joke of decision taken by the Parliament and Cabinet. Dr. Bellana noted that if there was a shortage of consultants for sub specialities there were possibilities of extending their services on contract basis rather than extending the age of retirement of all medical practitioners and thereby increasing the burden on the government.     By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

He said Sri Lanka was drifting into anarchy and facing its worst economic crisis last year. The poverty gap was widening and over 500,000 persons had lost their jobs. It is the worst crisis Sri Lanka has faced since receiving independence from the British 75 years ago, Ratnapriya said. He said rescuing them from this tragic situation was the prime focus of the ‘Aswesuma’ welfare programme. Speaking to the media at Sirikotha, Ratnapriya said everyone knows that there are many shortcomings in the Samurdhi relief programme and added that a total of 17 million people received Samurdhi subsidy on average and unfortunately those who were not entitled to this programme were also among them. It has come to light that there are people among the beneficiaries who lend money on interest on a six-month or one-year basis, Ratnapriya said. This problem has been unresolved for a long time. It had been emphasised in 2002 to formulate a new effective programme by conducting a census, but no Government did so, Ratnapriya charged.  There are nearly 51,000 persons who have kidney complications, those suffering from various ailments and there were plans to give this aid to 2 million people. The World Bank had recommended increasing benefits for those at the grassroots level as the present relief assistance is not sufficient to combat the increasing needs, Ratnapriya added.

The President’s Media Division (PMD), in a statement said, this restructuring plan is part of a larger effort to address the country’s total foreign debt of USD 41.5 billion. The President made these remarks during the inauguration ceremony of the new building of the Gampaha District Secretariat. The President emphasised that it is also necessary to restructure Sri Lanka’s local debt. However, he assured that this restructuring process would not have any negative impact on the stability of the country’s banking system, which includes both state-owned and private banks under the supervision of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). President Wickremesinghe reassured that the restructuring of local debt would not affect deposits held in the banking system and there would be no impact on the interest paid on bank deposits. He further stated that the restructuring would not impact the member balances of superannuation funds, such as the Employee’s Provident Fund (EPF) and the Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF). The rate of return on these funds that has been paid in the past will also remain unaffected by the debt restructuring."

Kariyawasam was the Minister of Education during the Good Governance Government. Speaking at a media briefing held at Sirikotha, Kariyawasam expressed his disappointment with the circulation of news stories that falsely accuse the previous government with regard to this matter. He said extensive efforts had been made to finalise arrangements to provide tab computers to students under the Good Governance Government, on the instructions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Unfortunately, due to the change in government in 2019, this programme couldn’t be implemented. Kariyawasam said the plan was initially to distribute tab computers to G.C.E. A/L students and later expand it to include students up to Grade 6. The required number of teachers had been trained, and an efficient content plan had been prepared. However, after the new government came to power, they implemented a different programme that contradicted the previous plans and recommendations, disregarding the Cabinet decision made during the Good Governance Government. According to Kariyawasam, tab computers and laptops were distributed to security forces, departments, and teachers at the College of Education, neglecting the targeted group of schoolchildren. This resulted in a significant waste of funds without any tangible benefits or outcomes. Kariyawasam told the public not to blame the Good Governance Government for the failure of the programme. The project had received approval through 14 Cabinet papers, but unfortunately, it could not be implemented following the change in government. He emphasised that the Good Governance Government cannot be held responsible as they had initiated the programme and expressed concern that it did not achieve its intended objectives.  By Naalir Jamaldeen"

SLAITO claims that they were not consulted prior to the SLTDA taking this decision and that the minimum rates are not competitive. However, the SLTDA has stated that it was the two major associations, namely The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) and the Colombo City Hotels Association (CCHA), who requested the introduction of minimum rates for Colombo city hotels. After three months of discussions, these associations could not reach a conclusion. In response, the SLTDA requested them to submit a written request, following which the SLTDA proposed a minimum rate of USD 130 per room for city hotels. This minimum rate and the directive suggest that everyone should promote rooms priced above USD 130, considering that five-star hotels currently sell rooms at rates exceeding this threshold. As room rates are determined by market demands, this directive has been sent to all tourism associations and a copy has also been forwarded to the presidential secretariat. SLAITO argues that the directive on minimum room rates does not align with their markets and will place Sri Lanka at a disadvantage compared to other countries. They contend that Sri Lanka’s competitive markets will suffer while competitors gain an advantage. Presently, there are over 7,000 rooms in city hotels in Colombo, and these establishments are already competing with hotels in New Delhi. SLAITO emphasises that the new rate directive will not benefit Sri Lanka. They have expressed their concerns to the Minister of Tourism, Harin Fernando, who has also acknowledged the lack of clear guidance regarding the room rates. Currently, room rates in city hotels range between USD 65 and 80. However, the directive proposes an increase to USD 130. SLAITO believes that before implementing such prescribed rates, it is crucial to generate demand and interest in Sri Lanka. They argue that adopting these rates will render Sri Lanka uncompetitive and result in a loss of clients, even when compared to hotels in New Delhi, with which they are currently competitive.

The protesters expressed their discontent over the placement of Buddha statues and the construction of Buddhist stupas near the Hindu temples in the northern region. They claimed that these actions have hindered Hindu devotees from conducting their religious activities and alleged that the Department of Archaeology has forcefully acquired a significant amount of land belonging to the people of the north. The protest was aimed to draw the President’s attention to these issues and seek his intervention in resolving the ownership disputes and preserving the religious sanctity of the temples mentioned.

Prabath Chandrakeerthi, Adviser cum Private Secretary to the Minister, Shan Yahampath and other Ministry officials to address the need for important labour reforms. The primary focus of the meeting was to advocate for progressive labour regulations that will help to ensure a safe and conducive working environment for employees, complemented by a well-designed safety net post-employment. The meeting concluded on a very positive note with the department officials and COYLE in agreement to cooperate to venture into further possibilities of reviewing reforms to help develop a larger economy in Sri Lanka thereby creating a large pool of jobs. The post-pandemic situation as well as the economic crisis faced by Sri Lanka has resulted in the much-observed ‘brain drain’ that is occurring. COYLE believes this can only be prevented in the future years by ensuring that our economy has a significant increase in the number of private sector institutions capable of delivering sufficient wages to its workforce. The public sector has been burdened and rendered inefficient due to the large redundant workforce that has been brought onto its payroll by politically motivated decisions made by all governments during the past decades. This crisis should be the final catalyst for shifting the thought mechanism of burdening the public sector with short-term decision-making for political mileage to develop the private sector to amass a larger job pool and more career-building opportunities as all developed countries. COYLE shall be working closely with the ministry with the view of progressive reforms that remove the conflictive culture that presently exists between the Labour Department and the employer to put forth mechanisms that provide a fair safety net for employees whilst ensuring a more progressive legislation that will not deter investors away from Sri Lanka."

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

Nonawatta, Fifty Acres, Elpitikanda, Wembiliwatta, and Bambaragahaela are these five villages. Out of this, 374 families were provided water by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and Kandy Community Water Supply Department through the Diyatha organisation. The protesters said the water supply was discontinued five months ago due to non-payment of electricity and water bills by the society. The villagers produced their water bills and said, although they had paid the water bills on time, the situation has arisen because the society has not paid the money to the relevant institutions. They allege despite the amount being increased to Rs 2.8 million, the Water Supply Board or other State institutions who are in charge of monitoring this issue have overlooked it so they cannot find out what happened to the money collected from the public. The protesters say they have to travel two to three kilometres in search of drinking water. They added that they also have to travel four kilometres to Nikahetiya village to take a bath. Most villagers are daily wage coolies and it is very difficult for them to take a wash in the evening, find water for their daily chores, and find water for schoolchildren, and everyone is greatly inconvenienced. They said this situation has arisen because the water provided by the Water Supply Board comes through a community-based organisation. They also demand that a responsible person intervenes and resolves this issue. It is stated, in 2019, Rs 45,000 has been collected from one family and Rs 20 million has been given by the Government. The protesters say, while Rs 1.36 million has been allocated for water meters, this organisation collected Rs 2,000 each from 374 houses. When the Chairperson of the Prajamula organisation, Chandrika Herath, was queried about this allegation, she differed to the Treasurer. The Treasurer, Dissanayake said due to the increase in electricity charges and water bills, he was unable to pay those bills. However, these protesters said due to the delinquency of a few persons, about 4,000 villagers are suffering. They also demanded a formal investigation and restoration of the water supply.

Great Potential The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is competing with four countries for the World Expo 2030, including Russia, South Korea, Italy, and Ukraine. The host country will be elected at the 173rd General Assembly of the BIE in November 2023, using a secret ballot based on the principle of “one country, one vote.” The Kingdom has received significant international support, with over 85 countries supporting its bid. Many International organisations have announced their support for Saudi Arabia’s bid. The Kingdom’s plans to host the “Expo 2030” are ambitious. Riyadh city is building one of the world’s largest public transport networks, creating a green space in the city which is four times larger than the “Central Park” of New York City, planting 15 million trees, and transforming Riyadh into an open art gallery without walls. Hosting the exhibition aligns with the Saudi vision of becoming a global investment powerhouse, diversifying its economy away from oil and embracing sustainable high-tech industries. The Kingdom is also launching large projects like NEOM and the Red Sea project to achieve this goal. Era of Change Saudi Arabia submitted its bid adopting a theme, namely “The Era of Change: Together (in our planet) for a Foresighted Tomorrow”. The International Bureau of Exhibitions (BIE) is set to host a World Expo in Riyadh, marking a significant milestone for the Kingdom. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz expressed confidence in the Kingdom’s ability to hold a historic version of the Expo, focusing on innovation and providing a unique global experience. He emphasised that the Expo would enhance the BIE’s role as a platform for understanding cultures and human exchange, reflecting the changing nature of the world. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz expressed confidence in the Kingdom’s ability to hold a historic International Expo, focusing on innovation and providing a unique global experience. He expressed confidence in the Kingdom’s commitment to organising the event. He also added Expo will coincide with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 celebration, marking the culmination of efforts to achieve the vision’s goals. The Expo will provide a unique opportunity to share lessons and results from the Kingdom’s transformation, focusing on reducing oil dependence, advancing economic diversification, and developing public service sectors like health, education, infrastructure, entertainment, and tourism. Forecasting the future The Crown Prince emphasised the Kingdom’s vision for the future, focusing on creating a sustainable future for future generations. The Kingdom launched a promotional campaign on 28 March 2022 to host the World Expo, utilising its diplomacy machine to mobilise international support. The Royal Commission for Riyadh City, responsible for developing Riyadh, is leading the bidding, and hosting efforts for Expo 2030. The city has become one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, with a population of nearly 8 million people and a GDP of up to US$ 200 billion. The city is developing numerous projects to transform Riyadh into one of the 10 largest urban economies in the world and an ideal candidate for hosting the World Expo. By 2030, Riyadh aims to embody the World Expo’s aims of bringing together the best minds, ideas, and solutions to continue the progress of humanity. Exceptional version The Kingdom is working to organise an exceptional version of the World Expo with the International Bureau of Exhibitions. The mission of the BIE paid a five-day visit to Riyadh to discuss the Kingdom’s dossier for hosting the event. The delegation met with Prince Muhammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Crown Prince, Prime Minister, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Royal Commission for the City of Riyadh. The mission also discussed technical aspects of the Kingdom’s candidature dossier for World Expo 2030, holding meetings and workshops with Ministers and senior officials. Experts in the exhibitions, conferences, and festivals sector believe that the Kingdom’s structural capabilities, tourist destinations, and experiences in various events confirm its ability to host the “Expo 2030” exhibition. The success of annual celebrations, exhibitions, and events in Saudi Arabia, such as book fairs, festivals, and international sports championships, as well as initiatives like the Green Middle East initiative and the Saudi Green Initiative, support the Kingdom’s candidacy and give preference to its submitted dossier over other countries competing to host World Expo 2030.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Abeywardena also expressed concern about the spread of false information on social media regarding a complaint, contrary to facts. The UNP Chairman strongly condemned certain groups for making baseless allegations to confuse the public. He emphasised that as long as these practices persist, Sri Lanka’s future will remain uncertain. MP Abeywardena was speaking at the UNP Ambalangoda electorate working committee meeting held on Saturday (24). He highlighted President Wickremesinghe’s efforts in engaging in bilateral and multilateral discussions with influential countries to revive Sri Lanka’s economy, which has been impacted by the ongoing crisis. Abeywardena expressed confidence that many of these efforts are starting to yield positive results, and he firmly believed that Sri Lanka would soon regain its former glory. According to Abeywardena, several countries, including Sri Lanka’s friendly nations, are looking at Sri Lanka with optimism and are providing assistance to overcome the economic crisis. “President Wickremesinghe has already taken significant steps, with the support of powerful countries such as the United States, India, China, and others, to transform Sri Lanka into a developed nation. It will be difficult to find a leader in Sri Lanka who can engage with the international community as effectively as President Wickremesinghe,” Abeywardena said. He added that although mistakes have been made in the past, it is now time to rectify them and move forward. He emphasised the importance of working together, focusing on the future generations who will eventually take over the country, rather than attempting to gain political mileage. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

It is alleged that the names of Samurdhi beneficiaries have been unfairly excluded from the Aswasuma lists, while names of new individuals, who were not Samurdhi recipients, have been included instead. In the Kirindiwela Grama Niladhari Division, in Balangoda, out of 352 Samurdhi beneficiaries, only four names have reportedly been included in the Aswasuma programme. Similarly, numerous Samurdhi beneficiaries in Ampara have also been left out of the Aswasuma list. The people claim that despite assurances from the authorities that the names of those suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) would be included in Aswasuma, many affected families have been omitted from the new programme. This issue became a heated topic during last week’s parliamentary sessions, as both government and Opposition MPs joined forces to criticise the selection process for the welfare programme. However, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe tweeted that individuals can personally submit their appeals and objections regarding the Aswasuma welfare benefits programme at the Divisional Secretariats throughout the country. “For those who are unable to use the online system to submit their appeals or objections, they can file them in the usual way.

ALPGSL Secretary, Captain Manil Abeyaratne, highlighted that SriLankan Airlines presently has only 250 pilots, whereas a minimum of 330 pilots are required for the airline to operate at full capacity for designated flights. Over 70 pilots have resigned and more resignations are pending due to unresolved issues, exacerbating the shortage of flight crew. In a statement, the ALPGSL said additionally, during the Covid-19 pandemic, pilot salaries were slashed by approximately 50 per cent. The ALPGSL stated that prior to June 2023, pilots were being paid their salaries at an arbitrary USD value, capped at rates significantly lower than those set by the Central Bank. Initially, the rate was Rs 188, then Rs 225, and subsequently Rs 295 (since December), which was 40 per cent below the Central Bank rate. “Despite the salary cuts, the pilots continued to work diligently during the pandemic, contributing to the airline’s revenue generation. They played a crucial role in transporting critical medical supplies and fulfilling other essential requirements for the country during the crisis. It is worth noting that all pilots employed by the airline have funded their own education and training at SriLankan Airlines,” it said. “Over the past year, over 70 pilots have resigned from the airline, resulting in a severe shortage of pilots. This shortage was evident in a recent incident where no pilots were available for standby duty, leading to a flight departing over 12 hours after its scheduled departure time,” ALPGSL said.  "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2023/06/26/dengue-cases-likely-to-increase-with-coming-monsoon-dr-wijewickrama/,Dengue cases likely to increase with coming monsoon– Dr. Wijewickrama,Author not found,0,2023-06-25T20:33:00+00:00,"Senior Consultant Physician Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama warned that with the upcoming monsoon season, there is a risk of dengue cases increasing rapidly and he urged that dengue control needs to receive more attention from all sectors. During an interview conducted by the President’s Media Division recently, Dr. Wijewickrama emphasised that everyone’s assistance is important for this because neither the Government nor the Health Authorities can control the dengue virus on their own. “There has been a clear increase in the number of dengue cases this year and over 47,000 cases have been reported since January. The majority of the patients recorded thus far are from the Colombo and Gampaha Districts and the Health and Security Forces will work together to launch a special initiative to clean up the garbage in those areas,” he said. Dr. Wijewickrama said 75% of reported cases involve those who are older than 15 years of age. “Nowadays, young people are more likely to contract the disease than small children, despite the fact that it used to spread among them more frequently. Dengue is a virus. As a result, there is a strong likelihood that dengue can be easily transmitted via mosquitos from one infected person to another,” he said Eliminating mosquito breeding places is vital. The dengue mosquito typically exists in in areas where clean water gathers. Anywhere, including waste plastic, used tires, flower pots, coconut and king coconut shells, serves as a breeding ground for dengue mosquitoes. Such areas should receive as much attention as possible and should be removed immediately. In addition, precautions should be taken to avoid mosquito bites, he pointed out. Furthermore, it is important to take precautions against mosquito bites in order to avoid spreading the dengue virus to others. For that, the body should be covered with clothing. Additionally, there are mosquito repellents. It can also control mosquito bites. But none of these approaches is completely effective. “The Local Government authorities, Public Health Inspectors, Health Departments and Security Forces have all stepped in to help control the disease by destroying mosquito breeding grounds. Special programmes are being implemented focusing on the provinces where dengue is spreading most. Within the coming week, a special initiative will begin, with a focus on the Colombo and Gampaha Districts, where the majority of cases are reported. There will be a clean-up of the garbage in such areas. It has been agreed to provide the labour contribution of the Army for this purpose,” he said. Even if water is removed from containers, mosquito larvae can remain. Therefore, they should be cleaned thoroughly and water should not be allowed to collect again. The typical lifespan of a mosquito is five to six days. Therefore, weekly cleaning of the surroundings is crucial. Keeping your surroundings clean is a must. Controlling dengue cannot be done by one person alone. And it cannot be done only by a few institutions. This requires the support of everyone in the country. Moreover, a person suffering from dengue should not work hard and rest is essential. “If not, the chances of complications are high. Any patient with fever should only be given Paracetamol, it has been advised. Paracetamol may occasionally fail to entirely bring down fever. However patients should not be afraid in such cases. Having a fever does not escalate to a major issue. Complications can be minimised through physical rest. Meanwhile, it is vital that fluid intakes are given to patients to keep them hydrated. King coconut water, orange, lime juice and Jeevani are generally recommended for this purpose,” he advised the public."
