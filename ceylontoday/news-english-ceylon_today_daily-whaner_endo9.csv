https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/10/12/nfis-to-stock-market-enjoy-31-month-high/,NFIs to Stock Market Enjoy 31-Month High,Author not found,0,2022-10-11T20:30:00+00:00," Net foreign inflows (NFIs) into the stock market passed the Rs 15 billion mark yesterday, by registering its highest NFI in 14 calendar days, a figure of Rs 828.5 million, thereby recording a cumulative NFI total of Rs 15,271.7 million to hit at least a 31-month high (April 2020) due to sustained confidence by foreign investors in Sri Lanka’s financial markets, sources told Ceylon Today. Complementing these developments, the stock market enjoyed NFIs for 21 consecutive market days to yesterday, also not seen for the past 31 months. Nonetheless, the stock market fell to a 43 calendar day low, with the ASPI declining for the third consecutive market day to yesterday, led by local investors exiting from the bourse in favour of the fixed income market, driven by higher rates, complemented by record-high inflation. Consequently, the ASPI, yesterday over Friday fell by 3.37 per cent to 8,744.61 points and the S&P SL 20 Index by 4.29 per cent to 2,652.99 points on Rs 3.04 billion. Meanwhile, the S&P last registered a lower figure than that of yesterday 69 days ago on 3 August 2022. A total of 91.32 million shares changed hands yesterday. Monday was a holiday for markets. The benchmark, albeit administered ‘spot’ closed unchanged for the seventieth consecutive market day at Rs 360/364 to the US dollar in two-way quotes yesterday (Tuesday, 11 October), market sources told Ceylon Today. Consequently, yesterday, the administered market ‘spot’ was down by between 80-79.31 per cent (Rs 160-161), year-on-year (YoY) in two-way quotes, thereby causing cost-push inflationary pressure, as Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy, they said. Meanwhile, yesterday, the value of this official administered ‘spot’ was fixed at Rs 362.90 to the dollar, while a year ago it was fixed at Rs 200.40, down 79.30 per cent (Rs 160.50), YoY. In related developments, the straitjacketed, inflexible administered market ‘spot’ a year ago was fixed at Rs 200/203 to the dollar in two-way quotes, unchanged for the twenty third consecutive market day to 11 October 2021. The band in which the guided market ‘spot’ may currently operate is fixed at +/- 3 per cent of the officially administered ‘spot’ value, where the latter is applicable for transactions involving the GoSL, CBSL, and/or between the GoSL and/or CBSL with the market, which was fixed at Rs 362.90 to the dollar yesterday. They further said trades in the administered market ‘spot’ (Rs 360/364) on Friday were mainly restricted to ‘bank-client’ outright trades, while the interbank foreign exchange (FX) market was however dominated by swaps, which were outside the domain of the FX market for this purpose. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and of its foreign reserves also deals in ‘spot.’ By Paneetha Ameresekere"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The President pointed out that to build a developed economy and raise Sri Lanka to the pinnacle of the world, a solid Economic Policy as well as political stability is a must. Hence, he invited everyone to join hands to discuss the National Policy framework using the National Council as a platform. He was speaking while declaring open the first life-saving pharmaceutical manufacturing plant established in Sri Lanka yesterday (10). The President also pointed out that he is working towards establishing a national policy to prepare an export economy using competitive and modern technology. Expressing his views further, the President said, “First let me congratulate the Chairman of this company. He is a farsighted individual. He had a good understanding of the drug shortage the country is facing.  He also understood that the local market is insufficient. Therefore, this company has taken steps to develop our export industry, not only to supply medicines needed domestically, but also by producing medicines needed internationally. We sincerely hope that this project commenced by this young entrepreneur will progress to greater heights. This project has created great employment opportunities for many. This investment has been done at a time when the country’s economy is facing its hardest period.  Our budget deficit is one factor that has contributed to the collapse of our economy. The foreign exchange we receive is not sufficient to meet our needs,” he said. Speaking further he said, “therefore we have to obtain loans every year. Currently, we are in a situation where we are unable to pay our debts. Our economy must be rebuilt. If we are to succeed we must remember one thing. We must earn the required foreign exchange. A deficit of foreign exchange cannot be maintained. It is not possible to maintain a budget deficit. Our aim should be to keep the surplus of the expenditure head. For this, we need to increase our foreign income. For that purpose, the goods produced for export, the crops grown and the services provided should be increased. We need an export-oriented economy that uses the most competitive technology,” he said. Wickremesinghe said, all should follow one national policy. “We can engage in our daily debates. However, we need to make one national policy. If we continue with that national policy, we will never fail. We made the mistake of changing policies with every change of government. Even when the ministers changed within the government, the policies were changed. So how can you expect the country to prosper?” he questioned. He also said, there should be a good social framework as well as a political framework and the economic framework depends on the stability of the political framework. If a stable political system cannot be established, the people of the country will suffer."

Chairman of the NCPA, Udayakumara Amarasinghe, while noting there were an increased number of incidents reported to them on children being taken to public protests in the past few months, urged parents and elders not to risk children’s lives by engaging them in such protests. He also said, the NCPA will take the matter seriously and will look into it as a special case as this trend of using children as ‘human shield’ is on the rise. The Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) lodged a complaint with NCPA yesterday (10) against police brutality on children during a protest on 9 October at Galle Face Green. The complaint was based on a video footage that showed a 16-year-old child being arrested by the Police at the protest on 9 October. The footage also showed a mother being dragged away from her child. CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin, addressing the media after lodging the complaint, yesterday (10) noted that the child was arrested for filming the protest. “Even children were admitted to the Lady Ridgway Hospital for children after this incident. If the NCPA is a public body which really works on behalf of the safety of children they should look in to this immediately,” he added. Stalin inquired whether this is how the Police were taught to treat and handle children. NCPA Chairman Udayakumara Amarasinghe said, the NCPA would look into the incident.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/10/11/health-professionals-warn-of-strike-over-retirement-age/,Health professionals warn of strike over retirement age,Author not found,0,2022-10-10T20:30:00+00:00," The Federation of Health Professionals (FHP) warned they would resort to trade union action if the retirement age limit was extended only for one particular profession in the health service. Convener of FHP, Ravi Kumudesh, in a letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, yesterday (10), alleged that the Cabinet subcommittee was considering a Cabinet Memorandum recommending the extension of the retirement age limit for medical practitioners despite the policy decision taken by the government to make 60 years the maximum age limit for retirement. In a letter copied to All Ministers of the Cabinet Sub Committee, Secretaries of the Ministries of Finance Ministry, Public Administration and Ministry of Health, He said, “We strongly condemn the move to ignore the commitment our professionals made towards overlooking our personal needs in a bid to solve the country’s economic crisis and strongly emphasise that if changes are made, the same privilege must be given to our members.” He warned that the AHP was prepared to take trade union action if any decision was taken in favour of one profession. If all professions in the health service are not treated equally, trade union action will be initiated against the recommendations given by the relevant Cabinet Sub Committee or Cabinet decision. Kumudesh called for the immediate intervention of the President as it was difficult to imagine that the Cabinet Sub Committee or the Cabinet itself would give a fair decision. Therefore, “your direct and prompt intervention is necessary to prevent unnecessary trade union action,” he said. Meanwhile, the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS) lamented that there was a significant shortage of medical specialists in the country with nearly 45 per cent of specialist posts being vacant in the State health sector which would be further aggravated by retirement of 249 specialists on a single day.” AMS President, Dr. LakKumar Fernando, issuing a statement earlier, said that the 299 doctors who were ideally expected to return after the foreign training in 2023, could never be expected to fill the void created by proposed retirement of 249 senior medical specialists on 31 December 2022, due to the reversal of retirement age to 60 years. Citing reasons he said that all those doctors would not return to Sri Lanka in the month of January 2023 but would arrive throughout the year 2023. Some of them have left over local training and cannot be appointed even as acting consultants on arrival, he lamented.  It was very unlikely that all those doctors would return to the country with the current economic crisis prevailing here. While, some of them would return to quickly go back to overseas. These doctors would not become full board-certified consultants just on arrival to Sri Lanka as they have to fulfil other requirements for Board Certification such as submission of research and passing the Pre-Board Certification Assessment. They cannot become Post Graduate trainers, examiners or board of study members for some time. He said that moreover, the vacancies created by the retirement of 249 medical specialists due to reversal of retirement age to 60 have to be filled by the transfer mechanism of the ministry of health and it will obviously take considerable time to apply, select and attend to appeals and approval of the PSC, he noted.  Dr. Fernando warned there will be more difficulties in finding replacements for those specialists moving from periphery to centre should the policy be implemented.

A senior officer, who was part of the investigation, said that Khan had left Sri Lanka about three days ago in an illegal vessel hired by a family of five in Mannar. As they were nearing the fifth islet near Arichalmunai, there were gun shots mid-sea. Sensing trouble, Khan jumped off the vessel. When the family of five reached the Mandapam shore on Friday, they were clueless about him. Rameswaram fishermen spotted the youth swimming and alerted the Marine Police who brought him ashore. According to Khan’s statement, his parents lived in Kuthupattu, a refugee camp in Puducherry, while a few relatives lived in Ramanathapuram. As he could not survive in Sri Lanka, owing to the economic crisis, he fled the island nation to join his parents and look for a livelihood in Tamil Nadu or Puducherry. However, the security agencies were baffled by his statement. They were keen to get his identity checked with the Sri Lankan Police. Hence, Khan was detained at the Mandapam station. The officer said that as and when the verification process was over, he would be handed over to officials of the Mandapam Rehabilitation Camp, where about 175 refugees have been staying since March.  (The Hindu)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Accordingly, the Inspector General of Police (IGP) has been informed to provide a report on the matter within 24 hours, the HRCSL said. A peaceful protest and commemoration had been organised at Galle Face Green to commemorate those who lost their lives during the ‘Aragalaya.’ However, a large number of Police officers had been deployed and their intervention before the commemoration caused a heated situation at the scene. Five persons, including a 15-year-old child, was arrested and the child was later released. The other four persons were produced before the Fort Magistrate’s Court and released on personal bail in Rs 500,000 each. A toddler was admitted to the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children in Borella on Sunday (9), when Police tried to use force to remove the protesters. Meanwhile, President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), President’s Counsel Saliya Peiris warned the Police officers saying that those who act on illegal orders must remember that someday they will have to pay for their illegal activities. “I have seen Police officers who engaged in unlawful acts and violated the rights of people in order to satisfy their bosses, having to pay for their misdeeds. Some paid by way of compensation and loss of their promotions. Others had to face jail terms after being found guilty of criminal acts,” he said, writing on facebook. “When these things happened, their masters were nowhere around to protect them and they had to face the music alone. The wheels of justice may grind slowly but they will surely grind,” he added. BY Methmalie Dissanayake"

He also said a referendum will be called to decide on the parliamentary electoral system, if the Select Committee which is proposed to be established, fails to reach a decision on the matter by July next year. He made these observations during a discussion with a group of professionals held at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday (09). The President said that the desired changes to the political system should be brought about in accordance with the aspirations of the people, as the majority of the population in the country rejects the existing political system. He said further that the executive power of the Pradeshiya Sabha should be vested on a chairman-based committee instead of same being vested on a single chairman. Laws will be drafted for this amendment before the next LG election. Pointing out that the main cause of political corruption is the Preferential Vote System, the President also said the country should immediately switch to a list-based electoral system withnon-preferential votes or a mixed system (single and proportional system). Limitations should also be imposed by the election law on the money spent on election propaganda. Following are excerpts of the President’s statement: There are two main issues before the country today. One is the economic collapse while the other is the rejection of the political system by the majority of the population. Many are of the view that the cause of the economic collapse is the existing political system. As we have discussed at length the measures to be taken to revive the economy, I would not intend to talk on it any longer here but we should focus our attention instead on the political program. Today, the political system of the country is questioned by the majority of the people and they demand all 225 members to be dumped into the Diyawanna Oya. It is not because of individuals but because of the political system that is rejected by them. It was not the political parties that initiated the protests last March. The people did not participate in protests by the political parties but they came forward independently. Unfortunately, by May and June, different political organizations took this movement into their own hands and then the violence crept in. Along with the violence they attempted to oust the government and the struggle collapsed with it. Still the people are of the view that the existing political system should be changed. Everybody rejects violence. And we have had to accept it and have to move forward changing these attitudes. Different groups have been formed within the Parliament due to the party system. It is not a secret that I was supported by the ruling party to be elected as the President.  A few voted with other contestants. Opposition members too voted in my favor. SJB as well as members of the Tamil parties too voted in my favor. Hence, I was supported by both sides. I work for the people irrespective of narrow party lines. Currently, in accordance with the opposition’s request, a Parliamentary National Assembly has been established. In addition committees such as Monitoring Committees too have been established. But these have not yet been completed. Some participate in the National Assembly and some don’t. The country expects everyone to work together. We should not end here. We should consider the people’s aspirations and should act accordingly. As the People are fed up with village level politics, we accept a new concept today. It is not the government but former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who recommended the Jana Sabha System. To unite the public organizations in that village level and working in one committee is what Janasabha is all about. This system which existed before as Gramodaya Mandala is commendable. However, the Gramodaya Mandala had a connection with the government whereas the Janasabha has not. We hope to implement this public assembly program. There should be proper coordination with the Pradeshiya Sabhas during the functioning of the Jana Sabhas (Public Councils). The Pradeshiya Sabhas will not be allowed to remove the Jana Sabha. We need to plan how we will work together. There are many questions about the Pradeshiya Sabha system. Many of these Pradeshiya Sabhas do not even make a profit. They are sustained on tax money. Municipal Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas that receive money utilize it to pay salaries. Hence, we have to think about this system. However, last time we increased the number of Pradeshiya Sabha members from 4000 to 8000. This was not what the people asked for. This was done following discussions between the party leaders. Now, we have to reduce this number back again to 4000 prior to the next election. Therefore, let’s work to amend those laws in the parliament. Let’s start this program from there. And there is another urgent amendment. The Chairmen of these Pradeshiya Sabhas are the executive heads. Some people are against it. Before the Pradeshiya Sabha system, there was no such power when there were Municipal Councils and Village Councils (Gam Sabha). Therefore, I propose to entrust the executive power of these Pradeshiya Sabhas toa  chairman-based committee instead of a single chairman. The head of it would be the Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman. Now there are finance committees. Let’s create such an executive committee. We need to accomplish these two things before the next local government elections. I would like to specifically mention that it is something we must do. We have informed the ministers to prepare the necessary draft law. Similarly, many people are not in favour of this preferential system. No one thought of the preference system initially. J.R. Jayawardena, after much thought, proposed the list based electoral system in 1975, which was accepted by other parties. Because it was based on ratios. Accordingly, we held the Urban council elections and the Municipal Council elections. We continued this system successfully. However, in 1988 the parties in parliament suddenly took a decision to bring in the preferential system instead of the list system. Moreover, not just one preference, but three preferences. It was further decided to increase the number of members of parliament from 196 to 225.  The main reason for corruption in this country’s politics is the preferential system. Hence, we need to prepare a new voting system. A decision should be taken to implement either the list method without preference, or the mixed method (single and proportional method). A decision should be taken after discussions before the upcoming election and that election should be held under the new system. Then, the suitable people would be elected. This is something that we have to do. Today there is no agreement among the parties. The main parties are told one thing and the minor parties are told another. We cannot progress in this manner. The political parties need to take a decision in this regard. I discussed this matter with the Justice Minister as well. We will propose a parliamentary select committee to decide on the parliament voting system. That committee has to convene and discuss the matter. This matter cannot be delayed because by July next year a decision should be taken. Failing which, I will opt for a referendum to seek public opinion on which electoral system is preferred. People will be informed about this and discussions will be held about these methods. They can then discuss and choose one method. Therefore, the Parliament Select Committee should finish the activities entrusted to them. If not, I will leave it in the hands of the people to do the work. We can’t escape from these responsibilities. We must move on. A lot of money is spent on elections today. I voted the old way back in 1977, spending was limited back then. Today, some people spend 20-30, 50 million per election. How do we repay these? Members of Parliament have been imprisoned by this method. Therefore, we need to curtail the election expenditure through the election laws. When I contested the 1977 elections, there were limitations. We had to work in keeping with these limitations. We were unable to even spend on posters. Hence, we must introduce limitations on election expenditure. Another factor is that there is no youth representation in our political parties today. Many work with the same old people just for namesake. There are no new organizations. Therefore, a separate law should be presented regarding the constitution of political parties, their work, how to recruit members, how to select central committees, and how to select candidates. Currently, countries like Germany have laws called the Political Party Law. We should also act accordingly. There are rules about how to collect money, what are the cases where money cannot be collected. Then you can work transparently. Anyone can go to court against it. Because there is transparency, and because election expenses are limited, the parliaments of those countries give money to political parties. Money is also given for elections. It is better to give from Parliament and not from private institutions. They have imposed restrictions. Even America has this system. Therefore, we should also bring in this system. I intend to appoint a separate commission to present their proposals in this regard. All this needs to be done next year.  With a new economy, there must be a new attitude. Also, some people lay blame that action is not taken against MPs. Action can be taken against MPs if they have flouted disciplinary laws. I will present to Parliament the code of conduct and values of the MPs, similar to that in the British Parliament. Parliament needs to approve it. In England, there is a Parliamentary Standard Act, if it is not acted upon, it will be reported. When they report it, they have to leave because of popular opinion. No other step can be taken. Recently, one MP was removed from the debate. If we bring all these rules and regulations, if we make these amendments, we can win the people’s trust. Then many people will go and vote in the next election. We can expect around 85% voter turnout. We need to change attitudes. There is no point in going on protest marches in the old-fashioned way. Now what is happening is that political parties have started leaning on the protest struggles to get public support. But, these protest struggles are not dependent on political parties. We have to bring rules and regulations according to the opinions of the people and give them the opportunity to appoint people who they want elected to parliament. This is the work that we should do in the future."

He confirmed this when he arrived in Kandy on 8 October to notify Mahanayake Thera of Malwatu Asgiri Ubhaya Maha Viharaya of the decision. In an address to the media, Ratnayake said because sacred places conduct public activities such as Dhamma schools, including them under the public function is not a problem. “The electricity tariffs in sacred places have increased by 550 per cent, according to the method of increasing the electricity tariffs implemented on 8 August. The PUCSL has notified the Ceylon Electricity Board to name places of worship and charities under the general purpose tariff system, effective 8 August, and charge the relevant rates accordingly  it will be reduced proportionally,” he said. He expressed confidence that the Mahanayaka Theras and other religious leaders would accept the new system. “Approximately 48,000 institutions, including religious places, are registered under the charity category, and some of them are registered under it because of the electricity bill concession,” he said. In addition, he told the prelates that money will be taken from the treasury to provide more relief to sacred places’ electricity bills, and that a programme based on foreign aid will be implemented to establish renewable energy systems for sacred places. He added that since the programme’s implementation, there will be no increase in the electricity bills of temples and sacred places and there will be no need to keep the sacred places in the dark.

The publication titled‘Protecting the Poor and Vulnerable in a Time of Crisis’, further said that the underlying tensions are further elevated by perceived weak governance, corruption and elite capture, it said. The impact of severe foreign exchange liquidity constraints is being felt across the economy, particularly from the second quarter of 2022, with shortages of fuel, food, cooking gas, and inputs needed for the agriculture and industry sectors, the WB said. And, without market access, Sri Lanka continued to service its external debt and pay for imports using official reserves and financing from the domestic banking sector.  Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s six-month road map (presented in October 2021) did not raise funds as envisaged, the WB said. Leading to this situation, years of fiscal indiscipline and risky commercial borrowing had led to high public debt and debt service, it said. As a share of GDP, the public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt rose from 78.6 per cent in 2017 to 109.7 per cent in 2021. As a result, Sri Lanka became one of the most highly indebted developing nations (86th percentile) and Government of Sri Lanka’s financing needs continue to be among the highest in emerging markets, the WB said. Official reserves went down from US$ 7.6 billion in 2019 to less than US$ 400 million (excluding a currency swap equivalent to S$ 1.5 billion from China that has specific conditions for its use) in June 2022, it said. Net foreign assets in the banking system also deteriorated to $ – (minus) 5.9 billion in June 2022. (PA)"

The WB, in a publication titled ‘Protecting the Poor and Vulnerable in a Time of Crisis,’ said weak export competitiveness has been hampering Sri Lanka’s export growth for two decades. It further said, among the reasons behind the retardation in Sri Lanka’s export growth was because the country has become a more inward-looking economy since the turn of the century, which shows in the ratio of trade to GDP falling from 88 per cent in 2000 to 39 per cent in 2020. During the same period, exports as a share of GDP fell from 39 to 17 per cent. “WB estimates Sri Lanka’s missing exports at USD 10 billion annually, almost as high as the present level of merchandise exports,” it said. The increasing gap between actual and potential exports is driven by a combination of an overvalued real exchange rate and trade policy frictions that increase costs of trading, as well as the benefits of selling domestically, the WB said. Sri Lanka’s import duty levels are among the highest in the world and the structure is also complex, with multiple para-tariffs and various exemption schemes. The current account deficit averaged 2.8 per cent of GDP between 2012 and 2021 due to large trade deficits despite strong remittances and tourism flows, it said. Continued monetisation of fiscal deficits and episodes of loose monetary policy created further macroeconomic imbalances, the WB said. These imbalances, combined with pre-Covid tax cuts in 2019 contributed to unsustainable debt and, as a result, Sri Lanka lost access to international financial markets in 2020 due to credit rating downgrades, the WB said. Despite rising foreign financing needs, an overvalued exchange rate, increasing trade and investment barriers, and a complex business environment created an anti-export environment, slowing down the growth of export earnings, it further said.

The poorly regulated nature of the country’s essentials markets leave poor households vulnerable to sudden price hikes, the WB added. The real value of the benefit amounts has been progressively eroded by inflation, rendering it even more inadequate relative to the needs of the beneficiaries, the WB warned.  Benefit amounts are fixed in nominal terms and adjusted only occasionally (usually prior to elections), it added. There is also evidence that tailoring the benefit amount according to need could help improve the poverty reduction impact of social protection, the WB said.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The President made this observation while making a special statement in Parliament yesterday (6), regarding the current economic situation. He invited all parties to join the country’s rebuilding programme irrespective of their personal grudges of the past.  The President, introducing a fourfold strategic plan to recover from the crisis, said that the first step has already been successful. The foundation is being laid to make the second step a success. “I pointed out those facts even before I assumed duties in the office of Prime Minister. I reemphasised the same after assuming duties in the office of Prime Minister. I pointed it out again when I presented the policy statement to the Parliament after assuming the office of President. “We have made the first stage successful and the preparations at the foundation level to make the second stage a success are being made. Under such a situation we got the opportunity to exchange our views with the State leaders. In addition we had the opportunity to meet the Finance Ministers of 68 member countries of the Asian Development Bank, in Manila. During these meeting I too got the opportunity to discuss with the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong. The free trade agreement we inked with Singapore was not functioning properly in the past. If we are able to re-enact this agreement, the benefit the country would enjoy would be enormous. “This agreement will also be instrumental in strengthening our economic ties with Southeast Asia. The Prime Minister of Singapore expressed confidence that through the implementation of this agreement, it will be possible to obtain a stable economic approach with Sri Lanka. “I also had a dialogue with representatives of Japan International Cooperation Agency and Japan International Cooperation Bank. The representatives of both the institutions assured their support to expand investments in Sri Lanka. “I also met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. During the discussion, we focused on a number of important issues affecting our two countries. In addition, discussions were held with the Japanese Foreign Minister as well as with the Japanese Finance Minister. “Japan’s agreement to play a leading role as a mediator in the debt restructuring process of Sri Lanka is a good sign. Due to some recent incidents, the goodwill between Japan and us had been strained. We strived hard to re-strengthen the bonds with Japan during the past few months. Now we have a green light from them. We persevere to restore the friendship we had with Japan earlier. “We have already commenced the preliminary discussion with China. Following the Chinese Communist Party convention, we will recommence the discussions with China. It is very significant that Japan has agreed to mediate to discuss the debt restructuring program with China.  China has been supporting us since ancient times and we hope they would do the same at this critical juncture. “Our discussions with India are in progress. I briefed the Sri Lanka’s current situation to Indian PM Modi in Japan. We pay our gratitude to India and Prime Minister Modi for their support extended during the difficult time in the recent past.  We have a positive response from Modi to overcome the economic crisis. “Sri Lanka hopes to come to a common agreement with creditor nations including Japan, China and India. We also commenced dialogues with Ambassadors from other countries, which have already provided loan facilities. Our expectation is to bring them into a multilateral common agreement. He also said Sri Lanka has sought the assistance of the International Development Association to get concessional financing as the nation can no longer afford commercial borrowings. “We have requested the International Development Association to assist us to get concessional financing as Sri Lanka currently lacks credit worthiness to borrow on market terms from World Bank or any other institution. Countries such as Egypt had followed a similar strategy when their nation suffered economic downturn in the past,” he added. “We also seek US$ 1 to 2 billion as bridge financing from institutions such as Asian Development Bank and World Bank. We have already in a position to get US$ 500 million from ADB,” the President said. “Sri Lanka’s economy will recover by the end 2023 while the rupee would also stabilize by that time. However we have to take steps by informing the public on the status of the nation. We will have to stop printing money. However it has been possible to steady the inflation and keep it at 69.7% in September. However it is essential to restructure state enterprises which run at a loss. Total losses of State enterprises such as Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and SriLankan Airlines will exceed Rs. 4,000 billion by the end of this year. We cannot make the people bear this huge burden anymore. We have already embarked on restructuring these enterprises,” he stressed. “We also have to increase the tax revenue to 14% of GDP. It is currently 8% of the GDP,” he said."

He said MPs from both the Government and opposition have requested him to transfer or promote specific policemen. Responding to a question raised in Parliament by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Hesha Withanage, yesterday, Alles said he receives a number of such requests and that there has even been one from an opposition MP yesterday. “I will not carry out any transfer or promotion under political pressure or on any transfer or promotion based only on such requests. Just because a politician makes a request a policeman will not be transferred or promoted. Transfer or promotion can be carried out only if it is approved by the Public Service Commission (PSC). When Withanage inquired about the claims previously raised by the Inspector General of Police, Minister Alles noted that a transfer could only be done after obtaining the approval of both the Police Commission and the PSC. “Therefore, politicians can’t do what they want. All qualifications are checked manually and approval is given that way,” he added. Responding to a question raised by Withanage regarding the actions taken on a triple murder in Minuwangoda, Alles noted that the murders are connected with drug smuggling and the underworld. “Drug smuggling and the underworld go together. In the past, when drugs come into this country, they also come with weapons. We have identified that some of them are led by people living abroad. Many of these killings happen when they quarrel over their share of the money they earn from smuggling drugs and the revenge killings continue,” he added. He also noted that he can give complete detailed statements of the murders that have taken place in the past three months. BY Nabiya Vaffoor"

The resolution that was adopted yesterday had only seven voting on behalf of Sri Lanka which is the lowest at the Council so far. The resolution was adopted by 20 countries namely:   Argentina, Armenia, Czech, Finland, France, Germany, Honduras, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malawi, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Montenegro, Germany, Netherlands, Paraguay, Poland, Republic of Korea, Ukraine, UK and Northern Island, and the USA. The implications are that all the provisions of the resolution have now been adopted and the Council will monitor Sri Lanka as recommended and the special office on Sri Lanka accountability project will be enhanced and strengthened. The UNHRC will continue to monitor Sri Lanka and report on the progress at the next sessions in March and June orally and in writing in September next year. Economic monitoring has also been adopted for action against corruption and the Council will also monitor the human rights impact on Sri Lanka’s economic decisions.  The government argued that the UNHRC cannot dictate economic reforms and that they have no mandate to do that.  Last year (2021) the UNHRC passed resolution 46/1 and the Government of Sri Lanka rejected it outright citing that the resolution adopted to set up a mechanism in the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) to collect evidence of war crimes and the number of countries that voted for the resolution stood at 22 in favour of the resolution, while 11 rejected the resolution and 14 abstained.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Reportedly, former Secretary to the Ministry of Tourism Siripala Hettiarchchi authorised Wijesinghe’s appointment as the DG for SLTDA in March 2020 but This was not approved by the Public Services Commission and Wijesinghe overstayed her two-year tenure. A media conference was held to clarify this yesterday.   Following her resignation, Wijesinghe was appointed as the Ministry of Defence’s Additional Secretary. She was previously the Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Education, where she was on secondment until being appointed to the SLTDA. On the other hand, Viyathmaga member and former Chairperson Kimarli Fernando, who stepped down after criticising the newly appointed Tourism Minister for not scheduling a meeting with her, criticised Wijesinghe’s ‘removal’, with whom she closely collaborated during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Fernando resorted to social media to remark, “A corrupted system lost a qualified and honest public servant from the tourism industry. A sad day for Sri Lanka Tourism.” Fernando wrote on Facebook that she had the honour of working with Wijesinghe. “It is blind leading the blind and personal agendas! They are absolutely clueless, visionless and incompetent. Public servants have now been deprived of speaking out whereby politicians are able to bully and torment honest public servants whenever they do not comply with their will. Real system change will be demanded by the citizens,” her Facebook post said. The current Secretary to the Ministry of Tourism, Chulananda Perera, refuted the criticism, stating that Wijesinghe was appointed to the SLTDA when her post of Additional Secretary remained unfilled and she was paid the salary of an additional secretary, which was overlapping because the Ministry of Tourism does not require another additional secretary.

The problem of education, fuel and energy, nutritional issues, collapse of tourism industry are only some of them,” he said. “The economic debacle has led to increasing inflation and reduced purchasing power. It has become a big challenge for people to meet their food and nutritional needs. Because this situation has been prevalent for so long, pregnant women, infants, and children are vulnerable to malnutrition. Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella recently said there was a risk of malnutrition in the future due to the change in the diet brought on by high inflation.” Dr. Aluthge said his outfit had anticipated this situation, and presented proposals comprising six steps to resolve the nutritional problems in the country. There was urgent need to rectify the lack of scientific and accurate data regarding the present nutritional status in the country. The Ministry of Health has started implementing a nutritional data collection programme. “It is noteworthy that October is ‘National Nutrition Month.’ Our most important proposal was that an inter-stakeholder mechanism should be prepared by bringing together all parties to provide long-term solutions to the food and nutrition problem by analysing the data obtained in this way,” he added. The GMOA Secretary further said two weeks ago, under the leadership of the President, the National Mechanism was established, and its regional committees have been appointed. He said the decisions taken through those programmes and discussions would be implemented immediately at the grassroots level. (DJ)"

The detection was the outcome of a joint exercise by PUCSL, IT and Department of Weights and Measures. The move followed after the PUCSL on Tuesday said samples will be collected from all fuel stations countrywide for a quality survey after receiving complaints from many consumers. Noting that over 1,200 fuel stations are in the country, PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said, if they receive 100 complaints from 100 places it translates to around 10% of the stations having low-quality fuel."

Yesterday’s (5) data will be known only today (6). The last time RE provided over 50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs for at least 66 consecutive days was from 5 October 2021-15 December 2021, covering a period of 72 consecutive days, where RE met over 50 per cent of the island’s electricity needs. On Tuesday, the cheapest of CEB’s generation costs, ‘CEB Hydroelectricity,’ a unit of RE, alone, met 51.92 per cent (21.08 gigawatt hours (GWh)) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity needs (40.6 GWh),while RE as a whole provided 61.92 per cent (25.14 GWh) of the island’s total electricity needs on that day. However, in the 277 calendar days that have transpired in the calendar year to Tuesday, RE was responsible for providing 50 per cent or over of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs in only 116 (41.88 per cent) days and the expensive and imported pollutive fossil fuels (FFs) in the balance 161 (58.12 per cent) days, respectively. In related developments, of the total electricity supplied by the CEB to consumers in Sri Lanka on Tuesday, FFs total share was 15.46 GWh (38.08 per cent). Tuesday’s FFs breakdown comprised CEB Coal 11.93 GWh and CEB Fuel Oil 3.53 GWh, respectively. Meanwhile, Tuesday’s total RE breakdown comprised CEB Hydro 21.08 GWh, followed by PS Mini-Hydro 1.95 GWh, PS Wind 0.89 GWh, CEB Wind 0.82 GWh, PS Solar 0.28 GWh and PS Biomass 0.12 GWh, respectively. ‘CEB’s Hydro’ breakdown of Tuesday comprised Mahaweli 11.68 GWh, equivalent to meeting 55.41 per cent of total ‘CEB Hydro,’ Laxapana 7.38 GWh (35.01 per cent) and Samanalawewa, that is, both Samanalawewa and Kukule Ganga hydroelectric power projects (HPPs) together, 2.02 GWh (9.58 per cent), respectively. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s 2021 Annual Report, the cheapest source of electricity generation to the CEB last year was ‘CEB Hydroelectricity,’ costing a mere Rs 1.67 a unit or per one kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity, followed by Coal (Rs 10.68), non-conventional RE such as Mini-Hydro, Wind-both CEB and PS, Biomass and Solar (Rs 16.22), ‘CEB Fuel Oil’ (Rs 32.03) and ‘PS Fuel Oil’ (Rs 30.35), respectively. ‘Mahaweli Hydro’ comprises Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe, Kotmale, and Upper Kotmale HPPs, respectively. Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe, and Kotmale HPPs were built during the J.R. Jayewardene era after obtaining grant and concessional aid from the West. Upper Kotmale, conceptualised during the Jayewardene era, was built during the Mahinda Rajapaksa era, after obtaining concessional Japanese aid. Samanalawewa, conceptualised during the Jayewardene era, was built during the Ranasinghe Premadasa era, after obtaining concessional aid from Japan, and Kukule Ganga, conceptualised during the Premadasa era, was built during the Chandrika Bandaranaike era after obtaining concessional aid from Japan. Laxapana, built during the D.S. Senanayake era with Sri Lanka’s own money, was subsequently extended after obtaining concessional World Bank aid. However, Sri Lanka’s sole coal electricity generator, the 900 mW Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, built by the Chinese after obtaining a mix of  foreign commercial and concessional loans during the Mahinda Rajapaksa era sans tender call and incurring USD 1.35 billion of taxpayers’ money to build it, is generally, only partially operative for several days, forcing the Government of Sri Lanka/CEB to be overreliant on the expensive fuel oil to meet a large size of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs on most days. But due to a US dollar shortage in the country led by corruption exemplified during Rajapaksa’s near-10 year tenure in office, from 17 November 2005 to 8 January 2015, Sri Lanka has no US dollars to import not only the cheap coal to provide power to the country 24 hours a day, but also diesel to operate a regular bus service, whilst also aiding and abetting socioeconomic unrest in the country. In Sri Lanka’s 74 year history of independence, never once did expensive Government foreign commercial debt (GFCD) as a percentage of total Government foreign debt (GFD) exceed 7 per cent other than during the Rajapaksa era. GFCD, which was a mere 4 per cent of GFD when Rajapaksa took office in 2005, hit a record 28 per cent in 2009, before reaching a record 51 per cent in 2012 and staying that way since. An example of GFCD is the above malfunctioning coal plant. During this period, IMF’s Resident Representative to Sri Lanka, Dr. Koshy Mathai (2009-2013), warned the Government of excessive GFCD, but his warning fell on deaf ears. By Paneetha Ameresekere"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Abeywardena said countries such as the US, Japan and some others have come forward to lend a helping hand to resolve the country’s economic crisis, and that is the duty of every citizen to support President Wickremesinghe at this time. While speaking to the media in Galle, Abeywardena said President Wickremesinghe’s goal is to transform Sri Lanka into a developed nation in Asia and to bring it to the forefront of the world’s developed countries. “Japan was also one of the countries that assisted us greatly in the past. However, they abandoned us during the previous administration. President Wickremesinghe’s visit to Japan was intended to repair the decades-old relationship,” he said. According to Abeywardena, “We can now regain their support”. “Following the Covid-19 pandemic and Ukraine war, people across the world have been severely affected. The fuel and gas issue which sparked off as a result of the Ukraine war cannot be reconciled. There is a need to explore the possibilities of working together in collaboration for  unity and achieving sustainable development in the Asian region”, Abeywardena said. President Wickremesinghe met leaders of various countries across the world, Governors of Central Banks of those countries, state officials and politicians to discuss of Sri Lanka’s current economic progress under his administration during the 55th AGM of the Asian Development Bank held on September 29, MP Abeywardena added.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/10/06/ceb-deprived-of-rs-1-13b-enhanced-generation-profits/,CEB Deprived of Rs 1.13B Enhanced Generation Profits,Author not found,0,2022-10-05T20:30:00+00:00,"The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was deprived of enhancing its electricity generation profits by Rs 1,131,099,913 (Rs 1.13 billion) in the eight consecutive days to Tuesday (4 October) due to the breakdown of the Norochcholai Coal Fired Power Plant (NCFPP) at least since last Tuesday (27 September), CEB data from yesterday (5) showed. Yesterday’s (5) generation data will be known only today (6).  Consequently, CEB data showed that in the eight-day period from Tuesday, 27 September 2022 to Tuesday, 4 October 2022, CEB made a total electricity generation profit of a mere Rs 1,562,064,900 (Rs 1.56 billion) due to at least one of three of CEB’s coal fired machines at Norochcholai being out of order during the reference period. However, if NCFPP was fully functional, CEB, in the reference period will have made a generation profit nearly double that figure, a sum of Rs 2,693,164,813 (Rs 2.69 billion). If NCFPP is fully functional, the cheaper coal run NCFPP has the capacity to produce a maximum of 40 per cent to meet Sri Lanka’s daily electricity generation needs, as all three coal machines at Norochcholai are capable of providing 3X300=900 mW of electricity power when fully functional. But due to the breakdown of one of its machines, on Tuesday alone, NCFPP provided a mere 29.38 per cent (11.93 gigawatt hours (GWh)) of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs on that day, with the balance met by a combination of the cheap and clean renewable energy (RE) 61.92 per cent (25.14 GWh) and the more expensive fuel oil 8.69 per cent (3.53 GWh), respectively. However, if the NCFPP was fully functional, there would have been no necessity to burn the more expensive fuel oil to provide electricity to Sri Lanka on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Sri Lanka consumed a total of 40.6 GWh of electricity, according to the CEB. All calculations are based on CEB’s generation costs and tariff charges as per Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL’s) 2021 Annual Report. It discounts, CEB’s 75 per cent tariff hike effective from 9 August 2022. According to CBSL’s 2021 Annual Report, the most expensive raw material required to generate electricity is ‘CEB fuel oil,’ which cost the CEB Rs 32.03 a unit (one kilowatt hour (kWh)) last year. The next was private sector or independent power producers’ fuel oil (Rs 30.35), followed by RE excluding ‘CEB hydroelectricity’ (Rs 16.22), ‘CEB coal’ (Rs 10.68)-the second cheapest, while the cheapest was ‘CEB hydroelectricity’ at Rs 1.67 a unit, respectively. According to CBSL, CEB’s average tariff rate last year was Rs 16.37 a unit. The above calculations also discount CEB’s transmission and distribution losses estimated at 8.72 per cent last year. If, CEB was providing the country uninterrupted power, unlike the record daily power cuts it has been subjected to, since last year, that would have further eaten into CEB’s generation profits due to an additional consumption of the expensive fuel oil, that is, more than the present requirement. Meanwhile, one of three of the NCFPP ‘coal’ machines which broke down last Tuesday (27 September) was set right on Saturday (1 October). Nonetheless, another ‘coal’ machine has been out of order for more than three months, that is, at least since 27 June, leaving only one ‘coal’ machine totally functional, unbroken, since 27 June to Friday, 30 September, before the second machine which broke down on 27 September was fixed on 1 October. At present, only two of three NCFPP machines are functional, whereas if all three machines were functional, NCFPP has the capacity to provide 900 mW (3X 300 mW) of electricity power. The construction of NCFPP started in 2011 with the commissioning of its first 300 W machine that year and it was completed in September 2014 at a cost of USD 1.35 billion. Built by the Chinese, in a mix of commercial and ‘concessional’ loans taken from them sans international tender call during Mahinda Rajapaksa’s Presidency, since the commissioning of its first machine in 2011, NCFPP has been malfunctioning, forcing Sri Lanka to burn the expensive fuel oil to meet the country’s electricity needs.

Vegetable prices will continue to fall in the next few weeks, according to Christie Wijeratne, General Manager of Dambulla Dedicated Economic Centre. Wijeratne said in the coming months, vegetable prices will dip and at present there is a slight drop, however, most of the vegetable prices remain the same. He told Ceylon Today that even last week, the variety of vegetables was around 400,000 kgs, and this week, close to 1 million kgs of vegetables have arrived at the Centre. All in all, normalcy prevails at the Economic Centre, and buying and selling vegetables is steadily increasing, he said. He said if vegetable yields grow, prices will fall, which he expects to happen in the next few weeks. He believes that the distribution of chemical fertiliser, petroleum, and gasoline two months ago helped increase vegetable production. “There are no longer waits, and more vehicles and traders are arriving at the Economic Centre to purchase vegetables and fruits than two months ago and beyond,” he told Ceylon Today. The Covid-19 pandemic, chemical fertiliser ban, lack of fuel and cooking gas caused misery to vegetable producers in Sri Lanka, which led to major political unrest.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/10/06/re-meets-over-50-of-electricity-needs/,RE meets over 50% of electricity needs,Author not found,0,2022-10-05T20:30:00+00:00,"Cheap and clean renewable energy (RE) led by ‘Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Hydroelectricity’ provided over 50 per cent or more of Sri Lanka’s (SL’s) electricity demand for 66 consecutive days to Tuesday (4 October), after 293 days, CEB data from yesterday (5) showed. Yesterday’s (5) data will be known only today (6). The last time RE provided over 50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs for at least 66 consecutive days was from 5 October 2021-15 December 2021, covering a period of 72 consecutive days, where RE met over 50 per cent of the island’s electricity needs. On Tuesday, the cheapest of CEB’s generation costs, ‘CEB Hydroelectricity,’ a unit of RE, alone, met 51.92 per cent (21.08 gigawatt hours (GWh)) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity needs (40.6 GWh),while RE as a whole provided 61.92 per cent (25.14 GWh) of the island’s total electricity needs on that day. However, in the 277 calendar days that have transpired in the calendar year to Tuesday, RE was responsible for providing 50 per cent or over of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs in only 116 (41.88 per cent) days and the expensive and imported pollutive fossil fuels (FFs) in the balance 161 (58.12 per cent) days, respectively. In related developments, of the total electricity supplied by the CEB to consumers in Sri Lanka on Tuesday, FFs total share was 15.46 GWh (38.08 per cent). Tuesday’s FFs breakdown comprised CEB Coal 11.93 GWh and CEB Fuel Oil 3.53 GWh, respectively. Meanwhile, Tuesday’s total RE breakdown comprised CEB Hydro 21.08 GWh, followed by PS Mini-Hydro 1.95 GWh, PS Wind 0.89 GWh, CEB Wind 0.82 GWh, PS Solar 0.28 GWh and PS Biomass 0.12 GWh, respectively. ‘CEB’s Hydro’ breakdown of Tuesday comprised Mahaweli 11.68 GWh, equivalent to meeting 55.41 per cent of total ‘CEB Hydro,’ Laxapana 7.38 GWh (35.01 per cent) and Samanalawewa, that is, both Samanalawewa and Kukule Ganga hydroelectric power projects (HPPs) together, 2.02 GWh (9.58 per cent), respectively. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s 2021 Annual Report, the cheapest source of electricity generation to the CEB last year was ‘CEB Hydroelectricity,’ costing a mere Rs 1.67 a unit or per one kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity, followed by Coal (Rs 10.68), non-conventional RE such as Mini-Hydro, Wind-both CEB and PS, Biomass and Solar (Rs 16.22), ‘CEB Fuel Oil’ (Rs 32.03) and ‘PS Fuel Oil’ (Rs 30.35), respectively. ‘Mahaweli Hydro’ comprises Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe, Kotmale, and Upper Kotmale HPPs, respectively. Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe, and Kotmale HPPs were built during the J.R. Jayewardene era after obtaining grant and concessional aid from the West. Upper Kotmale, conceptualised during the Jayewardene era, was built during the Mahinda Rajapaksa era, after obtaining concessional Japanese aid. Samanalawewa, conceptualised during the Jayewardene era, was built during the Ranasinghe Premadasa era, after obtaining concessional aid from Japan, and Kukule Ganga, conceptualised during the Premadasa era, was built during the Chandrika Bandaranaike era after obtaining concessional aid from Japan. Laxapana, built during the D.S. Senanayake era with Sri Lanka’s own money, was subsequently extended after obtaining concessional World Bank aid. However, Sri Lanka’s sole coal electricity generator, the 900 mW Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, built by the Chinese after obtaining a mix of  foreign commercial and concessional loans during the Mahinda Rajapaksa era sans tender call and incurring USD 1.35 billion of taxpayers’ money to build it, is generally, only partially operative for several days, forcing the Government of Sri Lanka/CEB to be overreliant on the expensive fuel oil to meet a large size of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs on most days. But due to a US dollar shortage in the country led by corruption exemplified during Rajapaksa’s near-10 year tenure in office, from 17 November 2005 to 8 January 2015, Sri Lanka has no US dollars to import not only the cheap coal to provide power to the country 24 hours a day, but also diesel to operate a regular bus service, whilst also aiding and abetting socioeconomic unrest in the country. In Sri Lanka’s 74 year history of independence, never once did expensive Government foreign commercial debt (GFCD) as a percentage of total Government foreign debt (GFD) exceed 7 per cent other than during the Rajapaksa era. GFCD, which was a mere 4 per cent of GFD when Rajapaksa took office in 2005, hit a record 28 per cent in 2009, before reaching a record 51 per cent in 2012 and staying that way since. An example of GFCD is the above malfunctioning coal plant. During this period, IMF’s Resident Representative to Sri Lanka, Dr. Koshy Mathai (2009-2013), warned the Government of excessive GFCD, but his warning fell on deaf ears. By Paneetha Ameresekere"

As a result, the price of 12.5 Kg domestic gas cylinders will be reduced by Rs 271. The retail price of a 12.5 Kg gas cylinder will now cost Rs 4,280. The 5 kg gas cylinder will be reduced by Rs107, with the new retail price being Rs1,720. The price of a 2.3 gas cylinder will be reduced by Rs 48, where the new retail price will be Rs 800. Following the new features added to the existing gas price formula, the Finance Ministry, Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA), Presidential Secretariat and Litro Lanka collaborated to revise prices, a spokesman said. He stated that the price reform would be based on the newly introduced price formula based on global prices. “As a company, we want to pass on the benefit of the global price decrease to the general public. Litro gas has reduced its prices three times in the last three months. The upcoming taxes will have a 100 percent impact on our company, but by lowering our operational and total costs, we expect to pass the savings on to customers,” the spokesman added. Speaking further, he said given the previous months’ shortage of Litro Gas and the sudden price hike, several Litro Gas customers had withdrawn from using LP gas but now that prices have been reduced, e customers could resume normal use.

In a special statement to Parliament yesterday (5), he said the Government’s suppression of the public’s freedom of expression and protest amounts to State terrorism.  “SJB does not condone violence in any way, and we question whether there is no space in this country for peaceful protest,” he added. Premadasa also explained the importance of conducting a normal investigation if they are charged. “Activists Mudalige, Ven. Galgama Siridhamma Thera, and Hashantha Gunathilaka have been detained in Tangalle for more than 48 days under the PTA. What went wrong for them? Mudalige was reportedly taken to the Malwana, Kalawana, and Navagamuwa areas at night. We have no idea what they are up to. Why can’t they do all of this during the day? These individuals have been charged with anti-state crimes. What exactly does anti-state mean? Do the people of this country not have the right to protest, speak out, and hold meetings?” Premadasa queried. He said, detention orders have been issued for 90-days and further said this is a terrible situation as no charge sheet has been issued against the detained persons as yet. “In the end, an incident will happen or they will fabricate an incident saying that Mudalige was shot dead when he tried to escape. At a time where the Geneva Human Rights Council has been paying attention to our country such scenarios can make things worse for the country country,” he added. Premadasa further said, as members of the Opposition they were cautious about such incidents but the Government has been turning a blind eye. BY Nabiya Vaffoor"

Sanhita Ambast, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, said: “The economic crisis has led to devastating consequences for the people of Sri Lanka. “For months, the people have been suffering from severe shortages of food and have struggled to access healthcare, while sky-high inflation has exacerbated already existing patterns of inequality. “The Sri Lankan authorities and the international community must act quickly to mitigate the widespread human rights cost of this crisis, which has cruelly stripped away people’s rights. “The international community must offer all possible financial and technical support to Sri Lanka while putting measures in place to protect marginalised groups from disproportionate harm.” The report details the recovery measures that Sri Lanka’s leaders and the international community must put in place to safeguard human rights in their responses to the situation, such as increasing the amount of international assistance, ensuring comprehensive social protection, and considering all options for debt relief, including debt cancellation. Between June and September this year, Amnesty conducted interviews with 55 people. They include: people in precarious employment; daily wage workers; those working in the fisheries sector and plantations; people from the Malaiyaha Tamil community, who are likely to be particularly impacted; public health workers; staff members from civil society groups, humanitarian organisations and international NGOs and individual experts. Life-threatening shortages of medicine and essential equipment are major concerns in Sri Lanka as the economic crisis deepens. From shortages of gauze, intravenous antibiotics and insulin to requests to re-use catheters or endotracheal tubes, the last few months have brought shocking challenges to Sri Lanka’s healthcare system. A healthcare worker has told Amnesty: “Nurses are drawing blood without gloves. This is dangerous for the nurse and the patient.” In some cases, people in need of healthcare supplies were advised to purchase medicine or equipment from private pharmacies, because government hospitals had run out of supplies. One doctor told Amnesty: “But not everyone could afford it. Those who couldn’t just went home and came back worse.” Fuel shortages have also rendered transport either unavailable or extremely expensive, making it difficult or impossible for people to access healthcare services, particularly those from the Malaiyaha Tamil community who live and work in plantations that are historically poorly served by essential services. Rising prices driven by inflation and reduced household income mean people are increasingly unable to meet their basic food needs. The Government of Sri Lanka, donor countries, and international financial institutions are in the process of putting programs and economic reforms in place to address the economic crisis. Amnesty is calling on these bodies to ensure that they meet their obligations under international human rights law by safeguarding the rights to health and adequate food in all aid agreements. The government of Sri Lanka and international financial institutions must also conduct human rights impact assessments before implementing economic reforms – it remains unclear as to whether these have been or will be conducted. The Sri Lankan authorities are also currently in discussions with creditors on restructuring the country’s debt. All options for debt relief should be considered, including debt cancellation, which would allow the Government to increase public investment in crucial healthcare and social protection systems. Any debt relief agreements must not undermine Sri Lanka’s ability to meet its human rights obligations. Reforms of social protection systems, meanwhile, must be carried out transparently and with meaningful participation of those who will be affected by the changes. The Government should also explore all options for accessing the maximum available resources to fulfil human rights obligations, including through implementing progressive, redistributive tax reform."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

He was responding to a question from the media at yesterday’s (4) press conference to announce Cabinet decisions. He said the Courts will give the confiscated marijuana to the pharmaceutical corporation because some local medicines are manufactured using marijuana. He noted that the Minister in charge of the matter had also informed the Attorney General about it and that it would be preferable if it was produced under a safe programme so that it was not a drug for export at all. He added that he had previously spoken about it and that it had been criticised both inside and outside Parliament. “This is not marijuana for intoxication, but there is a market for exports that are required for medicine. I believe it is critical for our country, which is experiencing a severe foreign exchange crisis, to begin the industry under a safe system to export the entire quantity, even if only a very small amount is not released to the local market,” he said. Similarly, large local pharmaceutical companies, that is, those that produce Ayurvedic medicines, which already bring in a lot of foreign exchange to our country, have continuously requested permission to use them as part of the medicines and the Government has provided them with certain quantities, he continued. “As far as I know, they are given to pharmaceutical corporations because they have been legalised as wrongfully confiscated by the Courts.” These regional medicines are made from hemp. So it’s a good idea to talk about it,” he said. BY Thameenah Razeek"

This statement is a positive sign Sri Lanka will regain the EU’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) provided to developing countries. At a time when the country is plunged into severe economic crisis the GSP+ is most important to resolve it and a pride to Sri Lanka,” according to Kongahage. While addressing the media at Sirikotha, Kongahage said that a large number of young men and women are employed in the industrial sector. “What is made in those industries are sent to the world market. President Wickremesinghe is shouldering the responsibility of strengthening the crisis impacted economy of this country amidst various obstacles”. “Meanwhile the Director of the World Bank had also said that Sri Lanka is gradually moving towards a right direction by strengthening the crisis-impacted economy.

PHU Leader MP Udaya Gammanpila has challenged anyone, who brings up arguments that the examination should not be postponed, to a TV debate with him and has said that he is ready to prove with facts that they are wrong and the innocent children are right. He said 8,000 children from 22 districts have come out in support of the petitions. “In addition, over 110,000 children have joined the Telegram group, which was formed in order to postpone the exam. As a result, the majority of children taking the exam have made this request. These children are not asking to be different,” he said. In an address to the media, he said the children taking the GCE Advanced Level examination face the greatest challenges in history. He noted that schools and tuition classes were closed due to the pandemic and that teachers were on strike for an extended period of time. “Fuel shortages caused transportation to be disrupted. The economic crisis caused problems in the homes. All of this has disrupted the children’s education. Both the students and the teachers informed us that they are unable to complete the curriculum in a large number of schools. The situation is even worse for children who appear for the second or third time,” he said. Gammanpila also said in 2018, the time it took to release the results from the date the examination was completed was 145 days. He stated that the next examination will take place 219 days after the results are released. “In 2019, the time it took to release the results from the date the examination was completed was 144 days. The next examination is scheduled for 290 days after the results are released. This time it will be 204 days and 278 days in 2020. However, in 2021, it takes 202 days to complete the exam and release the results, but only 98 days to prepare for the next exam. How unfair is it to give these children who have faced the most challenges the least amount of time to prepare for the exam?” he questioned. BY Thameenah Razeek"

Premadasa said that due to the high price of oil and fuel, the entire fishing community is facing serious problems. “Due to the rapid increase in the prices of fuel and other inputs required by the fishing industry, they are facing a severe crisis. Sri Lanka’s largest and cheapest source of protein, fish, is under threat at a time when child malnutrition is also on the rise. The crisis is further compounded by the Government’s failure to properly supply diesel and kerosene to nearly 4,500 multi-day fishing vessels and over 25,000 small-scale fishing boats. Especially due to the increase in the price of kerosene from Rs 87 to Rs 340, it has become very difficult for small-scale fishermen to earn a living and the shortage of seafood and high prices have become unbearable for consumers,” he added. Premadasa asked if kerosene will be provided to fishermen at the previous price or if they will be given a subsidy. He also inquired whether the Government is working to provide concessional prices for essentials like diesel and engine oil and what measures that have been taken to ensure steady supply of fuel to fishing vessels. “They complain that although there is a mechanism in place to compensate fishermen affected by the X-Press Pearl disaster, only a fraction had received payments. How much money is left for the fishermen? What is the next programme prepared to provide it?” Premadasa inquired. Premadasa noted that the previous government took steps to remove the fish ban imposed by the European Union on Sri Lanka, and as a result, fish exports increased significantly, and with the significant increase in the value of the US dollar, a significant increase in fish export income can be expected, but it is clear that the industry will not get that benefit due to slowdown in production. “Is the Government paying attention to this? What measures has been taken to distribute the income properly among the entire fishing community?” inquired Premadasa. Due to the impact on these sectors by power cuts, fuel supply disruptions and fuel price increases, the economic crisis in this country will have a significant impact in the future, he added.  “Will this Honourable Council be informed about the measures taken by the Government in this regard? What is the policy implemented by the Government to revive the fishing and fish production industry in the future?” He further inquired if the contributory pension scheme for fishermen has been implemented, what its current status and whether the Government have any plans to start a fisheries insurance scheme.

Sampath confirmed that the prices of the majority of food items have risen since the implementation of the Social Security Contribution Tax. “While we have not made a collective decision to raise the price of a lunch packet, most hotels have raised their prices by Rs 10, Rs 15, and Rs 20. Fried rice, Kottu, and other fast food items had seen price increases. The only relief we can provide at this time is to keep the price of a cuppa at Rs 30 under control. Some sell it at Rs 40, so we have asked the Consumer Affairs Authority to regulate it,” he added. Sampath further said that the Social Security Contribution Tax has caused many vendors to raise the prices of their goods, such as coconuts.

While appreciating the work of the Commission in releasing information in a large number of cases, they said if the trend of ignoring information requests by public authorities continues, the RTI Act will become of little use to citizens. The Commission responded by saying all specific instances of the RTI Act being abused should be brought to the attention of the Commission, adding that the Commission will inquire with force into the complaints. It was also observed that public authorities must conform to the provisions of the Constitution in releasing information in Tamil in the Northern Province and that the Commission will be inquiring into failure to respond properly in these instances. Marking the International Day for Universal Access to Information on 28 September, RTICSL held a series of discussions in collaboration with the District Secretariat of Jaffna, the Press Clubs of Jaffna, Mullaitivu, and Kilinochchi, and academics of the Northern Province on 28 and 29 September. During the meeting held at the District Secretariat of Jaffna presided over by the RTI Commission and District Secretary K. Maheshan together with divisional secretaries, public officials, and communities of the Province, the successes and challenges of implementing the RTI Act during the past five years were discussed. Orders delivered by the RTICSL that resulted in the release of information in a wide-ranging number of cases, from information in regard to land matters, governance issues related to management of public funds, the proper functioning of state bodies to exposure of corruption were focused on. Community representatives who spoke at the meeting pointed to the need for public authorities to function more efficiently in processing information requests. They also highlighted instances where they had been discouraged by certain public officials when using the RTI Act. The Commission emphasised the importance of public authorities giving information within the time limitations set out in the Act and said stern action will be taken if the timelines are disregarded or the Commission Order is not obeyed. Many requested the Commission to establish provincial offices to take the RTI message effectively to rural areas. On 29 September, extensive discussions took place with editors, editorial heads, and journalists of the Northern Province, where journalists pointed to the fact that some government officers do not have properly functioning information officers. Despite all the difficulties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the financial crisis, the Commission said citizens and journalists of the Northern Province are actively using the RTI Act. Though the Commission is not able to establish provincial offices islandwide due to a gap in the Act, the Commission has decided to increase holding provincial sittings islandwide. These are the third sessions held by the Commission in Jaffna during the past eight months. The Commission hopes to increase such activities in the future and is also conducting its regular appeal sessions in Colombo via Zoom, while accepting appeals through email to minimise difficulties faced by citizens in using the RTI Act."

The statement stated that the SLFP salutes all other political parties that did not participate in the National Council, and that the National Council is a fictitious committee that aims to indirectly obtain the approval of all parties representing Parliament for all of the Government’s decisions. In line with the SLFP’s position, the statement stated that the National Council proposal, which was recently added to the parliamentary agenda, should be debated, and that the National Council, proposed in the all-party government concept, is an alternative political structure to a Senate with executive power to manage the current crisis.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The event began with students of Gateway College, Colombo paying floral tribute to Gateway Group founder Mr. R.I.T Alles. Dr. Harsha Alles, Chairman of the Gateway Group, invited the children and teachers of C.W.W Kannangara College to accept 11 scholarships. In his address to the gathering, Dr. Harsha Alles noted that where so much has been said, certain things have been said through song and also put into practice by example. “This is what I will remember about this morning. My dear children, 90 years ago, our founder, Mr. R. I. T. Alles, chose to be born on 3 October, one of three major important days. There are three of them — Children’s Day, Elder’s Day, and Teachers’ Day. I am sure he did so out of love and respect for all three categories. You must learn about the great he has done for children. I am sure you know how close he was to his darling mother, as well as what kind of teacher he was and how he looked after his colleagues.” Dr. Harsha Alles added, “This morning, I would like to thank the organisers of this ceremony for continuing something close to his heart, ‘The Foster Parents Scheme.’ “I recall hearing about the Tsunami on 26 December, Boxing Day. My father was feeling uneasy the following morning because one of his teachers lived in Galle. We knew he was living in a house near the sea. I had heard that a member of the Matara computer branch staff had gone missing. “So we were both eager to go down South. We were not permitted to travel on 27 December 2004, but we did travel on 28 December 2022. The teacher was not at home when we arrived, but the adjacent property was C. W. W. Kannangara Vidyalaya. We took a quick tour and eventually found the teacher. Then we went to Matara and discovered that a member of the staff had been swept away by the waters. “Mr. R. I. T. Alles was talking to me on the way back, telling me that we needed to do something good. He could not have done better as an educator than to rebuild or restore a school. A large number of schools were destroyed. “On 29 December 2004, we made the decision to establish a small fund to assist the school. By 2 January 2005, we had named the fund ‘The School in Need’ and made it available to the entire Gateway Community. “We were not all that big. I recall a parent coming forward and donating Rs. 100,000 the moment we made this announcement. “When we asked him why, he replied, “You know, sir, I work in the travel industry and I travel on a lot of tourist buses. On 26 December 2004, while driving with my little girl in year 3, I received a call about what had occurred. Hearing the conversation my daughter said, “Thaththi, I think this is Tsunami,” Many of the adults had no idea what a tsunami was’. He was saying that he had done more than enough for Gateway College. So, all credit goes to our teachers, and the Daily Mail in the United Kingdom followed suit. Gateway College was the first school in Sri Lanka to be handed over after a year of reconstruction. We are constructing a lovely school. What can we take away from this, my children? Mr. Alles was someone who always wished for the best. Today’s schools are great. That is the result of a lovely dream. This is something Mr. Alles will teach you. “How can we show respect for such a great man? I believe we must adhere to his ideologies and teachings in order to shape ourselves into being better citizens. I am in this position because of this wonderful man and the lovely lady who came in this morning. We owe our gratitude to our parents. Without them, we are nothing. This is something you must remember as Gateway students. Mr. Alles had a great deal of respect for teachers. So nothing went wrong for a man who adored his parents and teachers.” Meanwhile, Gateway College Colombo Principal Vinita Shenoy said, “today (3 October) is a triple blessing day because we honour our founder, children, and teachers. This is the one day of the year when we honour, celebrate, and thank God for this wonderful man. “This wonderful person has liberated many young girls and boys from traditional mindsets and led them into the creativity of international schools. Gateway College is progressing and expanding in the manner that our founder would have desired. In his own words, the child who leaves this gate will be a confident, compassionate citizen with the ability to move around in society and the skills to survive in a complicated world. “To make this happen, we salute the greatest leader of all occupations, the teacher, who creates, shapes, and moulds all other students. You are a rainbow of possibilities, teacher. You must also leave a legacy. Every leader, past and present, has and will leave a legacy. So consider what it takes to leave an impression that will last long after you are gone. “The teachers, my team, my orchestra, each of you beautiful individuals, are the wind beneath my wings.” (Pix by Nuwan Amarawansha)"

Long-term policies, laws, and programmes that can successfully deal with the emerging problem are the need of the hour. I see the need for all of us to work together for the country. Remembering again the need to revise deeply to build a society with no one left behind and no gaps, I extend my heartiest greetings to the celebration of World Habitat Day 2022,” he said. The statement further said instead of regretting lost opportunities, only an awakening of attitude can be used to practice the future opportunities for the greater good. “Consequently, I invite you to celebrate the 37th World Habitat Day. It has been more than half a century since we gained independence. Many other countries in the region and the world that had a lower socioeconomic status than Sri Lanka have passed us. It is a challenging task to develop a country without long-term national policies that help to achieve sustainable development from an export-led innovative economy. With the upcoming 75th independence celebrations, in our next 25-year plan, we hope to build a society that will lead us to live happily in our own home with our beloved family.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts.

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

He was speaking at the 41st Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Logistics and Freight Forwarders Association (SLFFA) held recently. He said this is the plan for SriLankan Airlines and the civil aviation industry. “I am not saying that the government sector is useless. Many reforms are required. At the same time, we must strengthen the private sector,” he said. He said public-private partnerships are already showing results at the Colombo Port. “We are not jealous about that. But, the culture of our country in certain areas is that if somebody is making a profit, it should not be allowed. We should allow them to make money and then tax them. We should have proper tax policies. Some of the tax policies adopted in the recent past held back our country’s development. Now, we are changing them to allow the private sector to earn money and tax them.” He said simultaneously, the Ports Authority has to invest USD 75 million in the Eastern Terminal. “We have paid the first instalment for the cranes. We have a road map on how to obtain dollars and ensure that the ECT will also become a reality. That will help you all, because, unless the Government engages in this development work, the economy cannot be strengthened,” he said."

He was speaking at the 41st Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Logistics and Freight Forwarders Association (SLFFA) held recently. He said this is the plan for SriLankan Airlines and the civil aviation industry. “I am not saying that the government sector is useless. Many reforms are required. At the same time, we must strengthen the private sector,” he said. He said public-private partnerships are already showing results at the Colombo Port. “We are not jealous about that. But, the culture of our country in certain areas is that if somebody is making a profit, it should not be allowed. We should allow them to make money and then tax them. We should have proper tax policies. Some of the tax policies adopted in the recent past held back our country’s development. Now, we are changing them to allow the private sector to earn money and tax them.” He said simultaneously, the Ports Authority has to invest USD 75 million in the Eastern Terminal. “We have paid the first instalment for the cranes. We have a road map on how to obtain dollars and ensure that the ECT will also become a reality. That will help you all, because, unless the Government engages in this development work, the economy cannot be strengthened,” he said."

President Wickremesinghe left for Japan on 26 September and he attended the State funeral of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe yesterday (27)and thereafter met Foreign Minister Hayashi. Hayashi commended Sri Lanka’s progress with the IMF talks and expressed his country’s readiness to facilitate Sri Lanka’s international creditors, including China, Japan, and Indiain restructuring the current debt, which is a prerequisite for obtaining the IMF loan facility Sri Lanka is soliciting. The Sri Lankan Government sought Japan’s help to redeem Sri Lanka from the financial crisis and to hold talks with the creditors in order to obtain the IMF loan. During the conversation, President Wickremesinghe expressed regret over the breakdown of relations between Japan and Sri Lanka following the cancellation of several investment projects by the former Government. The President stressed that he was keen to restart those projects. Japan recently suspended 12 of its major projects in Sri Lanka, including the 17 billion yen Lotus Tower Transmission Project, as the country’s financial situation was deteriorating, besides the former government shelved Japan from developing the Eastern Container Terminal that was to be jointly operated by India and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and also terminating the Light Rail Transit (LRT) project for which Japan conducted the feasibility study.  President Wickremesinghe also indicated that the Government was interested in Japan investing in Sri Lanka’s renewable energy projects and exploring future investment opportunities in Sri Lanka, to which Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi pledged his assurance. The Japanese Foreign Minister also explained that Japan would begin the skilled worker examinations in January 2023 for Sri Lankan migrant workers. (SRM)"

Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said the maintenance work is estimated to be completed in 3-5 days. Owing to the situation, fuel power plants will be utilised to manage the power generation activities until the repairs are completed. In a tweet, Minister Wijesekera said, PUCSL has granted approval for the Ceylon Electricity Board to purchase power from Private Plants until Norochcholai Power Plant is restored and CPC will provide the necessary Diesel, Naphtha and Furnace Oil requirements to CEB to maintain the power generation without extending the power cuts. Meanwhile, he said, remaining Cargos from last year’s Coal Tender have been advanced to fulfil the immediate requirements of Norochcholai. Accordingly, the advance payment for the first Cargo was completed on 26 September. A Long Term Tender and a Spot Tender will be advertised this week for the full requirements. The Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant, also known as the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant (NCPP), has three main units that generate 900 Mega Watts. However, one of the units has been out of commission since 27 June, leaving only the other two units to supply 600 Mega Watts to the national grid. If fully operational, the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant (NCPP) can provide 40 per cent of the island’s electricity consumption. BY Thameenah Razeek"

JICA has decided to provide additional support to procure medicine under this project, responding to the serious medicine shortages in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is still facing serious shortages of medicine due to the ongoing crisis. Some hospitals need to suspend their surgeries because of lack of medicines and surgical equipment. The prices of medicines are rapidly increasing, which are mostly imported but unable to import because of the current situation in Sri Lanka. WHO says that the health care system at the national level suffers from shortage of 121 essential medicines as of September 2022. JICA hopes that the additional procurement of medicine contributes to mitigate the serious impact on the health services. Yamada stated that this emergency aid is to secure lifesaving medicines to be procured promptly, and JICA will carry out this support in close cooperation with MOH and other related parties from Sri Lankan side so that the medicines to be procured will reach people in need as soon as possible. The year 2022 marks the 70th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and Sri Lanka. The Government of Japan as well as JICA have been supporting the Sri Lankan healthcare system for a long time and will continue the cooperation in this sector for further upgrade of quality of medical services and the hospital system in Sri Lanka.

He added that order is contrary to what the Supreme Court held in the case of Vivienne Goonewardene v Hector Perera as per the judgment of Justice J.F.A. Soza in 1983. In this application, under Section 126 of the Constitution, the petitioner alleged that she was subjected to illegal arrest and detention in violation ‘ of Article 13(1) of the Constitution and to “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” in violation of Article 11 of the Constitution. Quoting the judgment in the case, Pieris said, “there was no legal basis for Sub-Inspector Ganeshananthan’s order to the processionists to disperse. The absence of a permit did not make the continuance of the procession an offence or any of the processionists liable to arrest. The petitioner and the others who were with her were well within their rights to ignore the order of Sub-Inspector Ganeshananthan to disperse. I might add that under Article 14(l)(b) of the Constitution the  freedom of assembly is a fundamental right guaranteed to all citizens.” State Minister of Defence Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon on 26 Monday said, Police or Security Forces must be informed at least six hours prior to holding any protest or demonstration. “The Government recognises and respects the people’s right to hold protests and rallies.

The remarks came after an ADB pact this month for an emergency loan of US$ 200 million to ensure access to food and protect livelihoods after months of shortages of key essential items which sparked protests that forced out the President. “As a key long-term partner, the ADB stands ready to provide further support,” the bank’s president, Masatsugu Asakawa, told reporters at its annual gathering. Sri Lanka’s economy has contracted and it is suffering from very high inflation severely affecting living standards, Asakawa said. The annual figure exceeded 70% in August.   “So, we are working closely with the government in supporting the country in this challenging time,” he added. Asakawa said, he was confident Colombo was working to finalise a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan of about $2.9 billion, by seeking financing assurances from creditors, among other steps. “After the IMF programme is completed, we will consider to join another, by providing additional financial resources to join other rescue packages for Sri Lanka,” said Asakawa, a former Japanese Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs. Asakawa pointed to the risks of abrupt capital outflows from Asia and the prospect of very sharp currency depreciation continuing for some time, as the U.S. central bank tightens monetary policy aggressively. However, Asia has become more resilient against financial turmoil, with an improved current account balance and sufficient accumulation of foreign reserves, than it was during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, he added. Yet portfolio capital movement is very fast and volatile, Asakawa said. “It’s always a good thing to be very vigilant on this broader capital movement,” he added. “I’m also trying to enhance our regional financial co-operation efforts, including that of ASEAN+3,” he said, referring to a grouping of China, Japan and South Korea with southeast Asian nations.

PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said Unit 3 was operational from 2 February to 26 September and that repairs on the unit will begin on 29 September for a 5-day period. In a media briefing yesterday (27), he said due to the breakdown, the national grid will be deprived of 270 megawatts. “This shortage must be addressed, and we are taking steps to do so. We are receiving naphtha and diesel. The power outage on Tuesday (27) was extended to three hours, but it will be reduced today (28). We received PUCSL members’ approval to go for emergency power purchase from the private sector, and adding other power plants will keep the situation under control,” he said. Furthermore, he said, only one unit is operational at the Norochcholai Power Plant at present, implying that only 270 megawatts are generated from the plant. Over 500 megawatts have been withdrawn from the national grid. He said, 900 megawatts from the plant is expected to be added within the next two weeks, allowing the three units to operate at full capacity. “The issue is that going for a power outage once a power plant fails is not a feasible option. Thus, political leaders and other responsible persons should pursue plans to build power plants,” he said. By Thameenah Razeek"

Dr. Jasinghe said the project, implemented by UNDP, allows all key institutions to realise the importance of collectively coming together to create one framework that strengthens national capacities in agricultural chemical management and healthcare waste management systems in Sri Lanka. Highlighting UNDP’s role in supporting waste management efforts in the health and agriculture sectors in Sri Lanka, Malin Herwig, Officer In Charge, UNDP in Sri Lanka, emphasized that, “The improper management of healthcare and agricultural waste has adversely affected the health of individuals working in the healthcare and agriculture sectors, communities and the environment at large while jeopardizing food and nutrition, which is a timely concern for Sri Lanka. The project serves to improve the regulatory framework on chemical management, strengthen national capacities in agricultural chemicals management, and support the transformation of healthcare waste management systems”. In line with this, a validation workshop was held on 15 September 2022 with over 70 participants to discuss and finalise key elements of the project with relevant stakeholders, and secure agreement and support for its implementation, to build a safe, clean and green Sri Lanka for all."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) will respond legally to the accusations pertaining to the quality of imported crude oil, Minister Wijesekera said. He said the CPC will legally respond to the accusations levelled by the PUChairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka in this regard. The Minister’s statement comes after Ratnayake claimed that the daily power cuts have been extended as Sri Lankan authorities have imported the wrong type of crude oil. In a tweet, the Minister said the CPC has adequate stocks of Diesel and Fuel Oil. Meanwhile, extended power cuts were requested by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), due to a breakdown at the Laxapana Hydro Power Station, insufficient funds at the CEB for diesel and fuel oil, and Hydro management, he added. An explosive allegation by the PUCSL Chairman on the quality of a recently imported crude oil consignment has led to a swift defensive action by the Minister. Ratnayake told a privately owned television station that the State-run CPC had imported the wrong crude oil with the wrong composition. Ratnayake claimed the unsuitability of the naphtha refined from this consignment with its high sulphur content was the reason for a recent extension of Sri Lanka’s scheduled daily power cuts from one hour and 20 minutes to two hours and 20 minutes. Meanwhile, addressing the Director General of PUCSL, Acting General Manager of CEB Dr. D.C.R. Abeysekarahas sent a letter stating that old Laxapana stage one has been made fully unavailable since 18 September 2022 and accordingly with restricted old laxapana generation, the CEB is compelled to curtail upstream WPS and downstream Polpitiya and Broadlands generation. “Under this condition, more than 60 MW of Laxapana complex generations has been lost. Further, Samanalawewa reservoir has already been depleted to 30 per cent of its capacity and it is essential to carefully utilise the Samanalawewa storage until the onset of monsoons,” the letter said. The letter also cited that the available coal stocks at present are sufficient only up to end of October 2022 as per the scheduled operation and availability of next coal stocks are still uncertain. “System Control Centre has elaborated and emphasised that the risk of excessive reservoir drawdown and fuel supply restrictions will result in extended demand management as the weather forecast received by them from metrological department shows a below average rainfall within the next three months. Further, during the meeting held on 06 September at PUCSL to discuss the Present Financial Situation of the CEB, it has been informed that the Commission decided to defer the decision on granting approval for procurement of emergency power from  ACE Power Embilipitiya (Pvt) Ltd, ACE Power Matara (Pvt) Ltd and Asia Power (Pvt) Ltd. Therefore, CEB in a position to purchase power from ACE Power Embilipitiya (Pvt) Ltd, ACE Power Generation Matara (Pvt) Ltd and Asia Power (Pvt) Ltd,” it said. BY Thameenah Razeek"

They warned it would have to request the President to take a strict decision against the Health Ministry hierarchy and other under qualified officials in his Ministry.  Issuing a statement Joint Conveners, Drs. Ajith Amarasinghe, Lakshman Edirisinghe, Chamal Sanjeewa, Jayaruwan Bandara, Hiran Karasinghe, Upul Rohana (PHIUSL) and Ravi Kumudesh (CMLSSL), inviting Health Minister, Keheliya Rambukwella to the emergency researches carried out by them at Medical Officer of Health (MoH) level so that it would help prevent officials from misleading him and creating further dilemma in the health service.  The Joint Conveners expressed absolute displeasure and disgust against Rambukwella’s efforts to mislead public representatives and the people through repeated statements in Parliament last week. “The NMHP would like to point out very clearly and with evidence that many facts issued by the Health Minister in the Parliament are scientifically untrue and misleading,” they said noting that it only serve to mislead the President, Parliamentarians and the public. “Past incidents have confirmed suspicions because we consider it a responsibility assigned to us according to the Constitution and Labour Ordinances to prevent the public from being misled,” they added. The Health Minister recently stated that the overall malnutrition rate in the Hambantota District was five per cent.  It will be very clear from official data of the Health Ministry, the Family Health Bureau and by Department of Population and Census Survey that the overall malnutrition rate in Sri Lanka is around 20 per cent and that in Hambantota district it was around 25 per cent.  According to the latest updated data, the percentage of underweight children has exceeded 40 per cent in many MOH areas in the Hambantota District. Thus, it is very clear that the Minister of Health has been misled by officials who present data based on political interest, they said. The Joint Conveners accused Health Minister Rambukwella of having failed during the last two- and- a-half years to import the latest cancer radiation therapy machines. To justify that situation, the Minister stated that it is appropriate to use cobalt radiation therapy machines, which are not even used when treating canines in developed countries, for cancer, they lamented. Many countries in the world removed the cobalt cancer treatment method by the 1980s because its efficiency and effectiveness were low and side effects it caused to patients was high. They said that to add insult to injury, the Health Secretary had allegedly been issued a letter restricting him from speaking to Trade Union leaders and the media. “It is a violation of the Constitution and the Labour Ordinance. Therefore, we hope to file a Fundamental Rights case before the Supreme Court in the near future,” the Joint Conveners said. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

Nonetheless, SLAgF recommended the ban of maize imports for the animal feed industry as a means of saving foreign exchange (FX), subject to the expected yield in the forthcoming Maha cultivation, it said. In an almost similar situation 45 years ago, when chicken prices then were controlled, the private sector asked the newly elected Premier J.R. Jayewardene to raise the controlled price of chicken, as maize prices in the global market had risen. They further warned Jayewardene, that if he doesn’t raise the controlled price of chicken, the consumer will have no chicken to enjoy his Christmas in 1977. Nonetheless, Jayewardene refused to accede to their request and instead, through ‘Sathosa,’ ordered 50,000 metric tons of chicken from China to ensure that there won’t be a shortage of chicken in the market. Meanwhile, SLAgF in their Friday’s statement further said maize seed imports have come to a halt due to the non-availability of FX. “The limited acreage cultivated cannot contribute sufficiently to achieve the expected maize harvest due to the non-availability of synthetic fertilisers and agrochemicals and it was noticed that yields dropped by 50 per cent – 60 per cent as a result,” they further warned. Consequently, consumers have to today pay Rs 1,300 per kilo for chicken and the price of an egg is in the range of Rs 50 – 60. Similarly, the price of liquid milk too has gone up drastically. Apart from the affordability, the availability of these products is becoming irregular, SLAgF said. To overcome these hurdles, it recommended allowing hybrid maize seed imports and providing required FX for the seed industry to address this issue. SLAgF also suggested encouraging farmers to grow maize in the coming Maha season. “The Government should offer incentives for maize farmers based on their yields.” “It was recommended to ban the import of maize for the animal feed industry as means of saving FX, subject to the expected yield of Maha cultivation,” SLAgF said. SLAgF in their statement also highlighted that the recent proposal to register maize cultivating farmers should also have a follow-up to support their cultivation with necessary inputs and assured markets and prices.

We need dollars to bring western medicine, but we do not need dollars to bring local medicine. Local medicines are made from plants native to our country. Why is the Government not promoting indigenous medicine? The Government has not implemented campaigns to promote local medicine.

He said teachers claim that students are hungry during school hours and many have not eaten for two meals. “There was an uprising recently as a result of the pressure caused by the oil and gas shortage. Of course, a lack of goods such as electricity, petroleum, and gas is not fatal. People did not have these items 200 years ago. People, however, cannot survive without food and medicine. Children are perplexed when their parents die without receiving medical treatment. Parents are perplexed when their children cry in hunger.

He said the Government should increase State revenue while decreasing expenditure. He noted that printing money means that the price of commodities will be increased again and again. At a press conference held yesterday (26), he said the maximum number of State sector employees should be about 800,000. But there are about 1.5 million employees in the State sector. “The youth in our country, who are unemployed, are protesting for jobs, which means we should create job opportunities. This has been a problem in Sri Lanka for decades. However, lowering the retirement age will result in an increase in government spending, not a decrease as people expect,” he claims.

He also said, following prolonged social unrest and protests in the country, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said he will implement social and political reforms requested by the nation and these measures include a review of the present procedures, the strengthening of the institutional framework of democratic governance and adoption of urgent measures to restore long-term economic stability. Sabry made these comments while addressing the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September, 2022 – New York. He said, it is envisaged that through the proposed legislative and constitutional amendments, democratic governance will be reinforced with independent oversight institutions as well as with enhanced public scrutiny. “Legal and administrative frameworks are being strengthened to ensure transparency, integrity, accountability and inclusivity in providing access to justice. A greater participation of women and youth will be ensured in this process. We remain cognizant of and acutely sensitive to the events that have taken place in the recent past. The Government is extremely sensitive to the socio- economic hardships faced by our people,” he said. Further, he noted Sri Lanka is pleased to have reached a staff level understanding with the IMF. He said the Government has put in place measures to protect the vulnerable segments of society and will endeavour to ensure that these economic reforms will have a minimum impact on their lives. “We unconditionally recognise the fact that one has a fundamental right to the freedom of expression, which we all treat as being sacrosanct. However, it must also be appreciated that, this freedom must be within the constitutional order, and must be exercised having regard to one’s fundamental duty to express oneself within the confines of the law,” Sabry said. He also said, Sri Lanka is paying serious heed to the warning signs that the world will not reach the scheduled milestones to achieve ‘Zero Hunger’ by 2030 as it is predicted that food and nutrition security will be at great risk."

Nonetheless, SLAgF recommended the ban of maize imports for the animal feed industry as a means of saving foreign exchange (FX), subject to the expected yield in the forthcoming Maha cultivation, it said. In an almost similar situation 45 years ago, when chicken prices then were controlled, the private sector asked the newly elected Premier J.R. Jayewardene to raise the controlled price of chicken, as maize prices in the global market had risen. They further warned Jayewardene, that if he doesn’t raise the controlled price of chicken, the consumer will have no chicken to enjoy Christmas in 1977. Nonetheless, Jayewardene refused to accede to their request and instead, through ‘Sathosa,’ ordered 50,000 metric tons of chicken from China to ensure that there won’t be a shortage of chicken in the market. Meanwhile, SLAgF in their Friday’s statement further said maize seed imports have come to a halt due to the non-availability of FX. “The limited acreage cultivated cannot contribute sufficiently to achieve the expected maize harvest due to the non-availability of synthetic fertilisers and agrochemicals and it was noticed that yields dropped by 50 per cent – 60 per cent as a result,” they further warned. Consequently, consumers to today have to pay Rs 1,300 per kilo for chicken and the price of an egg is in the range of Rs 50 – 60. Similarly, the price of liquid milk too has gone up drastically.  Apart from the affordability, the availability of these products is becoming irregular, SLAgF said. To overcome these hurdles, it recommended allowing hybrid maize seed imports and providing required FX for the seed industry to address this issue. SLAgF also suggested encouraging farmers to grow maize in the coming Maha season. “The Government should offer incentives for maize farmers based on their yields.”"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

He said, the Government’s approach were a series of illegal actions designed to suppress people who are under social pressure, such as farmers and industrialists. Muzammil told the Media yesterday (25) that some political leaders were attempting to create anarchy  under the guise of food riots in November and December, and that the Government should take immediate action to address the food shortage and prevent such a situation. He said, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, which speaks out on all social issues, did not object to the designation of High Security Zones in Colombo and instead expressed their concern. “If a Special Presidential Probe Commission is formed, everyone, including decision-makers and the public will have the opportunity to present any evidence they have.

Consequently, consumers to today have to pay Rs 1,300 per kilo for chicken and the price of an egg is in the range of Rs 50 – 60. Similarly, the price of liquid milk too has gone up drastically.  Apart from the affordability, the availability of these products is becoming irregular, SLAgF said. To overcome these hurdles, it recommended allowing hybrid maize seed imports and providing required FX for the seed industry to address this issue. SLAgF also suggested encouraging farmers to grow maize in the coming Maha season. “The Government should offer incentives for maize farmers based on their yields.”"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer.

The petitioners filed this case to prevent the construction of an elevated highway within an Environmental Protection Area (EPA) noting that the Thalangama tank and its environs were declared as an EPA under the National Environmental Act No.47 of 1980 (NEA), as amended by Gazette Extraordinary No.1487/10 dated 05.03.2007.  They said the said project is not a permitted activity under the NEA and Gazette No. 1487/10, adding that the 3.15 km of this elevated highway, of the Second Phase of the said project, would traverse the Talangama/Awerihena Wetlands, gazetted as an EPA. They added that no EIA has been prepared for the Second Phase, yet. ‘’This highway will also pave the way for noise pollution and emissions which will have a detrimental effect on the environment, hydrology and invaluable biodiversity of the wetland, as also on the air quality and health of thousands of inhabitants living on either side of the Thalangama/Averihena EPA as at present and generations to come,’’ the petitioners said.  The petitioners thereby sought a Writ of Prohibition against respondents from granting approval to construct the said elevated highway over the Thalangama Environmental Protection Area, to issue an interim order to maintain the status quo of the Thalangama EPA and suspend the road construction activities until the final determination of the application.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals.

The Opposition stressed that while schoolchildren are facing a severe food crisis and malnutrition, the Government has not been able to do anything to provide a balanced meal for the children so far. MP K.P.S. Kumarasiri said at least 20 children in three schools in Vilachchiya, Anuradhapura had fainted during school hours due to starvation. “It was reported on Wednesday (21), that a child in Minuwangoda had brought coconut kernel for lunch. This is a pathetic situation,” Kumarasiri said. In response, Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella said there have been several isolated incidents in that regard. However, some persons, together with media have given unnecessary attention to those isolated incidents. They are trying to generalise the issue, he added. “It is true that there is an issue. I accept that. But certain persons try to generalise such isolated incidents. We spoke to the Principal of that Minuwangoda School and other authorities. The reports about a child brining coconut kernel for lunch are not true. However, I will look into the incidents Kumarasiri mentioned,” he said. This is not the first time. Once, a doctor in Hambantota claimed that malnutrition was observed among 80 per cent of the school children in Hambantota. That claim too, was found to be baseless and inaccurate. The health officers in the area reported that only five per cent of children in Hambantota District are suffering from malnutrition, Rambukwella added. Joining in the conversation, SJB MP Harshana Rajakaruna told the Minister to admit the ground situation and find solutions without accusing officials, who are the messengers. “You should not shoot the messengers. Instead, you have to look into the reality in this country. This will be a long-term issue, if we fail to address in now. Children should be fed, before spending money on Cabinet and State Ministers,” Rajakaruna said. MP Dullas Alahapperuma said about 1.1 million schoolchildren have been affected over the past two years after the programme to provide free meals to schoolchildren was stopped.

Dr. Amarasuriya requested all teachers, lecturers and students in schools and universities to be sensitive on mental health and also to be especially sensitive about the social media role on suicide, depression and other mental health issues. Addressing the media yesterday (22), she lamented that the recent death of a student of University of Peradeniya was the third suicide incident reported from the university in past few weeks. She said that with the economic crisis in the country, some major issues have emerged in the education sector. She also claimed that students were facing difficulties in studies since the classes were conducted online due to the Covid -19. Currently, students are facing hardships due to the economic crisis in the country, she stressed. “Education has become something that pressures the parents, teachers and students. Education is not only exchanging information or casually sitting for the examinations. Social studies, personality development lessons must be provided through education. However, the education sector has also collapsed into a crisis and trust has also being broken,” Amarasuriya stressed. “It is reported that students are attending school without having meals and in some areas students are fainting at the assembly. We got to know that teachers are donating their food to the children,” she added. The Government is not showing any concern as to how the children are supposed to study in such an environment, she alleged. She said due to the economic crisis the teachers, parents, students, university lecturers are also pressured and that has a major effect on the educational system. “The Government is talking how they are going to reform the educational system while the whole sector is facing so many difficulties. The Government should be prioritising on solving these issues first,” she stressed. The mental health issues and the psycho-social crisis should be given a wide attention inside the educational system. The Government should understand the issues and intervene to solve these issues that youth of our country face, she said. BY Aloka Kasturiarachchi"

Both the MPs discussed many progressive ideas regarding period poverty and accessibility of menstrual hygiene products and legalising abortion and the importance of sex education. MP Kavirathna emphasised about promoting the use of condoms as part of safe sex practices. Meanwhile, responding to a comment by the host, MP Kavirathna also said there are many progressive discussions that take place in Parliament, yet parliamentary reporting is limited to the one or two mispronunciations or quarrels that take place in Parliament, which also goes viral, rather than progressive discussions which take place in the House.

Scarred by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s seven-month chemical fertiliser ban, effective from April to November 2021, tea production last month recorded 18.27 million kilos, it said. A figure lower than this last took place in August 1994, where tea production registered a figure of 16.20 million kgs, Forbes further said. Sri Lanka had its Parliamentary Poll on 16 August 1994, where the SLFP-led PA coalition won the poll, ending the UNP’s 17-year rule. Meanwhile, last month’s tea production of 18.27 million kgs is a year on year (yoY) decline of 30.65 per cent (5.60 million kgs), where, a year ago in August 2021, tea production recorded a higher figure of 23.87 million kgs. Consequently tea production in the first eight months of the year declined to a 26-year low, registering a figure of 171.37 million kgs.  A lower figure than this for the period January to August was registered in the period January to August 1996, where a figure of 169.7 million kgs were recorded,  said Forbes. In the year 1996 Sri Lanka experienced a drought hitting tea production, made worse by the LTTE bomb attack on the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which took place on 31 January 1996, further disrupting the economy. Meanwhile, tea production of 171.37 million kgs in the first eight months of the year, is a YoY decline of  19.15 per cent (40.60 million kgs), where, in the first eight months of last year (2021) tea production registered a figure of 211.97 million kgs, said Forbes. Consequently, tea export earnings in the first eight months of the year declined by 6.31 per cent (US$ 56.21 million) to $ 834.79 million (fob) year on year (YoY) and export volumes were down by 9.65 per cent (16.51 million kilos) to 171.06 million kgs in the same period, Forbes said.

They stated that though officers from the Govijana Seva Department had assured them that the aforesaid sum, which has been set aside for the renovation of the River, will be utilised for the said purpose, the reconstruction has still not got underway. Hence, they alleged that the massive sum set apart for the reconstruction work of the River had been pilfered by officers with vested motives. They further added that pilferage of public funds of this nature by officers should be probed by the Government forthwith and noted that those guilty of any offence should be prosecuted in keeping with the laws of the country.  BY Anurada Vishwanath – Polonnaruwa"

Addressing the media at the Department of Government Information yesterday (22), he said, “All samples of maize were tested, prior to production and after production of the ‘Thriposha’, for the harmful substance.” He lamented that he did not understand why such a derogatory report had been given to the media. All data is collected before distributing the stocks to the Regional Directors of Health, from where it was redistributed to the MOHs under them. “The PHIs based in those MOHs can monitor the stocks that arrive and should there be any issue regarding the quality, they can inform the Company and dispose of it. He said that some 245 of 451 stocks given to the Colombo Municipal Council, 99 of 250 given to Puttalam and 202 of 239 given to Gampaha MOH areas had been withdrawn when they were about to exceed their shelf life. Responding to questions regarding the laboratory reports, which had tested positive for a high level of aflatoxin in Thriposha, he noted that the samples had been obtained before August when there had been an issue regarding the billion parts per particle of the carcinogenic substance in the supplementary food. That too only one of seven samples that had been obtained had aflatoxin in it, he claimed. Kularathna noted that from 26 August 2022 to 11 September 2022 the Thriposha factory had received 33 containers of maize of which only 21 had been accepted while the remaining had been rejected due to aflatoxin levels. Explaining, he said that production of the supplementary food given to infants, children below five years and pregnant and breast feeding mothers had dropped by November 2021 with the inability to obtain raw materials – maize in particular. “We have not received maize stocks which have 01 part per billion and five parts per billion levels of aflatoxin in them since end last year. Thriposha that is prepared at present is for its adult consumers namely pregnant and breast feeding mothers. The Chairman of SLTL said that with the banning of maize importation in 2021 local maize cultivators had been called on to produce enough stocks to provide the grain for human and animal consumption. However, the former President later granted permission for the importation 10,000 MT of maize. The company was in a predicament that year with the pandemic and the issues that cropped up at the container terminal in the port. He said that the supplier had terminated the provision of maize when the imported stock was found to be contaminated with a high level of aflatoxin.       By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

But the test reports show that the level of aflatoxin in the stocks of Thriposha was way more than the permitted amounts, he lamented. “Legal action was taken against private sector institutions engaged in producing supplementary food items. But it is unfortunate that nothing is being done regarding a government institution engaged in the preparation of a supplementary food given to infants, pregnant and breast-feeding mothers.” The PHIUSL President urged the Government to take strict measures against those responsible, regardless of position, for failing to discharge their duties, after an in-depth probe. He alleged that the manufacturer of the supplementary food had no mechanism in place to test the raw materials being used. Nor does the company have a method to test the finished product before issuing it. The Government manufacturer temporarily suspended production a few months earlier when the imported maize was tested by Customs. Aflatoxin was detected in the imported stocks of maize at the time.

The situation has worsened due to the lack of sufficient spare parts to repair sleepers. He added that this was the main reason for train delays, which cannot be avoided at the moment. Speaking to the media, Seneviratne, highlighted that they would receive railway sleepers in April 2023, adding that given the current economic situation, the process of soliciting bids was also in a precarious position. “However, we are looking for a loan in this regard. In the future, there might be more collisions along the coast. However, we are working to come up with short-term solutions to minimise these mishaps,” he added. When asked what the speed restriction was between Fort and Wadduwa, Seneviratne said the speed was now 20 kmph. “However, the timetable was created assuming that trains would run at 40 to 50 kmph. This means that the delay in train journeys cannot be avoided if we are unable to operate at that speed limit,” he said. In response to train union claims, he said there were instances where certain top officials made contradictory decisions regarding issues at the department. when asked what the speed restriction was between Fort and Wadduwa. Seneviratne said, a major cause of the spare parts shortage was the cancellation of tenders this year to purchase 7,000 railway sleepers due to increase in prices. BY Thameenah Razeek"

Conversions are based on the benchmark, albeit administered ‘spot’ value of Rs 362.90 to the US dollar as at Friday (16 September). GoSL’s at least theoretical MP borrowing costs (BCs) declined by 1.13 per cent (1,806.69 million) to Rs 157,720.63 million, despite the increase in its FVMP debt yesterday due to market preference to invest in risk-free and high returns Treasury (T) Bills and T Bonds for the second consecutive market day. Market was short for a record 255 market days to yesterday though this shortfall decreased for the second consecutive market day, with yesterday’s fall being by 0.55 per cent (Rs 3,033 million) to Rs 548,070 million, nonetheless causing sustained rate pressure. Meanwhile, GoSL’s highest to the 258th highest FVMP debt has been recorded in the 258 consecutive market days to yesterday. GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs 3 trillion for a record consecutive 53 market days to yesterday due to a sustained lack of revenue. Transactions between Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and GoSL are foreign reserves-neutral and CBSL which administers daily open market operations, lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL. GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot.’ The ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and lower the cost of ‘essential’ imports, while ‘essential’ imports are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee, as Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy.

President Wickremesinghe, who visited the United Kingdom to attend the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, met the Sri Lankan Diaspora on Monday (19) afternoon. Many Sri Lankan businessmen, investors, and professionals living in the United Kingdom attended the meeting organised by the Sri Lankan High Commission. The President explained the future plans of the new government of Sri Lanka and invited Sri Lankans living there to join the new investment opportunities created in the country. He said the question of land in the North is the question which started off as missing persons and the reparation due to them. “This must be got out of the way. Look at some of the basic issues of devolution. What is heartening is that seven Chief Ministers outside the North and East and the Opposition Leader gave a set of proposals in 2018 when we were revising the Constitution. Members, Chief Ministers from the North and East agreed with it, so we can go ahead with it,” he said.  Speaking further, the President said 500,000 people of Sri Lankan origin identifying themselves as first or second generation live in the United Kingdom. “We want everyone to get involved. People of every ethnicity in the North. Not only in the North, they can also invest in the South. Some of you may have relations in the South or the East who you may want to help. No problem.

The minister revealed that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) had paid electricity bills of 148 religious places so far. “However, the Public Utilities Commission has advised the CEB not to do that anymore and the CEB will adhere to that guideline. If the Finance Ministry decided to provide a concession for religious places, we do not have any problem with that,” he added.

General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Station Masters’ Union (SLSMU) Kasun Chamara said train compartments and engines, abandoned over the years are now in operation, but they are not up to standard. He added that in comparison to these compartments that were imported without standards, the compartments imported in 1980 were suitable for running, but they have now been taken out of service and are not maintained. “There is also a shortage of train lubricants, as well as a severe shortage of various spare parts for engines and carriages, and there is a question of whether the relevant railway administration officials will intervene promptly. The Railway Department should have 19,382 employees, but there are presently around 10,500,” he said. Speaking further, he said vacancies at the department caused a significant impact on some sub-departments, and there is a major concern about whether the services in some sub-departments are properly provided. He said, “It is a sad situation that despite the fact that we have continuously informed the relevant authorities that there are nearly 3,000 vacancies in the transport sub-department, which deals directly with railway passengers, no responsible officials have intervened.” “The General Manager of Railways is successfully intervening for this purpose, but due to the failure of some sub-department heads and officers to fulfil the responsibilities assigned to them, we emphasise with responsibility that it is not possible to provide good service as expected by the General Manager of Railways. If the present crisis continues, and the parts needed for proper railway maintenance are not received promptly, more trains will be derailed due to railway defects in the future,” he added. Further, he said due to a lack of spare parts, passengers will soon face the possibility of many train journeys being cancelled due to a lack of operational train sets in the future.

Nanayakkara on the occasion noted that the programme has been much appreciated and inquiries in this regard by workers are increasing on a daily basis. “Any Sri Lankan who lives, works or holds dual citizenship in a foreign country are eligible to import an electric vehicle under the scheme. Those sending USD 20,000 or more between 1 May 2022 and 31 December 2022 can obtain a permit to import an electric car. Those who remit USD 3,000 or more via official channels from 1 May 2022 to May 2023 are eligible to import an electric motorcycle,” he added. Nanayakkara emphasised that it is mandatory for remittances to be sent via legal channels such as the banking system to be eligible for this benefit. He further said that 50 per cent of the money sent must be converted into rupees and added that a motorcycle or car can be imported for a value not exceeding 50 per cent of the amount remitted. Nanayakkara further said, “Importing vehicles to Sri Lanka is currently prohibited. But only Sri Lankan workers who send foreign remittance to the country have the facility to import EVs. Similarly, the tax levied on the import of luxury vehicles will also be revised in the future. But the permission is only to import EVs. These vehicles must be unused and either brand new or with zero millage. Similarly, it is mandatory to import the vehicle within one year.” The battery pack and electric motor of this imported vehicle should have a warranty of at least three years. This should be ensured by the manufacturer, importer and exporter, Nanayakkara added. “It should also be ensured that the battery is disposed in accordance with international electric vehicle road safety standards and approved standard procedures. The remittances sent to Sri Lanka can be converted into rupees and the taxes for this can be paid. They must also be subject to Department of Motor Vehicles compliance. A car should have at least 200 km mileage after charging once. Similarly, a report of all money remitted to Sri Lanka should be submitted through the relevant bank,” he added. Nanayakkara further said that the relevant application and information can be downloaded from the website of the Ministry of Labour or the Foreign Employment Bureau.  “The vehicle imported in this way cannot be transferred to a third party until two years after registration,” he added.  (NV)"

The post-mortem inquest into the death of the victim, Ishalini, was convened before the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court yesterday (20) and the latter’s sibling Vigneswaran Thiru Prasad, made the aforesaid remark while testifying. Continuing to testify, the witness stated, “My sister was employed at the Bauddhaloka Mawatha residence of MP Rishad Bathiudeen. During this period, she had rung my mother and told her that she has had put up with many hindrances, while serving there. On 3 July last year, my mother received a phone call from the Borella Police. They had informed her that my sister had been hospitalised. Then I dashed off to the hospital to see her but I was not allowed to do so.  On the 15th of that month, my sister died. My sister died due to burns she had suffered after being set alight. When my sister had informed my mother, that she was facing troubles at the house, my mother had told her that she will take her home on 6 July last year. It was during that time period, that my sister had suffered burnt injuries on 3 July. I think my sister had suffered her plight, due to the extreme fear of those in that household, that she would reveal the ordeal she has had to put up with in the house, in the event of her returning home. I have also given a statement to the Police in this connection.” Afterwards, the mother of the deceased, Raja Manikkam Ranjani, testified before Magistrate Jayasuriya and stated, “During the time that my late daughter had served at the house, she had conveyed to me that it was becoming quite impossible for her to be employed there. When she spoke last to me, I advised her to stay there and that I will arrive to pick her up. It must be mentioned here that since my late daughter went to work in that house, she had never returned home even for a holiday.  Even we had not gone there to look into her wellbeing. It was only after this incident, that we came to know, that she had been hospitalised having suffered burnt injuries. Accordingly, we went to see her at the hospital. When we went there, we saw her being fixed to a machine, but she succumbed to her injuries on 15 July 2021. I did not attend the post-mortem. I can recall that my daughter left our home in a healthy state. Hence, I still cannot comprehend how she had to face up to her terrible predicament at that house. They say that she had been set alight or burnt alive. But, I do not know, how that could have happened. During her time at our home, my daughter never had an affair with anyone.” Afterwards, testimony was also given to Court, by an uncle of the deceased, while further hearing of testimony into the death of the victim, was put off to 4 October.

Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara handed over the vehicle import permit to the first recipient’s nominee. Nanayakkara on the occasion noted that the programme has been much appreciated and inquiries in this regard by workers are increasing on a daily basis. “Any Sri Lankan who lives, works or holds dual citizenship in a foreign country are eligible to import an electric vehicle under the scheme. Those sending USD 20,000 or more between 1 May 2022 and 31 December 2022 can obtain a permit to import an electric car. Those who remit USD 3,000 or more via official channels from 1 May 2022 to May 2023 are eligible to import an electric motorcycle,” he added. Nanayakkara emphasised that it is mandatory for remittances to be sent via legal channels such as the banking system to be eligible for this benefit. He further said that 50 per cent of the money sent must be converted into rupees and added that a motorcycle or car can be imported for a value not exceeding 50 per cent of the amount remitted. Nanayakkara further said, “Importing vehicles to Sri Lanka is currently prohibited. But only Sri Lankan workers who send foreign remittance to the country have the facility to import EVs. Similarly, the tax levied on the import of luxury vehicles will also be revised in the future. But the permission is only to import EVs. These vehicles must be unused and either brand new or with zero millage. Similarly, it is mandatory to import the vehicle within one year.” The battery pack and electric motor of this imported vehicle should have a warranty of at least three years. This should be ensured by the manufacturer, importer and exporter, Nanayakkara added. “It should also be ensured that the battery is disposed in accordance with international electric vehicle road safety standards and approved standard procedures. The remittances sent to Sri Lanka can be converted into rupees and the taxes for this can be paid. They must also be subject to Department of Motor Vehicles compliance. A car should have at least 200 km mileage after charging once. Similarly, a report of all money remitted to Sri Lanka should be submitted through the relevant bank,” he added. Nanayakkara further said that the relevant application and information can be downloaded from the website of the Ministry of Labour or the Foreign Employment Bureau.  “The vehicle imported in this way cannot be transferred to a third party until two years after registration,” he added.  (NV)"

The post-mortem inquest into the death of the victim, Ishalini, was convened before the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court yesterday (20) and the latter’s sibling Vigneswaran Thiru Prasad, made the aforesaid remark while testifying. Continuing to testify, the witness stated, “My sister was employed at the Bauddhaloka Mawatha residence of MP Rishad Bathiudeen. During this period, she had rung my mother and told her that she has had put up with many hindrances, while serving there. On 3 July last year, my mother received a phone call from the Borella Police. They had informed her that my sister had been hospitalised. Then I dashed off to the hospital to see her but I was not allowed to do so.  On the 15th of that month, my sister died. My sister died due to burns she had suffered after being set alight. When my sister had informed my mother, that she was facing troubles at the house, my mother had told her that she will take her home on 6 July last year. It was during that time period, that my sister had suffered burnt injuries on 3 July. I think my sister had suffered her plight, due to the extreme fear of those in that household, that she would reveal the ordeal she has had to put up with in the house, in the event of her returning home. I have also given a statement to the Police in this connection.” Afterwards, the mother of the deceased, Raja Manikkam Ranjani, testified before Magistrate Jayasuriya and stated, “During the time that my late daughter had served at the house, she had conveyed to me that it was becoming quite impossible for her to be employed there. When she spoke last to me, I advised her to stay there and that I will arrive to pick her up. It must be mentioned here that since my late daughter went to work in that house, she had never returned home even for a holiday.  Even we had not gone there to look into her wellbeing. It was only after this incident, that we came to know, that she had been hospitalised having suffered burnt injuries. Accordingly, we went to see her at the hospital. When we went there, we saw her being fixed to a machine, but she succumbed to her injuries on 15 July 2021. I did not attend the post-mortem. I can recall that my daughter left our home in a healthy state. Hence, I still cannot comprehend how she had to face up to her terrible predicament at that house. They say that she had been set alight or burnt alive. But, I do not know, how that could have happened. During her time at our home, my daughter never had an affair with anyone.” Afterwards, testimony was also given to Court, by an uncle of the deceased, while further hearing of testimony into the death of the victim, was put off to 4 October.

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

Conversions are based on the benchmark, albeit administered “spot” value of Rs 362.45 to the US dollar as at Thursday (15). The fall in Government of Sri Lanka’s (GoSL) at least theoretical money printing borrowing costs (MPBCs) vis-à-vis  the decline in its face value (FV) MP debt accelerated due to market preference to invest in risk free and high returns Treasury (T) Bills and T Bonds at yesterday’s trading. Consequently GoSL’s MPBCs declined by 3.68 per cent (Rs 6,101.74 million) to Rs 159,527.32 million, whereas its FVMP debt fell by a mere 0.07 per cent (Rs 2,311million) to Rs 3,261,065.82 million (Rs 3.2611 trillion), thereby marginally defraying demand-pull inflationary pressure as well at yesterday’s trading. The market was short for a record 254 market days to yesterday, though this shortfall decreased by 0.98 per cent (Rs 5,479 million) to Rs 551,103 million, nonetheless causing  sustained rate pressure. Meanwhile, GoSL’s highest to the 257th highest FVMP debt has been recorded in the 257 consecutive market days to yesterday. GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs three trillion for a record consecutive 52 market days to yesterday due to a sustained lack of revenue.  Transactions between CBSL and GoSL are foreign reserves neutral and CBSL which administers daily open market operations; lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL.  GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. “Spot” trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in “spot.” The “spot” is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and lower the cost of “essential” imports, while “essential” imports are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee as Sri Lanka is an import dependent economy.   BY Paneetha Ameresekere"

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Success can only be easily attained when trade union operations are carried out in coordination and with a single goal,” he said. MP Thondaman met with the estate workers on 18 September to learn about their position and talk about the upcoming actions that would be made in conjunction during a trade union action at Ambals Hall in Maskeliya. He continued by claiming that the Maskeliya Plantation Company doesn’t care about the welfare of estate workers who have been taking part in trade union action for their fundamental rights. “We will also stand by it. Anyone can ask if such a trade union action is needed. The case in connection with Rs 1,000 daily wage for estate workers was pending in Court and we refrained from trade union activities as a result. Judgment in this connection has been granted now. Our requests are fair and reasonable and therefore have been engaging in trade union action. In case we went to the Wage Board the judgment would be in our favour,” according to Thondaman.    There must be unity between estate workers and trade unions. It is our strength. It is not practiced perfectly today so that is our weakness, Thondaman added. BY Naalir Jamaldeen"

Vice President of the ACMOA, Dr. Nishantha Samaraweera yesterday (19) said hospitals with large patient turnout felt the impact of the shortage of drugs more acutely. Hospitals are forced into strict management of the drugs they have to the extent that they have to curtail the number of patients being treated for certain serious illnesses like renal disease. There is a shortage of medicinal drugs and medical supplies, he said. Some of the drugs like Heparin an anticoagulant drug used during haemodialysis treatment and Mannitol used in treating accident patients with brain injury were in short supply.  In addition, there was only 10 to 20 per cent antibiotics available in hospitals. So, doctors are in a dilemma when prescribing drugs to patients. “If the antibiotic course was for 14 days, hospitals only have the particular antibiotic for nine or ten days,” he said. In addition there were shortages in nasogastric tube (NG tube-  carries food and medicine to the stomach through the nose), and several consumable items used during surgical intervention, reagents for full blood count testing so much so that the number of tests required have to be limited, he said. The situation is such that surgeons and theatre staff lack even hand sanitiser for scrubbing before surgery. They have to depend on soap and water. The ACMOA Vice President said that the cost of medicines and medical supplies was such that it was difficult to ask them to purchase the required item from the private sector. He noted that his outfit had asked the Health Minister on several occasions for a meeting to discuss the issue. Hospitals are doing all things possible to manage the available drugs- but the Ministry cannot expect hospitals to manage the situation and be happy about the outcome, he said. Meanwhile, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella during a meeting with  Pakistani High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Shahzad Chaudhary said  that all the groups in the health sector were “managing the drug situation in the country.” He said that by the coming month it would be possible to solve some of those drug related problems.

Following the conclusion of the meeting, MP Udaya Gammanpila told the Media that special consideration had been given to women representatives.

One of them has to be a female member. The Independent MPs’ coalition has decided to hold a series of seminars across the country in response to people’s issues. We would also find out solutions to the burning problems of the public whether the Government does it,” he said. Meanwhile, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara pointed out that this would aid in determining solutions for the people and what should be done in the future to avoid negative consequences. According to MP Wimal Weerawansa, they discussed and decided on the dates for the seminars to be held in district and divisional levels. The meeting lasted nearly three hours in the Communist Party office, and the party’s future course of action was thoroughly discussed. Suggestions have been made on how to act, particularly in the upcoming elections and what steps should be taken to increase women’s representation in politics. BY Thameenah Razeek"

However, tea export prices gained for the fourth consecutive month to last month (August 2022), aided by high oil prices,accelerating by 2.74 per cent (USD 0.13) to average at USD 4.88 per kg (“free on board” (fob)) in the reviewed eight-month period, compared to a flat YoY growth experienced in the first seven months of the year.Tea prices move in relation to oil prices. When oil prices rise, tea prices increase, but when oil prices fall, tea prices also decline. Consequently, the “fob” price of a kg of tea accelerated by 14.47 per cent (USD 0.82) to USD 5.45 per kg (fob), YoY last month, compared to a slower rate of growth, 14.47 per cent to USD 5.22 per kg (fob), YoY, witnessed in the previous month July 2022. However, tea export volumes fell for the fourth consecutive month to last month, scarred by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s six-month chemical fertiliser export ban from April 2021 to November 2021, declining by 10.76 per cent (2.48 million kg) YoY to 23.01 million kg last month. Nonetheless, tea export earnings gained for the third consecutive month last month despite a drop in export volumes, accelerating by 6.28 per cent (USD 7.41 million) to USD 125 million, YoY, compared to a slower growth rate of 1.99 per cent (USD 2.32 million) to USD 118.79 million,YoY, witnessed in July 2022.

According to Forbes, Iraq remained the No. 1 major importer of Sri Lanka tea with an increase of 31 per cent in imports YoY for January-August 2022. Russia secured second position with a total of 14.98 million kg, which, however isa 19 per cent decrease against total imports recorded for January-August 2021.

He said for some cancer patients, radiotherapy was the only treatment for their recovery and due to the lack of equipment, most patients were on the waiting list for over three months. He also pointed out that although the rate of recovery of these patients in foreign countries was 45 per cent, in Sri Lanka it is a mere 10 per cent. “There is a lack of radiotherapy in our country. Because of this, patients have to wait three months for radiotherapy treatment. Some serious cancer patients cannot even get treatment for two days. The shortage of machines should also be addressed fast”, he said. He also lamented that there was another type of machine that could be used to treat cancer patients but there were only two of these types of machines in the country. He said the shortage is not only in ‘Apeksha Hospital’ but also in other Districts as well. “Due to the lack of regular radiotherapy, the number of cancer patients cured in Sri Lanka has decreased to 10 per cent. If radiotherapy is not available, other drugs could be used as an alternative. However, these drugs are expensive. Even with the use of these expensive drugs, it has not been found whether the results were as effective as radiotherapy treatment. Some cancer patients have to be treated continuously for a year or more. The shortage of medicines and equipment is very serious”, he added. BY Aloka Kasturiarachchi"

This was decided in their first executive meeting recently. Following the conclusion of the meeting, MP Udaya Gammanpila told the Media that special consideration had been given to women representatives. He said the Uththara Lanka Sabhagaya is unique in that it has not taken control of other parties, as other major parties have. “Each party can appoint five members to the executive council. One of them has to be a female member. The Independent MPs’ coalition has decided to hold a series of seminars across the country in response to people’s issues. We would also find out solutions to the burning problems of the public whether the Government does it,” he said. Meanwhile, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara pointed out that this would aid in determining solutions for the people and what should be done in the future to avoid negative consequences. According to MP Wimal Weerawansa, they discussed and decided on the dates for the seminars to be held in district and divisional levels. The meeting lasted nearly three hours in the Communist Party office, and the party’s future course of action was thoroughly discussed. Suggestions have been made on how to act, particularly in the upcoming elections and what steps should be taken to increase women’s representation in politics. BY Thameenah Razeek"

We recently staged a token protest at Mahatma Gandhi Park in Batticaloa to draw the attention of the Government,” he said. He said, there are 13 people in jail who were arrested after 2018 and the Government can state that legal action will be taken against them. “They have been detained for four years. It didn’t matter what kind of crime each prisoner committed. However, the cases against them have not yet reached the Courts. Detaining them for an extended period of time under the guise of PTA was a source of concern. They may have committed minor crimes that do not warrant imprisonment, or they may have committed a crime that resulted in a six-month sentence.” The TNA MP said, those who have been imprisoned for an extended period must be released immediately. “Persons involved in various crimes have been granted Presidential Pardons. A person charged with murder was pardoned by President Maithripala Sirisena, Duminda Silva, who was convicted by the Supreme Court, was pardoned by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

There is a suspicion whether Minister Ali Sabry is appearing before the UNHCR as a representative of the Government or Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Another allegation about economic crimes has been made against the Government.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/09/19/ceb-loses-rs-69m-in-generation-profits/,CEB loses Rs 69M in generation profits,Author not found,0,2022-09-18T20:30:00+00:00," Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB’s) bottom line was dented by at least 36.97 per cent (Rs 69.33 million) on Saturday (17 September) alone, thereby reducing its generation profits to Rs 187.55 million due to the malfunctioning 3X300 mW Norochcholai Coal Fired Power Plant (NCFPP) on Saturday, an analysis of CEB data from yesterday (Sunday, 18 September) showed. If NCFPP was fully functional, it has the capacity to meet 40 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity generation needs. But because of this particular malfunction, which has been the ‘bane’ of CEB at least since 27 June, NCFPP provided only 33.90 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity requirements on Saturday, with another 51.50 per cent met by renewable energy (RE) and the balance 14.60 per cent, met by the expensive ‘CEB diesel’ and independent power producers’ (IPP)/private sector diesel together, respectively. However, if NCFPP was fully functional, the expensive ‘diesel electricity’ requirement would have been only needed to provide 8.50 per cent of CEB’s total electricity requirement on Saturday and not 14.60 per cent as was the case. It’s this additional 6.10 per cent of electricity obtained on Saturday after burning the expensive diesel to generate electricity, that translates to a lost generation profit of Rs 187.55 million to the CEB on Saturday. Consequently, CEB’s generation profits in the 14 consecutive days to Saturday were reduced by Rs 524.9 million (10.89 per cent) to Rs 4,817.92 million on a cumulative basis due to the malfunctioning NCFPP in the reference period.    The 900 mW (3X300 mW) NCFPP was built during President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s era at a cost of USD 1.35 billion sans tender call by the Chinese in a mix of commercial and ‘concessional’ loans. But more often than not, it has been malfunctioning since at least its full commissioning on 16 September 2014. The first of its 300 mW machines was commissioned on 22 March 2011 and the last on 16 September 2014. The period 16 September 2014 to 17 September 2022 covers a total of 2,924 days. If the above 14 days are prorated to 2,924 days, then CEB’s accumulated electricity generation losses due to the malfunctioning NCFPP would have translated to Rs 109.63 billion, in the event it was malfunctioning daily, a loss much more severe than the previous Yahapalana regime’s Treasury Bond scandal. Computation of CEB’s costs and income is based on data provided by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL’s) 2021 Annual Report. It discounts the 75 per cent electricity tariff hike which was effected from 9 August 2022 (Ceylon Today’s 10 August 2022 Edition) which would have enhanced CEB’s electricity generation profits and correspondingly, its generation losses as well. Average CEB tariff rate last year according to the CBSL was Rs 16.37 a unit (kilowatt hour). Calculations also discount CEB’s transmission and distribution losses estimated at 8.72 per cent last year. According to the CBSL’s 2021 Annual Report, the cheapest source of electricity to the CEB last year was ‘CEB Hydroelectricity’ at a cost of Rs 1.67 (one kilowatt hour (kWh)) a unit followed by coal (Rs 10.68), ‘Other renewable energy (RE) such as wind and mini-hydro electricity at Rs 16.22 a unit and IPP’ diesel (Rs 30.35 a unit) and ‘CEB diesel’ (Rs 32.03), respectively. Computation of costs/losses discount NCFPP’s malfunction since the commissioning of its first 300 mW Machine on 22 March 2011, to the interim period that transpired before the commissioning of its last 300 mW machine that took place on 16 September 2014.

In the previous month June, this figure (OPL) was Rs 12,444. The definition of OPL is the minimum monthly earnings needed by an individual in the country to be considered as being ‘non-poor.’ The meaning of ‘non-poor’ is the amount needed by such an individual to buy the bare necessities of life for a month to keep ‘his nose above the water.’ The OPL at Rs 13,138 in July means that an individual needed to earn a minimum of Rs 13,138 that month (July) to buy the bare necessities of life and thus to be considered as being non-poor. Meanwhile, the OPL as at last year was recorded at a mere Rs 7,913 by CSD. Therefore, the OPL within a short space of seven months to July of this year (2022) has risen by 66.03 per cent (Rs 5,225) to Rs 13,138, driven by record high inflation. In related developments, according to the last official poverty survey conducted by the CSD in 2019, it was found that 3.04 million of Sri Lanka’s population was poor. This accounted for 14.3 per cent of Sri Lanka’s population that year. Meanwhile, the OPL in 2019 was a mere Rs 6,966. It has since, that is, in a space of two years and seven months, risen by 88.60 per cent (Rs 6,172) to Rs 13,138 by July 2022, driven by record high inflation, ostensibly, driving more people to poverty.

He noted that the research report has been reported without proper study and this can lead to public unrest by highlighting wrong and false information. He also said that if this does not apply to the rice tested from January 2022, there is no basis for such reporting."

Under the restraining order, India imposed a 20 per cent duty on exports of white and brown rice. The affected rice accounts for about 60 per cent of India’s total rice exports. India has also banned the export of broken rice, but parboiled rice and basmati rice are not included in the restriction order. India is the world’s largest rice exporter, accounting for 40 per cent of the global rice trade. India exports rice to more than 150 countries, and any reduction in its shipments would increase upward pressure on food prices, which are already rising because of drought, heat waves and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At present, many countries around the world are suffering from a worsening food crisis or inflation, and this move by India will bring further pressure on these countries, as per reports. India is an important broken rice supplier to some African countries. But according to an article published by China Agricultural Information Network, China is the largest buyer of Indian broken rice, importing 1.1 million tones of broken rice from India in 2021. India’s total rice exports in 2021 reached a record 21.5 million tones, more than the rice exports of the world’s top four exporters Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, and the United States combined. Broken rice is mainly used in China as animal feed and in the production of noodles and wine, the report stated. India’s export restrictions on rice could raise global rice prices, leading to more food inflation, while also adding to the chaos in the global food market caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. In stark contrast to the surge in wheat and corn prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, rice has been a food item that has helped weather a bigger food crisis thanks to ample stocks. But with India’s latest move, that may be about to change. The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said global demand for broken rice has risen due to the geopolitical scenario, which has impacted the price movement of commodities including that animal feed. Rice is the third major agricultural product that the Indian government has imposed export sales restrictions on this year. After India had its hottest months in more than a century in March and April, the government restricted exports of wheat and sugar in May. India’s major growing states, such as Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar, experienced insufficient rainfall in June and were hit by erratic rainfall in July and August, leading to the reduction of rice acreage from one year to the next, the Ministry of Agriculture said. The previous 26.7 million hectares decreased by 13 per cent to more than 23.1 million hectares. iscal year to March, India exported about 3.8 million tons of broken rice globally, accounting for about a fifth of its total non-basmati rice exports. From April to June, exports of the cheap commodity amounted to 1.4 million tons or about a third of non-basmati rice exports. The new duty is likely to discourage buyers from making purchases from India and prompt them to shift towards rivals Thailand and Vietnam, which have been struggling to increase shipments and raise prices. The ban on exports assumes significance as it appears that the overall sown area under paddy this Kharif season could be lower than that of last year. This can have an impact on both crop prospects as well as prices going forward, a spokesman said. Farmers in India have sown less paddy this Kharif season. Kharif crops are mostly sown during monsoon -June and July, and the produce is harvested during October and November. (ANI)"

He said some farmers’ associations have begun to blame the Government and the Ministry of Agriculture, claiming that substandard fertiliser was imported, even though there is no evidence to support this claim. He added that the ministry is ready to make all necessary arrangements to provide fuel to farmers as the first step in the upcoming harvesting season, as well as free urea. “375,000 farmers will receive free urea fertiliser. A farmer who cultivates paddy on less than an acre of land will receive a 50 kg bag of urea,” he said. He highlighted that urea is being imported at a high cost at this time, but the Government intends to provide fertiliser to farmers at the appropriate time to ensure a full harvest. Speaking to farmers, Amaraweera said each farmer will receive Rs 25,000 to purchase organic fertiliser. Meanwhile, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has agreed to provide farmers with urea and triple superphosphate fertiliser. The Ministry of Agriculture has said urea and triple superphosphate fertiliser worth USD 55 million will be provided for this purpose. It was also decided that all paddy farmers will receive free triple superphosphate fertiliser. Attempts are being made to provide triple superphosphate fertiliser during the peak season, but as there is an import issue, they will be made available during the next Yala season.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Perera lamented that if such a ban had not been imposed, there would be no food crisis in Sri Lanka. “Today, our country, which was once praised as a granary, is forced to depend on the international community for food, particularly rice. Farmers’ harvest has dropped drastically, and is now unbearable. Many farmers have lost their source of income and are struggling to survive.” “Ranil Wickremesinghe, after being sworn in as Prime Minister, urged that we must resume agricultural activities. Summoning the chiefs of every State sector entity, he urged them to cultivate on vacant land. Food crop cultivation is presently taking place in Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) limits. The harvest is distributed among low-income families residing in apartments as well as Elders homes,” he said. “As President Wickremesinghe had taken a prudent decision, Sri Lanka is safe from a food crisis today. With a view to empower the rural economy, a joint rural development mechanism has been drafted and implemented.” The President has also formulated a national policy on food security and nutrition and how to prevent possible food deficiency, according to Perera. “President Wickremesinghe says no room must be left for child malnutrition. The Government is committed to look into the well-being of children as well as elders. The required amount of fertiliser has been given for the Maha Season. A bumper harvest can be expected in the Maha Season. We will be able to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production by 2025. Thereafter, there won’t be a food crisis in Sri Lanka. The President plans to produce over 50 per cent of total demand of ‘B’ onion and required amount of potato, soya, dried chili, lentils, cowpea, and peanut to meet the local demand,” Perera added.    By Naalir Jamaldeen"

He also said Government officials should be held responsible for the food crisis. “A food crisis has arisen in the country due to cultivation failure in the last Yala season and based on the same report, thus the provision of food to low-income families has become one of our leading programmes,” Dr. Batagoda said. A discussion to inform District Secretaries and Sivisional Secretaries was held at the President’s Media Division parallel to the implementation of the Multi-sector Combined Mechanism to empower Rural Economic Revitalisation Centre to ensure food security and nutrition introduced under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe on 13 September.  During this discussion held on-line headed by Presidential Adviser on National Food Security Dr.  Batagoda, implementation of the Multi-sector Combined Mechanism to ensure food security at rural level, issues that arise in the implementation of the mechanism and solutions were comprehensively discussed. He instructed divisional secretaries to gather required data to implement the programme, going from door-to- door within the next week. He also informed officials to gather data on-line. Dr Batagoda instructed them to implement the programme to ensure that all those who were deprived of food have access to food. During the discussion,  issues that arose in the establishment of Rural Economic Revitalisation Centres,  many issues faced by farmers such as lack of sufficient fertiliser for cultivation, shortage of seeds, lack of fuel to operate agricultural machinery, lack of pesticides, animal damage to crops and difficulties in marketing the surplus harvest were also discussed. Dr. Batagoda further pointed out that measures have already been taken to provide immediate solutions to these issues, and measures have been taken to import fertiliser and insecticides, and necessary arrangements have been made to provide a fuel quota under the QR code for fuel. He further assured that locally scarce seeds would be imported, and by way of combining all the Revitalisation Centers an opportunity will be provided to sell excess products at a reasonable price by making them available at Revitalisation Centers which experience deficit of such products. “The President’s instruction is to prevent starvation. Therefore, we have planned to provide food to the needy through a programme titled ‘Community Kitchen’.  Accordingly, it is hoped to strengthen household units and gather data to implement cultivation plans in the upcoming season. Food can be provided to people in the country without any shortage provided the programme is implemented continuously.  On the one hand, government officials should be held responsible for the food crisis. As government officials, we should also intervene to address the food crisis. We hope to implement food and cultivation programmes through this hub,” he said. Presidential Additional Secretaries L.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/09/19/ceb-loses-rs-69m-in-generation-profits/,CEB loses Rs 69M in generation profits,Author not found,0,2022-09-18T20:30:00+00:00," Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB’s) bottom line was dented by at least 36.97 per cent (Rs 69.33 million) on Saturday (17 September) alone, thereby reducing its generation profits to Rs 187.55 million due to the malfunctioning 3X300 mW Norochcholai Coal Fired Power Plant (NCFPP) on Saturday, an analysis of CEB data from yesterday (Sunday, 18 September) showed. If NCFPP was fully functional, it has the capacity to meet 40 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity generation needs. But because of this particular malfunction, which has been the ‘bane’ of CEB at least since 27 June, NCFPP provided only 33.90 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity requirements on Saturday, with another 51.50 per cent met by renewable energy (RE) and the balance 14.60 per cent, met by the expensive ‘CEB diesel’ and independent power producers’ (IPP)/private sector diesel together, respectively. However, if NCFPP was fully functional, the expensive ‘diesel electricity’ requirement would have been only needed to provide 8.50 per cent of CEB’s total electricity requirement on Saturday and not 14.60 per cent as was the case. It’s this additional 6.10 per cent of electricity obtained on Saturday after burning the expensive diesel to generate electricity, that translates to a lost generation profit of Rs 187.55 million to the CEB on Saturday. Consequently, CEB’s generation profits in the 14 consecutive days to Saturday were reduced by Rs 524.9 million (10.89 per cent) to Rs 4,817.92 million on a cumulative basis due to the malfunctioning NCFPP in the reference period.    The 900 mW (3X300 mW) NCFPP was built during President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s era at a cost of USD 1.35 billion sans tender call by the Chinese in a mix of commercial and ‘concessional’ loans. But more often than not, it has been malfunctioning since at least its full commissioning on 16 September 2014. The first of its 300 mW machines was commissioned on 22 March 2011 and the last on 16 September 2014. The period 16 September 2014 to 17 September 2022 covers a total of 2,924 days. If the above 14 days are prorated to 2,924 days, then CEB’s accumulated electricity generation losses due to the malfunctioning NCFPP would have translated to Rs 109.63 billion, in the event it was malfunctioning daily, a loss much more severe than the previous Yahapalana regime’s Treasury Bond scandal. Computation of CEB’s costs and income is based on data provided by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL’s) 2021 Annual Report. It discounts the 75 per cent electricity tariff hike which was effected from 9 August 2022 (Ceylon Today’s 10 August 2022 Edition) which would have enhanced CEB’s electricity generation profits and correspondingly, its generation losses as well. Average CEB tariff rate last year according to the CBSL was Rs 16.37 a unit (kilowatt hour). Calculations also discount CEB’s transmission and distribution losses estimated at 8.72 per cent last year. According to the CBSL’s 2021 Annual Report, the cheapest source of electricity to the CEB last year was ‘CEB Hydroelectricity’ at a cost of Rs 1.67 (one kilowatt hour (kWh)) a unit followed by coal (Rs 10.68), ‘Other renewable energy (RE) such as wind and mini-hydro electricity at Rs 16.22 a unit and IPP’ diesel (Rs 30.35 a unit) and ‘CEB diesel’ (Rs 32.03), respectively. Computation of costs/losses discount NCFPP’s malfunction since the commissioning of its first 300 mW Machine on 22 March 2011, to the interim period that transpired before the commissioning of its last 300 mW machine that took place on 16 September 2014.

In the previous month June, this figure (OPL) was Rs 12,444. The definition of OPL is the minimum monthly earnings needed by an individual in the country to be considered as being ‘non-poor.’ The meaning of ‘non-poor’ is the amount needed by such an individual to buy the bare necessities of life for a month to keep ‘his nose above the water.’ The OPL at Rs 13,138 in July means that an individual needed to earn a minimum of Rs 13,138 that month (July) to buy the bare necessities of life and thus to be considered as being non-poor. Meanwhile, the OPL as at last year was recorded at a mere Rs 7,913 by CSD. Therefore, the OPL within a short space of seven months to July of this year (2022) has risen by 66.03 per cent (Rs 5,225) to Rs 13,138, driven by record high inflation. In related developments, according to the last official poverty survey conducted by the CSD in 2019, it was found that 3.04 million of Sri Lanka’s population was poor. This accounted for 14.3 per cent of Sri Lanka’s population that year. Meanwhile, the OPL in 2019 was a mere Rs 6,966. It has since, that is, in a space of two years and seven months, risen by 88.60 per cent (Rs 6,172) to Rs 13,138 by July 2022, driven by record high inflation, ostensibly, driving more people to poverty.

He pointed out that there are around 17 ports operated by the Chinese in the Indian Ocean and they are all commercial ports, adding that, Hambantota is also a commercial port and not a military port. Speaking further he said the Indian Ocean region should be open to all to ensure freedom of navigation for commercial viability. He noted that Sri Lanka will not participate in military alliances and do not want the problems of the Pacific coming into the Indian Ocean. In this scenario, he urged regional nations to come together to look at how best to maintain stability. Addressing the first-ever graduation ceremony of the National Defence College in Colombo yesterday (15), President Wickremesinghe emphasised, “It is important for commerce to carry on. We have to remember that a bulk of the petroleum supply and energy supply to the world goes through the Indian Ocean. A large amount of shipping goes through the Indian Ocean. We don’t want this to be an area of conflict and an area of war.” He noted that Sri Lanka does not want to see a big power rivalry in the region which could get reflect everywhere while adding that the country is open to the navies of all countries with no discrimination. “If the navies want to come, we have no problem. They helped in the anti-piracy operations. But we don’t want a level of rivalry which will affect the security and the peace of our area. Whatever it be that we will not join any big power or take sides, we will stay out of it. And that’s why we want to ensure the big powers and their rivalries don’t need to certainly lead to conflict in the Indian Ocean. That’s one thing we can’t afford.” The President pointed out that if there is security significance, it is in the Port of Darwin in Australia where the Chinese ports are operating side by side where Australian and US forces are training. “We don’t have that. We don’t allow anyone to come and train here, but we do have our southern command of the Navy. We have a divisional headquarters of the Army and we have a detachment of the Air Force.  But none of them are involved. They only ensure that this is a commercial port and no less,” he said, adding that as it is a commercial port. “It shows Sri Lanka’s strategic importance that many people sort of come to conclusions which are unwarranted”. The President also expressed hope that the next agreement Sri Lanka has with China, will not cause such speculation and is only about debt reduction for Sri Lanka."

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

He said the Government is trying to persuade the people that privatising state institutions is the only way out of the economic crisis, which is completely absurd. Dissanayake recently told the media that the authorities are attempting to sell off state institutions because they are inefficient and incurring losses, while questioning why state institutions such as the Treasury and the Police, which are also inefficient, are not being privatised. He highlighted that the people of the country are naturally in favour of the Government’s “selling” of state institutions because it is extremely difficult for them to pay high tax rates. However, he said people are not to blame for inefficiency at state institutions. “In addition, the Sri Lanka Cement Corporation was sold. Prices of goods, however, were not reduced. As prices rise, people believe that if they stop buying cement, prices will fall,” he added. He said it is not a question of government or privately owned, but a socioeconomic crisis. He also said if the decision to sell is based on profits, they should sell the Central Bank as well. By Aloka Kasturiarachchi"

In their discussions with Sri Lankan officials, Azur Air stated that they would keep an eye on the fuel supply on 22 September, that would, according to the government, provide 100 per cent of refueling for aircraft at the Bandaranaike International Airport. Udayanga Weeratunge, who spearheaded bringing Russian visitors to Sri Lanka, during the pandemic, after striking an agreement with the Aeroflot, indicated that the Azur will begin its operations after observing the fuel status quo as it did not want to land in other countries for refueling, in the backdrop of war between Russia and Ukraine continuing. The Russian State-run Aeroflot, which stopped operating to Sri Lanka due to a dispute, has also indicated that it will resume flights once the Irish lessor’s law suit is over. Sri Lanka has granted permission for Aeroflot operations and there is no dispute in flying to Sri Lanka, but due to the controversial halting of their aircraft by Sri Lankan authorities three months ago, Aeroflot said they will not fly Russian tourists to Sri Lanka. In response to a contentious suspension of their airline three months ago, the State-run Russian airline Aeroflot withdrew from Sri Lanka. In an effort to draw Russian tourists to Sri Lanka for the winter, Sri Lankan officials, including the General Sales Agent of Maldiviana, approached Aeroflot, a rival of Azur Air. When Russia started a war with Ukraine, Celestial Aviation Trading Limited, an Irish business, that was Aeroflot’s lessor, halted the airline and demanded the return of the Airbus. Due to sanctions imposed by the European Union, all Irish lessors ended their leasing agreements with Russian airlines in order to reclaim their aircraft. The Irish firm’s lawyer filed an appeal at the Court of Appeal after the Irish company representative’s lawsuit was dismissed by the Colombo Supreme Court. Aeroflot currently offers two daily flights to the Maldives, and Sri Lanka is trying to get those flights to stop in Sri Lanka as well with Russian tourists who frequently travel in the winter. Weeratunga said Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardane verbally promised that there would be no stops or delays of any type for Aeroflot’s arrival the next time. Weeratunga claims that Aeroflot, which is currently involved in a legal dispute, will wait until after the final judgment is delivered to begin flying to Sri Lanka. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

That, we have been committed to and we will go ahead with it. There will be no movement out of it. That’s why we work with India on the Colombo conclave, on the trilateral security arrangements and many other fields, especially outside the military field of piracy, of human trafficking, of drugs.

Then, we also value our friendship with the Maldives, those small islands, and we know how important the Maldives is,” he said. He also said that now that the terrorism war is over, peace needs to be established in the country and he expects to reach a final settlement with the Tamils and the Northern population of the country within the next few months. In this regard, the President said that he is currently in discussion with the Tamil parliamentarians in order to achieve that goal.

He pointed out that the current President, in 2015, while he was Prime Minister, attempted to work on it but there were no constructive approach in place. He said those who were released were on bail based on the country’s law and no politicians released them or initiated their release as they claimed. “The government says they would repeal the PTA however now they are looking at a process under which the detainees could be released. This is a completely an eyewash and contrary to the statement Foreign Minister Sabry makes to the international community in Geneva about repealing the PTA.” He also pointed out that the families of the enforced disappeared are still wanting to know what had happened to their loved ones and have been protesting for over 2,000 days. “Many of those mothers and close relatives have died without hearing the truth.” He recalled that the President, several years back, confirmed that those who disappeared are dead and never took any initiative to hold inquiries or find a practical solution to get to the truth. “Those that surrendered to the Government, those who have been arrested, comprise over 16,000 persons according to Government findings and inquiries, but they did not investigate how it happened.” He alleged the reason for it was the fear that military personnel would be found guilty and would result in war crimes charges. “This has resulted in ignoring the issue whereas the relatives, and mothers and fathers are still looking for those who went missing. In this background, Wickremesinghe and Sabry are telling the international community that they would resolve the issue soon.” Premachandran also said the land grab in the North and East is still continuing where the Army and the Navy are taking over private lands owned by locals. “In Palai, Jaffna, the military has tried to take 1,400 acres of land to run a farm. These lands are Tamil people’s properties that have been occupied for generations”. He reiterated that even former President J.R. Jayewardene accepted that it’s the Tamil people’s traditional land and through the Indo-Lanka Accord the two Governments wanted to merge the North and East. He pointed out that in Kuchchaveli Divisional Secretariat, over 27 square km, which is nearly 7,000 acres of land, has been turned into a Sinhala village named Padavisiripura and the area merged with another Sinhala Divisional Secretariat that was linked to the Divisional Secretariat of Anuradhapura. This has led to the separation of land between Mullaitivu and Kuchchaveli. “Similarly, there are new settlements in the ancient Thirukoneshwarar temple area.” On the same line, he projected that the President said he would create an economic centre in the Northern Province where around 90,000 women-headed families are living. “There are differently-able young women and men living unable to move about.  There are no job opportunities for them. During the good governance, President Wickremesinghe planned to make an economic centre in Omanthai in Vavuniya and 22 acres of land was allocated. Today that building is dilapidated due to politicising the venture.” Similarly, Premachandra pointed out the Palaly Airport has been kept shut and travellers have to spend over Rs 150,000 to travel to Katunayake for flights. He alleged that the Government fears that Palaly airport would boom businesses and the Tamil Diaspora would use it often while other airports would lose business. “So, politicians telling the international community about promoting the North and East as a trade hub are hogwash.” He urged the President to find quick remedies resolve the burning issues rather than hoodwinking the international community.

While speaking to the Media at Sirikotha, Dr. Manchanayake stressed that the President is committed to food security and dealing with a possible food crisis expected to happen in the future. He said India had suspended food exports and the Government is unable to import lentils due to the recent floods in Pakistan. “As a result of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the price of wheat flour has skyrocketed, and there is a flour shortage in both the international and domestic markets. We had predicted that such a situation would arise in the country nearly two years ago. The previous administration paid little attention to this issue. We need to create a home role model for food security and nutrition, as well as what kind of measures can be taken in the future to deal with a food crisis,” Manchanayakke says. Further, he said President Wickremesinghe has formed a committee to handle this matter which will incorporate the latest technology. He highlighted that a food security programme has been implemented in the country, covering every Grama Niladhari Division, and that necessary arrangements have been made to cultivate crops suitable for specific regions. “With the introduction of the QR system into the food supply chain, farmers who have suffered losses due to a lack of a suitable market place will breathe a sigh of relief,” Dr. Manchanayake said. “If there is surplus in a particular area, the farmers can bring it to the attention of the Government through this system and the Government will take necessary action to transport it to areas experiencing a shortage of that particular food item. The Grama Niladhari divisions experiencing the shortage of a particular food item can be detected via this system. For the first time food security programme is to be introduced in Sri Lanka under the administration of President Wickremesinghe,” he concluded. BY Naalir Jamaldeen"

He also said almost all political parties that demand the abolition of Executive Presidency because it gives immense power to a single person, have no democracy within their own parties and are in the clutches of one person or a group. He claims that these parties frequently practise dictatorship and do not allow juniors to think beyond what the leader dictates. He noted that when these parties form committees, all power is concentrated in one person or one location. “The main issue arises once these contestants become leaders. This is a major issue that the Commission must address. During election season, we normally publicise ethics to be followed by parties in all three languages. They are abandoned on day one. The complainant and the parties work as they please, and as the Commission, we can only watch and do nothing,” he explained. Further, he said he wants to legalise ethics and make it legal to take legal action against people who do not follow ethics. He suggested that the contestants be given full duty time.

The other members of the Core-Group are the United States of America, Germany, Canada, Malawi, North Macedonia and Montenegro jointly expressed their concern over other human rights developments since April 2022 including violence against and arrests of peaceful protesters, as well as violence against Government supporters, resulting in deaths, injuries, destruction and damage to houses of Members of Parliament and stresses the importance of independent investigations into all attacks and for those found responsible to be held to account. The Group also called  on the Government of Sri Lanka to address the on-going economic crisis and help ensure it does not happen again, including by investigating and, where warranted, prosecuting corruption, including by public and former public officials, and stands ready to assist and support independent, impartial, and transparent efforts in this regard. They also noted that they remained concerned at the continued militarisation of civilian government functions; the erosion of the independence of the judiciary and key institutions responsible for the promotion and protection of human rights; lack of progress in addressinglong-standing grievances and demands of Tamil and Muslim populations; surveillance, intimidation and harassment of journalists, human rights defenders, families of the disappeared and persons involved in memorial initiatives and sexual and gender-based violence. The draft of the Core Group recognised  the importance of preserving and analysing evidence relating to violations and abuse of human rights and related crimes in Sri Lanka with a view to advancing accountability, and decided to extend and reinforce the capacity of the Office of the High Commissioner to collect, consolidate, analyse and preserve information and evidence and to develop possible strategies for future accountability processes for gross violations of human rights or serious violations of international humanitarian law in Sri Lanka, to advocate for victims and survivors, and to support relevant judicial and other proceedings, including in Member States, with competent jurisdiction. They have also added a new resolution of ‘recognising the recent efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka to address the on-going economic crisis, and welcoming the staff-level agreement reached between the Government of Sri Lanka and the International Monetary Fund’. Based on the HRC resolution 47/7, they also noted that they have recognised that the promotion and protection of human rights and the prevention of and fight against corruption were mutually reinforcing, that corruption can have a serious negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights, and that the poor and those in marginalised and vulnerable situations, including women and girls, are at particular risk of suffering from the adverse impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human rights. The Core-Group also said they have to reiterate the Sri Lankan Government’s commitment to constitutional reforms while stressing the importance of the independence of key commissions and institutions including the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, the Election Commission, the National Police Commission, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and the judiciary. The Core-Group also called on the Government of Sri Lanka to fulfil its commitments on the devolution of political authority, which is integral to reconciliation and the full enjoyment of human rights by all members of its population, and encouraging the Government to respect local governance, including through the holding of elections for provincial councils, and to ensure that all provincial councils, including the northern and eastern provincial councils, are able to operate effectively, in accordance with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka as mentioned in the 46/1 resolution passed in 2021. They also recalled the responsibility of States to comply with their relevant obligations under human rights law and international humanitarian law, including, where applicable, to prosecute those responsible for gross violations of human rights law or serious violations of international humanitarian law. They welcomed the engagement of the Government of Sri Lanka with the Office of the High Commissioner and the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, urges the continuation of such engagement and dialogue, and calls upon Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations made by the Office and to give due consideration to the recommendations made by the special procedures and that the resolution could be further amended.

Accordingly, 1 kg of chicken now sells for Rs 1,450. AIPA Chairman, Ajith Gunasekara yesterday (14) said, there were all possibilities for the price of meat to see a further increase with escalating prices of electricity, water, and the shortage of raw materials to produce poultry food. “We have already appealed to Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, the Department of Animal Production and Health, and the Ministry of Livestock Development. Appeals were made to provide the surplus imported rice as chicken feed,” he said, adding however that the ban of using imported and local rice as animal feed proved an obstacle in obtaining poultry food. Gunasekara explained that the closure of medium and small poultry farms which catered largely to the ‘wet market’ situated in Bastian Mawatha and Ja-Ela upped the price of chicken to Rs 1,450. Live fowls are purchased on a daily basis for meat. This particular section of the poultry industry caters to eateries. The closure of small and medium farms has dealt a severe blow to them, as they have to find farms to purchase animals. Therefore, the cost of transport, employee wages, and the existing shortage has led to the increase. The AIPA Chairman said, the frozen market depends on “market prices” – similar to the price of vegetables and fish. “The AIPA cannot take that decision,” he stressed.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

According to him, only 1,500 visitors would be allowed to visit the top of the tower today and that this capacity would increase to 2,000 during the weekends. “As of now, we cannot manage the crowd and cannot accommodate more than that.

They get a 60 per cent subsidy. Only 50 per cent of the actual cost is charged from those using above 61 units and below 90.  A 50 per cent subsidy is also given to that category. Accordingly, 75 per cent of electricity consumers are still being subsidised even with the new tariff revision.

Furthermore, the international community must continue to push for justice, transparency, and accountability for human rights violations committed during the civil war to help the people of Sri Lanka move forward.” While commending the Biden administration and other Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) members’ support for Sri Lanka, the resolution calls on the UN Human Rights Council to extend its war crimes accountability resolution; urges Sri Lankan security forces to respect Sri Lankans’ rights to protest peacefully; and presses President Ranil Wickremesinghe to work with opposition parties and ethnic minority groups in efforts to address the crisis.

Deputy Director General Medical Supplies Division (DDG MSD), Dr. D.R.K. Herath, fielding questions regarding the prevailing medicinal drug shortage, during a media briefing at the Health Ministry, said, “At the moment we are unable to give an update of the exact number of drug and medicinal supplies that are in short supply, but daily monitoring that is done due to the prevailing country situation shows a shortage in a number of essential drugs,” he observed. He, however, assured that vital drugs were available.  Deputy Director General (Disaster Management and Emergency Response) Dr. Hemantha Herath said, the country’s drug shortage was highly dynamic. “The Ministry receives the drugs that are in short supply on the following day,” he said noting that large stocks are being cleared on a regular basis as the Ministry did not wait till the last minute to place orders. But the prevailing situation in the entire world has also placed Sri Lanka at somewhat of a disadvantage, he said. Meanwhile, the DDG MSD said that the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) and local manufacturers were able to provide only 20 per cent of the country’s drug requirement while the remaining 80 per cent was borne by suppliers. Bangladesh has been able to manufacture and supply its own market as well as those of other countries. Sri Lanka currently manufactures approximately 200 pharmaceuticals. Currently there are investors willing to invest in production and pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka as well, he said. He noted however, that there was an increase in the patient population seeking services in the free health service at present. But the Ministry has taken all possible measures to manage the available drugs and ensure that all patients received treatment. Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella recently said that the medical supply department should update the necessary information properly and take the full responsibility of continuously providing the medicines without a shortage. A good relationship should be established between other related institutions, he added. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

While addressing the Council members of the United Nations Human Rights Council yesterday (13), China’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Chen Xu further noted, “China opposes any country taking advantage of current difficult situation in Sri Lanka to seek self-interest, and urges ‘relevant parties’ to respect the human rights development path that Sri Lanka has independently chosen according to its national conditions. China also urges relevant parties to abandon the practice of using human rights to exert political pressure and interfere in other’s internal affairs. Chen Xu further said that China firmly supports Sri Lanka to safeguard its sovereignty, independence, to maintain social stability and achieve economic recovery. “I expounded firm support to Sri Lanka to safeguard its sovereignty and independence, maintain social stability and achieve economic recovery. I urged relevant parties to respect Sri Lanka’s right to choose independently the path to development.” He added that China appreciates Sri Lanka’s continued efforts in enhancing and protecting its human rights, especially in reconciliation, reconstruction and counter-terrorism. As a traditional friendly neighbour of Sri Lanka, China firmly supports the country in safeguarding national sovereignty and independence, maintaining social stability and realising economic recovery. We believe the Sri Lankan Government is able to lead the people to overcome temporary difficulties. The Resolution on Sri Lanka, he said, “is a product of politicisation,  which doesn’t abide by the principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, has not been recognised by Sri Lanka, the country concerned, has not played a constructive role in promoting and protecting human rights in Sri Lanka.” Joining the debate, Türkiye requested the Council to extend the time frame for Sri Lanka to fulfil its obligations to the United Nations Human Rights Council during these difficult times, considering the current social and economic challenges. Also, the UN representative from Iran stated at the 51st session of the UN Human Rights Council should not politicise but should avoid political prejudices toward any country. “These mechanisms should not be utilised to further the political objectives of a specific group of nations against developing countries.” South Sudan stated that human rights must always be protected with the consent of the country concerned. Syria, on the other hand, praised Sri Lanka for confronting the problems of the social and economic crisis. “We restate our rejection of Western interventionist agendas that use human rights issues to implement political objectives and interfere in the internal affairs of the world’s countries,” the Syrian representative to the UN said.

Tourism Ministry Secretary Chulandanda Perera told, Ceylon Today that the ADB is funding the project, which is set to be completed in April 2023. The idea is to improve the tourism business and produce revenue for the people who live in the areas where the walking trail will be constructed. The idea is for the villagers to serve meals etc. available in their communities to those who use the walking track that runs through their villages. “The walking trail will also pass through various tea farms and estate managers are encouraged to make their estate workers to serve hot tea and snacks. These persons who will make a living by promoting tourism in this way will be trained before opening their modest stores along the walking trail,” explained Perera. The villagers would be trained on hygiene and running eateries. Every 13km walk will have stalls serving food and refreshments, and the walk would last roughly 22 days, beginning in Hantane and ending in Nuwara Eliya, according to Perera.

He claimed that as a first step in stopping these unqualified appointments, they asked CAA Chairman to appoint qualified persons to the right positions. If the Chairman does not follow it or initiate any inquiries, he warned, the NMCRP will file suit in Court. According to him, the CAA is the only organisation authorised by law to defend consumer rights in Sri Lanka. It was founded by the Consumer Affairs Authority Act No. 9 of 2003, and that Act makes it quite clear how officers should be hired by that authority. He continued pointing out that Section 3 (1) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act No. 9 of 2003 mentions the composition of the Authority. “The authority shall consist of a chairman and not less than ten other members appointed by the minister from among those who have recognised qualifications in the fields of industry, law, economics, commerce, administration, accounting, science, or health and have attained experience and excellence in those fields,” he said. He said they express their opposition to the Government regarding the appointment of a ‘group of friends’ as members of the CAA, aside from defending the rights of consumers, despite the fact that it is mentioned in the Act and the Minister has gone on to do so in violation of the relevant Act. “There are over 400 grads employed by the Department of Consumer Affairs. The Minister should be humiliated for choosing unqualified individuals to supervise these graduates and it is ironic that these members also look into complaints made by customers. We ask the Government to appoint suitably competent individuals to the CAA in place of those who are not qualified,” he added. BY Thameenah Razeek"

The Rights organisations said, in a letter to Council members, that the resolution should also call upon Sri Lanka to address ongoing abuses, including ending use of the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act. They also noted that on 8 September 2022, President Ranil Wickremesinghe appointed three people implicated in human rights abuses as Government ministers. Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, known as Pillaiyan, is a former member of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) unit, who later joined a pro-Government armed group, both of which committed abductions and recruitment of child soldiers. In 2001, the Attorney General dropped charges against him in connection with the 2005 murder of a parliamentarian. Another newly appointed minister, Lohan Ratwatte, resigned as Prisons Minister in September 2021 after threatening prisoners at gunpoint. A third, Sanath Nishantha, is currently under Police investigation in connection with a violent attack on anti-Government protesters on 9 May. Sri Lanka has been suffering a severe economic, political, and human rights crisis. The former President, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, resigned in July 2022 following massive protests, and his successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has used abusive security measures to suppress freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.  “For many years the victims of past abuses in Sri Lanka have demanded justice, while successive Governments have broken promises, blocked accountability, and promoted those implicated in war crimes to high office,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The UN Human Rights Council should adopt a resolution on Sri Lanka that presses the government to uphold accountability and the rule of law.” “These ministerial appointments show that the Wickremesinghe administration cannot be expected to credibly pursue accountability for human rights violations or uphold the rule of law,” said Ahmed Adam, UN advocacy programme manager at FORUM-ASIA. “The alarming situation in the country today calls for robust and clear-eyed resolution from the Human Rights Council to protect the rights of people in Sri Lanka.” At the 51st session of the Human Rights Council, which began on 12 September, member States will review and update a March 2021 resolution that established a UN accountability project to collect and prepare evidence of international crimes committed in Sri Lanka for use in future prosecutions, and mandated the UN to monitor and report on the current situation in the country. It is essential to renew and strengthen those mandates, including with additional resources, Amnesty International, said “Time and again we have seen successive Sri Lankan Governments make commitments to the Human Rights Council that are then broken or disavowed,” said Yamini Mishra, South Asia director at Amnesty International. “Member States should press Sri Lanka on its commitments and call for action now to end the abuses that are taking place, while renewing and enhancing the UN’s mandates to monitor the situation and pursue accountability for past abuses.” “The High Commissioner has presented clear findings that require urgent international action to end impunity and provide for justice to Sri Lankans,” said Massimo Frigo, UN representative and senior legal adviser at the International Commission of Jurists. “A decade of Human Rights Council engagement on Sri Lanka has been a source of hope for victims and resulted in sporadic and unfulfilled pledges to reform, the council needs to give the issue sustained attention.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Accordingly, Tamil Nadu-based NGO Pasumai Thaayagam, Australian Tamil Congress, British Tamils Forum, Maison du Tamil Eelam (France), Mauritius Tamil Congress, and United States Tamil Action Group have urged the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), joining many other Tamil Diaspora organisations, to bring a strong resolution on Sri Lanka at the ongoing session in Geneva. The strong demand for resolution comes in the wake of several locals representing the recent protesters in Sri Lanka speaking at side events, citing how the Government has suppressed freedom of speech and democratically held protests. The Government’s strong stance on rejecting resolution 46/1 passed on the country in 2020, which includes the rejection of the OHCHR office setting up an evidence-gathering mechanism on Sri Lanka’s alleged human rights violations. Pasumai Thaayagam demanded the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to initiate an independent investigative team to operate similar to the mechanisms set up for Myanmar (IIMM) and Syria (IIIM) and evidence from all credible, reputed sources should be accepted by the mechanism. As part of recovery from both the financial crisis and the war, the opportunity for fundamental change in Sri Lanka’s human rights trajectory must be seized, the Tamil Nadu-based NGO in its written statement to the OHCHR said. “As Sri Lanka debates changing the Constitution to get rid of the 20th Amendment or eliminating the executive presidency, it must also grapple with the root causes of the ethnic conflict, necessary for non-recurrence of conflict and human rights abuses. The structure of the state must be reformed to move away from the strongly unitary state in which all power resides with the central government. Chauvinist Sinhalese Buddhist politicians have used ethno-nationalism to attack and weaken the Tamils and Muslims, who continue to feel under threat.In our traditional areas of occupation in the North and East, Tamils and Muslims have no control over land, language, education, law and order, etc.” The statement further noted that the Office for Reparations is a bureaucratic exercise which has, if at all, benefited only the Government side of those affected by the war. The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) was effectively dismantled by the latest Rajapaksa government. Not a single disappeared person has been located, nor a single member of the Security Forces remains in prison for crimes committed during the war. Neither institution was formed with or includes victim participation. Notably, no accountability mechanism has been set up, even though resolution 30/1 called for a hybrid justice mechanism. Sri Lanka is in the midst of a severe financial and political crisis which has brought considerable attention to the island. The crisis has not yet caused the Government to completely collapse or brought the military directly into control, but there is a high likelihood of further instability. With instability and a very large security sector, there is the strong possibility of an increase in the human rights abuses for which Sri Lanka is known, namely killings, disappearances, torture and sexual violence.

He also said, “We will continue to provide the necessary support and resources to strengthen the functioning of the independent domestic mechanisms including the Office on Missing Persons (OMP), the Office for Reparations (OR), the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL).” Speaking on the proposed 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, he noted, the Amendment introduces several salient changes which would strengthen democratic governance and independent oversight of key institutions, and combat corruption including through the constitutional recognition of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC). “Sri Lanka remains committed to protecting human rights and reconciliation through independent domestic institutions,” he further noted. He said, Sri Lanka, along with several members of the Council, have opposed resolution 46/1, fundamentally disagreeing with its legitimacy and objectives. “We have consistently highlighted that the content of the resolution, its operative Paragraph 6 in particular, violates the sovereignty of the people of Sri Lanka and the principles of the UN Charter,” he added. “Once again, we are compelled to categorically reject any follow-up measures to the resolution, as well as the related recommendations and conclusions by the High Commissioner,” he added. Measures aimed at promoting reconciliation and human rights, if they are to be meaningful and sustainable, must be based on cooperation with the country concerned, be compatible with the aspirations of its people, and be consonant with its basic legal framework, Sabry said. “We endeavour to establish a credible truth-seeking mechanism within the framework of the Constitution. The contours of a model that would suit the particular conditions of Sri Lanka are under discussion,” he said. “It is 13 years since the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and since then, a new generation has emerged with their own aspirations. While issues of reconciliation and accountability are being comprehensively addressed through a domestic process, it is time to reflect realistically on the trajectory of this resolution which has continued on the agenda of the Council for over a decade, and undertake a realistic assessment on whether it has benefited the people of Sri Lanka,” he said. Sabry added, there is a need to acknowledge actual progress on the ground and support Sri Lanka adding that the current challenges, though formidable, have provided us with a unique opportunity to work towards institutional change for the betterment of our people. “We are not hesitant to acknowledge our challenges and forge ahead with renewed vigour. While our immediate concern is economic recovery, advancing the human rights of our people is of equal priority. We look to the genuine support and understanding of this Council, as we proceed on this path,” he said.  (FT)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/09/13/conduct-independent-transparent-probe-ohchr/,"Conduct independent, transparent probe – OHCHR",Author not found,0,2022-09-12T20:50:00+00:00," The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), yesterday (12) at the on-going 51st session of the Human Rights Council (UNHRC), called for an independent and transparent investigation, with international assistance if necessary, into the Easter Bombings of 2019, to pursue further lines of inquiry, in particular the role of the security establishment, in a process that guarantees the full participation of victims and their representatives. Acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif informed UN Council Members that, despite the arrest of several individuals, there has been no further progress in determining the truth about the horrific Easter Sunday attacks. She also reiterated that in the 13 years since the end of the war, where tens of thousands of survivors and their families continue to seek justice and to know the truth about the fate of their loved ones is remaining in need of reparations. “The Sri Lankan State has repeatedly failed to pursue an effective transitional justice process and uphold victims’ rights to truth, justice and reparations. Rather, as described in our previous reports, successive governments have created political obstacles to accountability, actively promoted and incorporated some military and former paramilitary officials credibly implicated in alleged war crimes into the highest levels of government, and have failed to present a shared understanding of the conflict and its root causes.” She also pointed out that the High Commissioner at the 49th session in 2020 said the scale and type of the accountability work require adequate time, financial resources and support by States and therefore urged the Council to ensure that this important work is appropriately reinforced. She said, the OHCHR received continued reports of surveillance and intimidation of civil society organisations, victim groups, human rights defenders, journalists and former cadres of the LTTE by Police, military and intelligence services. “Without fundamental security-sector reforms and de-militarisation of the North and the East, this pervasive culture of surveillance and oppression will not end,” she added. Referring to Human Rights Council Resolution 46/1, Paragraph 6, she reiterated about the team established by the Office to advance accountability has made important progress. “The team has conducted proactive investigative and analytical work, including in relation to gender and child-related violations, and is consolidating information and evidence collected by the United Nations and other bodies and entities into a repository, which will assist future accountability initiatives, she pointed out. She added that the OHCHR will continue to place victims at the heart of this work.  This includes seeking to minimise security risks faced by those who speak out about past violations. The broad-based demands by Sri Lankans from all communities, in particular youth, for accountability and democratic reforms present an important starting point for a new and common vision for the future of Sri Lanka. I encourage the new Government to embark on a national dialogue to advance human rights and reconciliation and to carry out the deeper institutional, democratic and security sector reforms needed to restore the independence of key institutions, combat impunity, to prevent the recurrence of human rights violations, and to tackle the economic crisis. In doing so, it is essential the Government ensures an environment that respects and promotes free expression, peaceful assembly and inclusive democratic participation. Of concern in recent weeks, scores of leaders and members of the protest movement and trade unions have been arrested. Particularly troubling was the use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to arrest three student leaders on 18 August 2022, despite the Government’s announcement in June 2022 that it has been applying a de facto moratorium on the use of this Act since March of this year”. She stressed that the Government has a fresh opportunity to steer the country on the path toward justice and reconciliation and to address the legacy of conflict.    The continuation of land disputes, mainly related to Buddhist heritage conservation at Hindu or Muslim sites or expansion of military installations in the Northern and Eastern Provinces has further jeopardised reconciliation and created new tensions, she added.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/09/13/sls-food-crisis-likely-to-worsen-fao-wfp-report/,"SL’s food crisis likely to worsen – FAO, WFP report",Author not found,0,2022-09-12T20:50:00+00:00,"The unravelling food crisis in Sri Lanka is likely to worsen if authorities fail to establish life-saving assistance and livelihood support, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) warned in a new report. The report says an estimated 6.3 million people in Sri Lanka are facing moderate to severe acute food insecurity and their situation is expected to worsen if adequate life-saving assistance and livelihood support is not provided. Two consecutive seasons of poor harvests led to a nearly 50 per cent drop in production coupled with reduced imports of food grains due to foreign exchange constraints. The total cereal import requirement in 2022 is estimated at 2.2 million MT. In the first six months of 2022, more than 930,000 MT of cereals were imported, leaving an outstanding import requirement of 1.27 million MT. Given the persisting macroeconomic challenges, there is a high risk that the remaining import requirement will not be met, the statement warned. “Months into this crippling economic crisis, families are running out of options – they are exhausted. More than 60 per cent of families are eating less, and eating cheaper, less nutritious food. This comes at a time when financial constraints have forced the Government to scale back on nutrition programmes, such as school meals and fortified food to mothers and undernourished children. WFP’s top priority is to provide immediate food and nutrition assistance to the most at-risk communities to prevent a further deterioration of their nutrition,” said WFP Representative and Country Director in Sri Lanka Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, in a statement. The report notes that immediate food assistance and livelihood programmes – including through existing social assistance mechanisms – are critical to enable households to access nutritious food – particularly moderately and severely acute food insecure ones.  Without assistance, the food security situation is expected to deteriorate further, particularly during the October 2022 to February 2023 lean season, driven by poor harvests of staple foods, in particular paddy rice and the on-going economic crisis, the statement said.  “In order to avert a further deterioration of food security conditions and to support restoration of agricultural production, livelihood assistance targeting smallholder farmers should remain a priority,” said FAO Representative in Sri Lanka Vimlendra Sharan. “With around 30 per cent of the population depending on agriculture, improving the production capacity of farmers will ultimately boost the resilience of the agricultural sector, reduce import requirements amid shortages of foreign currency reserves and avert the rise in hunger.” At the request of the Government, the joint Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission visited all 25 districts in the country between June and July 2022 to analyse agricultural production levels in 2022, particularly of main staple cereals, as well as to assess household food security conditions.   A severe macroeconomic crisis in Sri Lanka has caused acute shortages and spikes in the prices of essential products, including food, agricultural inputs, fuel and medicine, severely compromising economic activity, with major disruptions to agricultural production, were some of the findings of the report. Among the other findings were; paddy production forecast at three million MT in 2022, the lowest level since the 2017 drought-affected harvest, mostly due to low yields following reduced application of fertilisers.  Maize production; mostly used as animal feed, about 40 per cent below the past five-year average with negative effects on poultry and livestock production, likewise, production of vegetables, fruits and export-oriented crops, such as tea, rubber, coconut and spices, well below average, causing significant declines in households’ income and export revenues. Prices of most food items have been on a steady rise since the last quarter of 2021 and reached a new record high in August 2022, with the year-on-year food inflation rate at nearly 94 per cent. Mission recommendations: “Immediate provision of food or cash-based assistance to vulnerable and marginalised communities, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, women-headed households and persons with disabilities, to help them meet their immediate food and nutrition needs and agricultural inputs, including fertilisers, focusing on smallholder farmers.”   The report outlines the need to support households establish home gardens and backyard gardening to enhance their nutritional status, while providing adequate amounts of fuel to ensure effective planting, harvesting, transportation and processing of food crops. It also suggests providing high-nutrient animal feed, vaccines and veterinary health kits at subsidised price to livestock owners, especially dairy and poultry to mitigate the impacts of the feed shortages. Support for the resumption and continuation of national nutrition programmes such as school meals which faced disruptions due to funding constraints, were also highlighted as a priority, the statement said."

This was when the Petitions were taken before Supreme Court Justices L.T.B. Dehideniya, A.H.M.D. Nawaz and Shiran Goonaratne yesterday (12). While the Counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney General moved to file limited objections, the petitioners said they would file counter objections if required. As the second day of the first Test match between Australia and Sri Lanka was delayed due to adverse weather, a group of protesters started chanting anti-Government slogans including ‘Go home Gota’ on the city side of the Galle Fort ramparts overlooking the Galle Stadium when they were removed by military personnel. The petitioners noted the said protest did not cause any disturbance whatsoever to the cricket match, to its spectators or other tourists visiting the Galle Fort. They further said, the protesters were verbally abused and threatened by officers of the Sri Lanka Army in the presence of the Police officers and thus the said conduct of the officers amount to an infringement of the freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment as guaranteed to them by Article 11 of the Constitution. The Petitioners stated that the use of Army personnel to disrupt peaceful protests, protected by the law, is an infringement of the right to equality and the equal protection of the law as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution. ‘’The conduct of the military personnel in such a manner amounts to disgraceful and dishonourable conduct and is damaging to the reputation of the Sri Lanka Army and outside its scope and ambit and should not be permitted,” the petitioners noted.

He said, printing money to cover the budget deficit is a major cause of current inflation. This is why international money lending institutions have advised the Government to reduce public expenditure through tactics such as subsidy cuts and reducing the number of State employees, he added. At a press conference yesterday (12), Gammanpila said that appointing Ministers and State Ministers will increase the cost to the government even more. “How do other countries see the increase of government expenditure? The Government recently named 37 new State Ministers. These international institutions will think that if Sri Lankan Government does not want to overcome the economic crisis, why they should we assist the country,” he said. In addition, he highlighted that some may argue that the President can appoint up to 40 State Ministers, rather than 37. “It is true that the Constitution allows for the appointment of 40 State Ministers. But, in this crisis, is it necessary to appoint 37 State Ministers? Nowadays, the cost of living has increased threefold. How justified is it to allow Ministers and MPs to enjoy themselves while claiming that the future is very difficult for the people?” he asked. BY Thameenah Razeek"

He said, he will convene Parliament to state unequivocally that they must agree on electoral reform, despite the fact that the parties are arguing among themselves. He made these remarks during a meeting with Samantha Power, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), who is in Sri Lanka on a two-day official visit. The President also said they will bringanti-terrorist legislation. “I am calling the Parliament to declare unequivocally that they must agree on electoral reform. This has been going on for a while. The parties are arguing with one another. I give them a six-month period. If they do not, I will hold a referendum to determine which system the country prefers. Political parties cannot continue to put this off indefinitely. They will have to bite the bullet at some point. So, if they refuse, I will hold a referendum on the major reforms,” he said. The President also said former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Victor Ivan developed the grassroots concept of people’s councils. He added that they are providing them with whatever financial assistance they require, and that officials at the grassroots level have been asked to promote the concepts. “As a result, it will not be done by us. Even with the Galle Face movement, people at the village level must be allowed to express their opinions. So, in the 14,000 basic units, there will be 14,000 people’s councils,” he explained. He also said discussions have taken place with Tamils regarding detention under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. “We have agreed on a formula that will set off the period in detention against the judgement, and since they have all had more than ten years, no judgement will be more than ten years,” he said. He also emphasised the novel idea of including youth representation in committees, where their ideas will be given due consideration. “In addition to the Members of Parliament, there will be five youth representatives, all of whom are under the age of 35. They may ask questions through the Chairman, but they may not contribute to the main report. However, we are providing them with an addendum so that they can say whatever they want on the report. It will then be published. This is the first time it has happened in the world, and we must choose five members. We have a Youth Parliament that will legislate and bring it under the law,” Wickremesinghe said. The President also emphasised the need for anti-corruption legislation, which was recently approved, and the Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus has been asked to draft the Women’s Equality and Empowerment Bill. “I believe that is the first, and the first for the region. A private member’s bill to decriminalise homosexuality has been introduced. And I stated that the Government would not oppose it. We support it, but you must gain the support of individual members. It is a personal matter for them,” he added.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

The comparative figure in the five months from February 2021 to June 2021 was 176.7 million kgs. Sea fish production Year-on-Year (YoY) on a monthly basis in the five months from February to June 2022, for example, June 2022 over June 2021, has been continuously falling due to this crisis, statistics showed. Only in January 2022, YoY over January 2021 fish production has seen an increase in the year thus far. Fish production in January 2022 increased by 1.7 million kgs (4.83 per cent) to 36.9 million kgs, with the comparative figure for January 2021 being 35.2 million kgs. Consequently, fish production in the first six months of the year declined by 15 million kgs (7.62 per cent) YoY to 196.9 million kgs. The comparative figure of sea fish production for the first six months of last year was 211.9 million kgs. Consequently, Census and Statistics Department data showed that the retail price of a kg of dried sprats as at last month end had increased by nearly Rs 1,100 (119 per cent) YoY to Rs 2,000, fresh Salaya fish by more than Rs 450 (135 per cent) to Rs 800 a kg, and Kelawalla by nearly Rs 1,300 (113 per cent) to Rs 2,755 a kg. A recent FAO release quoting Fisheries State Ministry Secretary Jayantha Chandrasoma said, more than 50 per cent of animal protein requirements of Sri Lankans are obtained through fish consumption. “But the increase in fish prices has impacted negatively on the affordability of fish and fisheries-related products, particularly for low-income groups,” the release further quoting Chandrasoma said.

Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana said, the awarded supplier has decided to suspend contract performance until legal clearances are obtained, putting power generation at risk. He said it was decided to take legal action against individuals and companies engaged in misleading the public by spreading false claims on coal deals for political and financial gains. Minister Wijesekara met with officials from the Lanka Coal Company and contracted suppliers recently to discuss issues concerning the Lakvijaya Power Station’s coal procurement. “Contingency plans were also discussed to procure coal requirements for the following season if contracted suppliers are unable to supply the requirements,” he explained. According to a Ministry spokesman, a coal shipment should arrive this month; otherwise, Sri Lankans will face longer hourly power cuts in November because the Kelanitissa and Lakvijaya power stations won’t be able to function. He noted that the coal shipment should arrive soon as possible so power outages could be kept as short as possible. Meanwhile, Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Janaka Ratnayake warned that existing coal reserves will be depleted by the end of October, resulting in an increase in the number of blackouts. He noted that current coal reserves are only sufficient until 25 October and that if the Government does not take action to import enough coal by the fourth week of October, all three coal power plants will be forced to close.

The FAO, in a statement on Saturday (10), said, this new funding is going to help one million local farmers get the fertiliser and the agricultural necessities they need, just in time for the next planting season. The new funding, subject to Congressional approval, will bring the total USAID funding provided to the Sri Lankan people through FAO this year to USD 46 million. The funding primarily targets the forthcoming major cultivation season – 2022-2023 Maha (October-March) and the subsequent minor cultivation season – 2023 Yala (April-August). It will provide essential fertiliser and cash transfers for farmers to increase paddy production and avert a protracted food crisis. The new commitment was announced by Power at a discussion held with paddy farmers and FAO representatives on Saturday. The USAID Administrator said, “Today, having spoken to these farmers and heard about their needs, I’m announcing an additional USD 40 million in assistance to Sri Lanka from the American people. Through USAID, this new funding is going to help one million local farmers get the fertiliser and the agricultural necessities they need, just in time for the next planting season.”   FAO will utilise the funds to strengthen the production capacity of paddy rice farmers through the supply of Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) fertiliser. TSP, which has not been available in the country for the last two cultivation seasons, will be provided for all paddy farmers in Sri Lanka, to ensure the forthcoming agricultural seasons are able to feed the Sri Lankan people. In addition to TSP, USAID funding will provide 186,000 smallholder farmers with land holdings up to 1 hectare (2.5 acres), from the poorest districts in the dry and intermediate zones of Sri Lanka with 50 kilos of urea each. Smallholder farmers are among the most vulnerable rural communities, primarily cultivating rice for self-consumption. The lack of fertiliser over two consecutive seasons has significantly reduced yields, forcing most farmers to resort to extreme measures (pawning, buying on credit, dipping into savings, etc.) to meet their food security and nutrition requirements. Speaking on the announcement, Vimlendra Sharan, FAO Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives thanked the US for its timely and generous contribution to strengthen the country’s food capacity, especially those of the most vulnerable farmers to contribute toward enhanced paddy production over the coming seasons. He said, “Through the support provided by USAID, FAO will be able to strengthen food security in Sri Lanka by ensuring the forthcoming agricultural seasons are not compromised, while also protecting the most vulnerable smallholder farmers from the worst impacts of the prevailing crisis.”"

He expressed deep sadness over the detention and questioning of the three student activists, including Mudalige. He said people like Mudalige joined the protest movement because of their love for the country, and that the President and Prime Minister were appointed as a result of their long-term struggle. He said if the President is aware of Mudalige’s merits, he will take the necessary steps to release him without detaining him in this manner. “As far as I know, they are not guilty and if there is any accusation against them, they should not be detained in this manner, and legal action should be taken against them as soon as possible,” he said. Wannila Aththo also said that Mudalige protested on behalf of the people, but that later, certain politicians and individuals such as drug addicts, robbers and others joined the movement and sabotaged it. He noted that indigenous people live in 136 countries around the world and that before Mudalige’s detention becomes public, the President should ensure that he is released. He made the remark after a group of social activists met him to request that he urge the President to release the students who had been detained and interrogated under orders from the Ministry of Defence. The Vedda Chief also informed the social activists that while Mudalige’s father is not a member of the tribe, his mother is, and that he plans to meet the President and present the facts about his unfair detention soon.

Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He noted that Sri Lanka is an aging population and automation and semi automation is one way out for the country. He also noted that a 25-year programme has been planned from 2023, and that Sri Lanka will need the assistance of USAID for this to be successful. He also noted that as far as democracy is concerned, the 22nd Amendment is before Parliament. “We are waiting for Parliament to pass it. In administrations, we have brought out the first cabinet manual in Sri Lanka. Hence, that will have to go before the Cabinet and we’ll establish procedures for the whole of the Cabinet. The oversight committees are back again and we’ll be looking forward to support from the USA.” The President also said that increased economic committees from Public Finance; Committee on Public Accounts, Committee on Public Enterprise would include the Ways and Means Committee, and Committee on Banking and Finance because the banking sector is relatively weak and the Committee on State Enterprise Restructuring will start a parliamentary budget office and for the first time, legislative research service in Parliament.

Authorities, when contacted yesterday (8), lashed out that the MP had even written to President Ranil Wickremesinghe querying as to why a Medical Practitioner from the South had been appointed to the post when the relevant human resource for the position was available in the North. But owing to a dilemma within the Province, the Health Ministry had to make a decision and appoint the former Regional Director Health Services Colombo, Dr. D.H. Liyanage.  The fact is that the Health Ministry was placed in a bad wicket as the outgoing PDHS was unwilling to accept a Senior Medical Administrative Grade (SMAG) outside the Southern Province while the Regional Director Health Services in the North qualified to hold the position was unwilling to accept an ‘Acting Position,’ to temporarily fill in the PDHS posit. Sources said that while the Northern Deputy Provincial Director Health Services and the Director of Teaching Hospital Jaffna are qualified to take up the positions, the Deputy Provincial Director had turned the post down citing personal reasons as the Director of Teaching Hospital Jaffna had been in an ‘end post’. They said the Mannar and Mullaithivu Regional Director Health Services who were currently filling serving in Acting positions where qualified Consultants with Board Registration. However they too have not been promoted to SMAG. Sources said that the Northern PDHS (Acting), Dr. D.H. Liyanage, who assumed duties on Monday (05), was also a board qualified consultant. However, contrary to claims made by Wigneswaran and other self-interested politicians the Health Ministry had taken the decision to appoint Dr. Liyanage who was former Regional Director Health Services Colombo as the two Regional Directors from Mullaitivu and Mannar had been reluctant to work in an acting capacity.         Sources lambasted the Former Chief Minister for attempting to incite racism and discrimination. There were a large number of doctors and nurses from the South serving in the North while there is no reason why an administrative grade post should not be held by a medical practitioner from the South, sources added.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He noted that current coal stocks are only sufficient until 25 October, and that if the Government does not take action to import enough coal by the fourth week of October, all three coal power plants will be forced to close. Ratnayake told the Media yesterday (8) that the chosen coal supplier did not even submit the performance bond due to technical issues. He said, two shipments of coal are on their way and could be imported at a high cost, but there is nothing he can do. “The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) should be helped in their bid to get the coal they need to avoid power outages in October,” he said. He stated that if the CEB or the Government do not allow sufficient coal imports beginning in the fourth week of October, the country will lose nearly 900 MW of electric power to the main grid. He also claimed that there could be power outages even though the country has other sources of energy such as renewables like hydro and mini hydro. Speaking further on sufficient renewable energy and hydropower, he highlighted that the CEB is currently producing around 70 per cent renewable energy and that with sufficient rainfall in the hydro catchment areas, it can generate up to 60 per cent of the required hydropower. “Two of the three coal power plants are operational.

On 8 July 2022, a project team for the ‘evidence-gathering mechanism’ wanted to visit Sri Lanka and approached the Government to seek permission for the visit to discuss their work, but the Government had responded on 18 July indicating that given its rejection of resolution 46/1, a visit to the country could not be authorised. By 18 July Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Acting President at the time. The Government has already informed the OHCHR that they have rejected resolution 46/1, paragraph 6 that mainly talks about an evidence-gathering mechanism, as it could be used to prosecute troops guilty of war crimes as well as against the constitutional framework. The OHCHR has already mapped existing United Nations material, and integrated all of the material from the OHCHR Investigation onSri Lanka (OISL), where consistent with the applicable conditions and consent. The Office has also commenced identifying material held by other actors and engaging with information providers. To date, two organisations’ databases have been migrated into the repository, and negotiations with other information providers are ongoing.    The OHCHR said the Sri Lankan Government responded on 18 July 2022, indicating that given its rejection of resolution 46/1 that called for an evidence-gathering mechanism, the team cannot visit the country.  But the UNHRC said, it will continue to seek cooperation and request information from the Government in regard to this work.  The UN Rights Commissioner’s office said for long, successive governments have failed to ensure accountability for gross human rights violations and abuses and serious violations of international humanitarian law in Sri Lanka, especially where alleged perpetrators are state agents. Recognising “the importance of preserving and analysing evidence relating to violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes in Sri Lanka with a view to advancing accountability,” the Human Rights Council decided in resolution 46/1, paragraph 6 to strengthen the capacity of OHCHR “to collect, consolidate, analyse, and preserve information and evidence relating to violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes in Sri Lanka, and to advocate for victims and survivors, and to support relevant judicial and other proceedings, including in Member States, with competent jurisdiction.” The UN Rights Chief’s office said they had formed a dedicated project team to further strengthen its capacity in line with resolution 46/1 on the evidence-gathering mechanism and the team has been fully staffed and operational since May 2022, although the United Nations budget process impacted its configuration and delayed some recruitment. In carrying out this mandate, OHCHR is considering violations and abuses by all parties in Sri Lanka, and against any group, in any geographical area. It is also integrating a gender perspective and child-sensitive approach.  The report of the OHCHR further said they continued to develop the information and evidence repository using an e-discovery platform. This includes configuration to facilitate collecting, organising, crosschecking, collating, searching, and analysing large quantities of data from multiple sources to preserve material and support accountability efforts. The process of information collection requires great care and a victim-centred approach, the Human Rights Commissioner’s Office said. “The integration of material into the repository is carried out in line with United Nations regulations and policies and OHCHR’s procedures, and taking into account potential future requests for sharing of information.”  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

They indicated that by 12 April 2022 all outstanding debt obligations in Sri Lanka subject to this classification would indeed be restructured accordingly. According to already finalised IMF debt sustainability analysts (DSA), the IMF has focused primarily on restructuring only the Treasury Bill/Bonds Holdings of the CBSL on the principle that debt should be restructured on an equality basis with the participation of both foreign and local parties in order to achieve debt sustainability in Sri Lanka. As of yesterday, the Treasury bill/bonds holding of the CBSL was at 2.3 trillion rupee level. It is said that attention has been focused on transferring all or part of this to a special Bond and carrying out the relevant restructuring activities. According to sources, Lazard, the financial advisor to Sri Lanka’s debt restructure process, is confident that the required, minimum 75% consent of external commercial debt holders captured by the Committee of Creditors will agree to one of several scenarios involving a mix of ‘haircuts,’ lower rates, and longer duration on the aggregate $51 billion of external debt owed by Sri Lanka that is not being serviced. Talks with holders of ISBs are however, a more complex exercise with geopolitical implications. A clarification, sourced from the Government, is required here on the USD 51billion. Total Commercial Debt subject to restructure is put at USD 14.5 billion. It comprises USD 12.5 billion of ISBs issued by Sri Lanka and USD 1.4-2 billion of other debt obtained from commercial lenders such as the Chinese Exim Bank. Government sources also clarified that the External Public Debt subject to restructuring is put at USD 33.67 billion from which USD 9.38 billion is due to Multilateral Agencies such as World Bank, IMF and ADB. Such debt, government sources clarified that multilateral loans are not subject to restructuring as they carry mandatory repayment in full and carries no discounts. It also learnt that all foreign loans taken by Sri Lanka after April 12, as well as all short-term Central Bank swaps and obligations payable to the Asian Clearing Union shall not be restructured under any circumstance. All local Treasury Bills and Bonds, as well as Sri Lankan Development Bonds (SLDBs), are not subject to restructuring. However, maturing SLDBs are already being settled in local rupees. Thus, total external debt attributable to the Central Government is USD 24.29 billion to which must be added an amount of USD 1.4 billion being Chinese commercial debt obtained for the plant in Norochcholai thereby increasing it to USD 25.69 billion. It should be noted that the $25.69 billion excludes commercial debt on the balance sheets of other State-Owned Enterprises. Of the USD 25.69 billion noted above, 26% amounting to some USD 6.8 billion comprises debt owed to China indicating the size of the grip held by China on Sri Lanka. Negotiations with creditors for debt restructuring are now under way. According to sources, in order for the IMF Executive Board to approve Sri Lanka’s already announced economic adjustment package, bilateral lenders must support the debt restructuring process 100 per cent. Sri Lanka has reached a staff-level agreement (formal arrangement) with the IMF, offering access to 2.9 billion dollars over a four-year period. The agreement is a step toward persuading international creditors and investors to return to the country with a sustainable debt level, robust Macroeconomics  and governance environment. However, political observers stated that the political system is still in chaos, unable to unite on a clear framework that can inspire both internal and external confidence in implementing reform as an essential corollary of debt restructuring in order to receive and sustain IMF help and money. In April 2022, Sri Lanka became the first South Asian country to default in the pandemic era, struggling with debt that reached unsustainable level of 140% of its GDP. “Negotiations are required to choose between haircuts and extending the repayment period. And that negotiation will reflect the creditor’s preferences. Some creditors “may prefer to obtain their money sooner,” analysts said. “Others will choose not to have a haircut and instead have the money spread out over a longer period of time,” Africa and the Middle East have increased their share of government issuance, as have emerging Asia and the Pacific. However, ISBs may not be the optimum avenue to mobilise resources because overseas borrowing requires debt payment commitments in foreign currency. The increased reliance of developing countries on ISBs has not only contributed to a debt crisis, but has also made resolution nearly impossible. By Ishara Gamage"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

She was diagnosed with a type of cancer that spreads through the neck, contributing to her progressive deterioration. Dr. Thilak Premakantha, Director General of the National Zoological Gardens said, the tiger had been operated on once in the last few weeks on her neck. The surgery was performed by a team of veterinarians from the National Zoological Gardens to remove benign growths on the tiger’s neck that were causing her a lot of pain. Dr. Premakantha added that she had not recovered from her most recent operation. She died as a result of cancer-related complications. ‘Kella’ is the mother of three Bengal tiger cubs at Dehiwala Zoo named Akira, Duma, and Leo. Kella was brought to Dehiwala Zoo from the Xinjiang Safari Park, China in 2008 as part of an animal exchange programme, according to Dr. Premakantha. The veterinarians will perform an autopsy and other tests on her body. There are ten Bengal Tigers in Sri Lanka at present. By Thameenah Razeek"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Consequently yesterday, the administered market ‘spot’ was down by between 80-79.31 per cent (Rs 160-161), Year-on-Year (YoY), thereby causing cost-push inflationary pressure, as Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy, they said. Meanwhile, yesterday, the value of this official administered ‘spot’ was fixed at Rs 361.81 to the dollar, while a year ago it was fixed at Rs 207.35, down 74.49 per cent (Rs 154.46), YoY. In related developments, the straitjacketed, inflexible administered market ‘spot’ a year ago was fixed at Rs 200/203 to the dollar in two-way quotes.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/09/08/sri-lanka-might-restructure-all-bilateral-loans-isbs-and-cbsl-bill-bonds-holdings/,"Sri Lanka might restructure all bilateral loans, ISBs and CBSL Bill/Bonds holdings",Author not found,0,2022-09-07T20:30:00+00:00," Sri Lanka may consider restructuring all of its bilateral loans, International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), and Treasury Bill/Bond holdings of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in order to reach its International Monetary Fund (IMF) debt sustainability level within the next ten years (2023-2032), global capital market experts, revealed to Finance Today. They indicated that by 12 April 2022 all outstanding debt obligations in Sri Lanka subject to this classification would indeed be restructured accordingly. According to already finalised IMF debt sustainability analysts (DSA), the IMF has focused primarily on restructuring only the Treasury Bill/Bonds Holdings of the CBSL on the principle that debt should be restructured on an equality basis with the participation of both foreign and local parties in order to achieve debt sustainability in Sri Lanka. As of yesterday, the Treasury bill/bonds holding of the CBSL was at 2.3 trillion rupee level. It is said that attention has been focused on transferring all or part of this to a special Bond and carrying out the relevant restructuring activities. According to sources, Lazard, the financial advisor to Sri Lanka’s debt restructure process, is confident that the required, minimum 75% consent of external commercial debt holders captured by the Committee of Creditors will agree to one of several scenarios involving a mix of ‘haircuts,’ lower rates, and longer duration on the aggregate $51 billion of external debt owed by Sri Lanka that is not being serviced. Talks with holders of ISBs are however, a more complex exercise with geopolitical implications. A clarification, sourced from the Government, is required here on the USD 51billion. Total Commercial Debt subject to restructure is put at USD 14.5 billion. It comprises USD 12.5 billion of ISBs issued by Sri Lanka and USD 1.4-2 billion of other debt obtained from commercial lenders such as the Chinese Exim Bank. Government sources also clarified that the External Public Debt subject to restructuring is put at USD 33.67 billion from which USD 9.38 billion is due to Multilateral Agencies such as World Bank, IMF and ADB. Such debt, government sources clarified that multilateral loans are not subject to restructuring as they carry mandatory repayment in full and carries no discounts. It also learnt that all foreign loans taken by Sri Lanka after April 12, as well as all short-term Central Bank swaps and obligations payable to the Asian Clearing Union shall not be restructured under any circumstance. All local Treasury Bills and Bonds, as well as Sri Lankan Development Bonds (SLDBs), are not subject to restructuring. However, maturing SLDBs are already being settled in local rupees. Thus, total external debt attributable to the Central Government is USD 24.29 billion to which must be added an amount of USD 1.4 billion being Chinese commercial debt obtained for the plant in Norochcholai thereby increasing it to USD 25.69 billion. It should be noted that the $25.69 billion excludes commercial debt on the balance sheets of other State-Owned Enterprises. Of the USD 25.69 billion noted above, 26% amounting to some USD 6.8 billion comprises debt owed to China indicating the size of the grip held by China on Sri Lanka. Negotiations with creditors for debt restructuring are now under way. According to sources, in order for the IMF Executive Board to approve Sri Lanka’s already announced economic adjustment package, bilateral lenders must support the debt restructuring process 100 per cent. Sri Lanka has reached a staff-level agreement (formal arrangement) with the IMF, offering access to 2.9 billion dollars over a four-year period. The agreement is a step toward persuading international creditors and investors to return to the country with a sustainable debt level, robust Macroeconomics  and governance environment. However, political observers stated that the political system is still in chaos, unable to unite on a clear framework that can inspire both internal and external confidence in implementing reform as an essential corollary of debt restructuring in order to receive and sustain IMF help and money. In April 2022, Sri Lanka became the first South Asian country to default in the pandemic era, struggling with debt that reached unsustainable level of 140% of its GDP. “Negotiations are required to choose between haircuts and extending the repayment period. And that negotiation will reflect the creditor’s preferences. Some creditors “may prefer to obtain their money sooner,” analysts said. “Others will choose not to have a haircut and instead have the money spread out over a longer period of time,” Africa and the Middle East have increased their share of government issuance, as have emerging Asia and the Pacific. However, ISBs may not be the optimum avenue to mobilise resources because overseas borrowing requires debt payment commitments in foreign currency. The increased reliance of developing countries on ISBs has not only contributed to a debt crisis, but has also made resolution nearly impossible. By Ishara Gamage"

Addressing the media on Monday (5) SJB MP Harshana Rajapaksa noted that they, Weerawansa and the members of his new movement, are people who need to be held accountable for bringing the SLPP-led Government to the power.  “Do you remember the fancy stories they told comparing Gotabaya Rajapaksa to leaders like Mahathir Mohammad and Lee Kuan Yew? These people said they will build this country together. Now those who did this by inciting racism and sectarianism, showing off and spreading false racist news about Dr. Safi, are coming back in a new way. This is just like old wine inside new bottles,” he added. Meanwhile, Rajakaruna noted that the SJB parliamentary group has decided to establish a select committee to find the culprits behind the economic crisis. “It is essential to find out as to who is responsible for the crisis. It could be the political leadership or those in the Treasury or the then Minister of Finance. Also, the number of Cabinet ministers should not be increased at the moment when the country is in a deep economic crisis,” he added. In the meantime, Rajakaruna noted that ex-President Rajapaksa has no moral right to enjoy privileges granted to a former Head of State. He noted that if the former President has done his duty properly, it is okay to enjoy the privileges.  But that it is not ethical to enjoy all those privileges after not performing the duties properly and leading the country into an abyss, he stressed.

The High Commissioner also has encouraged the Government of Sri Lanka to continue consultations with civil society stakeholders in drafting these Laws, and to seek technical advice from her Office and relevant United Nations special procedures. In a long-awaited legal reform, Parliament passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) Amendment Bill on 22 March 2022. While the amendments improve some safeguards, they leave intact some of the most problematic provisions of the Act.  In June 2022, the Government announced it had been applying a de facto moratorium on the use of the PTA since March;   however in an alarming development three student leaders were detained under the PTA on 18 August 2022. Also, the Government informed the OHCHR that the Advisory Board established under Section 13 of the PTA in August 2021 has facilitated the release of 103 detainees charged under the PTA as of July 2022. According to information available to OHCHR, there remain 47 long-term prisoners under the PTA, 22 of whom are serving sentences and 25 of whom are at various stages of appeal; there are a larger number of detainees from recent years, particularly after the Easter Sunday attacks.  On 1 August 2022, the Government delisted six entities and 316 individuals who had been listed under counter-terrorism regulations, although three organisations and 55 individuals were added including the young Muslim poet, Ahnaf Jazeem, who was detained for eighteen months under the PTA before being released on bail in December 2021.

All these years, past governments gave these licences  to their close associates on a platter via backdoor deals. And they in turn sold these out to telco/media businesses and made millions of rupees for themselves, depriving the State of millions of dollars in revenue. Recently our neighbour India, auctioned their 5G spectrum and raised INR 1.5 trillion (US$ 18.99 billion). President Ranil Wickremesinghe has the opportunity to tell the world that Sri Lanka is ready to welcome FDI without corruption, red tape and the new Government is ready to show the world that Sri Lanka has changed and all transactions will be transparent by auctioning the 5G spectrum via an online auction system as done by India.

A delegation from HRB which was in Sri Lanka recently is reported to have made this request after meeting with Sri Lankan officials. Nevertheless, Sri Lankan authorities are reported to have rejected this request as government debt restructuring programme is still in progress. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA)  relating to the debt restructuring process in Sri Lanka was created and completed in compliance with the guidelines  of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) . According to DSA, Lazard, Sri Lanka’s financial consultants will disclose the relevant debt restructuring process to all creditors in the future. According to reports, connected ISB holders will have to consent to a 30% to 40% ‘hair-cut’ for ISB investments. Sri Lanka has 12.6 billion US dollars in Bonds. Domestic and foreign ISB holders already appointed international legal experts in preparation for the debt restructuring process. Sri Lankan Banks have also already made around 20% provisions for their ISB investments. “Under our unified debt restructuring programme, we cannot follow a separate debt settlement process for HRB or any other creditor. Regardless of whether the creditors are private or bilateral, we must apply the same equal debt restructuring policy to all creditors,” government sources said in the meantime, without referring to HRB’s request. Government sources also claimed that the Government was forced to reject another billion-dollar refinancing facility offered by China in respect of the China Development Bank’s one-billion-dollar loan maturing this year. HRB, which holds more than $250 million in Sri Lanka’s 5.875% ISBs due 25 July, filed the claim in late June in a New York Federal Court, seeking full payment of principal and interest. The Bank owns more than 25% of the Bonds, allowing it to veto any unfavourable changes to the notes under the terms of the indenture. It is alleged that HRB made the related investments despite the considerable risk in order to achieve large capital gains when Sri Lanka’s ISBs are sold at a heavily discounted price in the secondary market as was done in the recent past. “They could have earned a significant capital gain from their investment in Sri Lanka’s $500 million ISB settled in January under extreme difficult circumstances”. According to sources, “depending on the assurance they obtained from that investment, they may be blindly persuaded to make large investments in the ISBs that matured on July 25,” analysts said. However, the Sri Lankan authorities have yet to confirm who the final recipients of the $500 million ISB that matured in January are. Because the Sri Lankan government has been unable to identify who the final beneficiaries are since the ISBs were last traded in the Singapore secondary market. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka only has comprehensive information on the investors who purchased the initial ISB issue. On general, Sri Lankan ISBs are traded in global secondary markets. According to Sri Lankan officials, their ownership changes almost every transaction, making it difficult to gather information on their ultimate receipts from key overseas markets on their maturity date. However international fund managers opined that such ownership data is maintained by the bond trustees and the issuers (in this case the Sri Lankan government) can request for such information from the trustee. Meanwhile, HRB argued in their US Court filing that it is unlawful for Sri Lanka to temporarily suspend its external debt servicing from April 12, 2022, given that provisions for the settlement of the relevant maturing ISBs had been made aside in Sri Lanka’s Budget for the year 2022. As a result, in a context where confidence in the 2022 Budget has been completely undermined by manipulated data and unrealistic predictions, it has been the main challenge of Sri Lanka’s Attorney General’s Department to justify the temporary suspension of Sri Lanka’s external debt servicing from April 12, 2022 in the US courts with the assistance of their international legal experts, legal analysts said. Legal scholars believe that if the case is decided against the Sri Lankan government, its assets could be frozen.  When Finance Today enquired about this, Ministry of Finance officials stated that Sri Lanka’s external debt servicing was very poor since December 2021, a month after presenting FY2022 budget. The only viable solution to the balance-of-payments situation at that moment was to seek assistance from the IMF as Sri Lanka had lost access to global capital markets due to credit rating downgrades. However, the then-Sri Lankan government refused IMF aid, worsening the country’s foreign exchange crisis with significant import restrictions and shortages of essential goods. By Ishara Gamage"

The report acknowledges that Sri Lanka is at a critical juncture in its political life, amid a serious economic crisis which has severely impacted the human rights of all communities and people of all walks of life. “This has spurred broad-based demands by Sri Lankans from all communities for deeper reforms and accountability, and gives the Government a fresh opportunity to steer the country on a new path,” it said. For sustainable improvements to take place, however, it is vital to recognise and address the underlying factors which have contributed to the economic crisis, including embedded impunity for past and present human rights violations, economic crimes and endemic corruption, the Office of the Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) said. “Fundamental changes will be required to address the current challenges and to avoid repetition of the human rights violations of the past,” the report added. The report calls on the Government to immediately end its reliance on draconian security laws and crackdowns on peaceful protest, reverse the drift towards militarisation and show renewed commitment to, and deliver on, security sector reform and ending impunity. While the security forces recently showed considerable restraint in response to mass protests, the Government has since taken a harder line approach, arresting some student leaders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and violently suppressing peaceful protests.  A heavily militarised environment and culture of surveillance also continues in the north and east of the country. The report urges the new Government to re-launch a comprehensive and victim-centred strategy on transitional justice and accountability, with a time-bound plan to implement outstanding commitments, including taking steps in relation to the establishment of a credible truth-seeking mechanism and an ad-hoc special court.  Victims must be given a central role in the design and implementation of all accountability and transitional justice mechanisms. Expressing concern about the lack of progress to establish the truth about the Easter Sunday bombings in 2019, the report also calls for a follow-up independent and transparent investigation, with international assistance and the full participation of victims and their representatives, to pursue further lines of inquiry. “The Sri Lankan State, including through successive governments, has consistently failed to pursue an effective transitional justice process to hold perpetrators of gross human rights violations and abuses accountable and uphold victims’ rights to truth, justice and reparations,” the report states. “Rather, they have created political obstacles to accountability, and actively promoted and incorporated some military officials credibly implicated in alleged war crimes into the highest levels of government.” In the absence of progress towards accountability at the national level, the report urges other States to cooperate in accountability efforts, including by using available avenues of extraterritorial and universal jurisdiction, to investigate and prosecute crimes under international law committed in Sri Lanka. Additionally, the report urges States to explore further measures targeting those who are credibly alleged to have been responsible for gross violations and abuses of international human rights law or serious violations of international humanitarian law. The report outlines the progress of the OHCHR work on accountability, pursuant to Council resolution 46/1, and calls for reinforcement of its capacity. (SRM)"

I have a different opinion on this. This Bill will add more burdens to the people who are already suffering heavily. No one has been held accountable for this crisis.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

All these years, past governments gave these licences  to their close associates on a platter via backdoor deals. And they in turn sold these out to telco/media businesses and made millions of rupees for themselves, depriving the State of millions of dollars in revenue. Recently our neighbour India, auctioned their 5G spectrum and raised INR 1.5 trillion (US$ 18.99 billion). President Ranil Wickremesinghe has the opportunity to tell the world that Sri Lanka is ready to welcome FDI without corruption, red tape and the new Government is ready to show the world that Sri Lanka has changed and all transactions will be transparent by auctioning the 5G spectrum via an online auction system as done by India. I haven’t seen any suggestion or mention of anything on the 5G Spectrum auction. That means the new Government is still not looking out of the box for solutions.

A delegation from HRB which was in Sri Lanka recently is reported to have made this request after meeting with Sri Lankan officials. Nevertheless, Sri Lankan authorities are reported to have rejected this request as government debt restructuring programme is still in progress. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA)  relating to the debt restructuring process in Sri Lanka was created and completed in compliance with the guidelines  of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) . According to DSA, Lazard, Sri Lanka’s financial consultants will disclose the relevant debt restructuring process to all creditors in the future. According to reports, connected ISB holders will have to consent to a 30% to 40% ‘hair-cut’ for ISB investments. Sri Lanka has 12.6 billion US dollars in Bonds. Domestic and foreign ISB holders already appointed international legal experts in preparation for the debt restructuring process. Sri Lankan Banks have also already made around 20% provisions for their ISB investments. “Under our unified debt restructuring programme, we cannot follow a separate debt settlement process for HRB or any other creditor. Regardless of whether the creditors are private or bilateral, we must apply the same equal debt restructuring policy to all creditors,” government sources said in the meantime, without referring to HRB’s request. Government sources also claimed that the Government was forced to reject another billion-dollar refinancing facility offered by China in respect of the China Development Bank’s one-billion-dollar loan maturing this year. HRB, which holds more than $250 million in Sri Lanka’s 5.875% ISBs due 25 July, filed the claim in late June in a New York Federal Court, seeking full payment of principal and interest. The Bank owns more than 25% of the Bonds, allowing it to veto any unfavourable changes to the notes under the terms of the indenture. It is alleged that HRB made the related investments despite the considerable risk in order to achieve large capital gains when Sri Lanka’s ISBs are sold at a heavily discounted price in the secondary market as was done in the recent past. “They could have earned a significant capital gain from their investment in Sri Lanka’s $500 million ISB settled in January under extreme difficult circumstances”.

However, the Sri Lankan authorities have yet to confirm who the final recipients of the $500 million ISB that matured in January are. Because the Sri Lankan government has been unable to identify who the final beneficiaries are since the ISBs were last traded in the Singapore secondary market. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka only has comprehensive information on the investors who purchased the initial ISB issue. On general, Sri Lankan ISBs are traded in global secondary markets.

The report acknowledges that Sri Lanka is at a critical juncture in its political life, amid a serious economic crisis which has severely impacted the human rights of all communities and people of all walks of life. “This has spurred broad-based demands by Sri Lankans from all communities for deeper reforms and accountability, and gives the Government a fresh opportunity to steer the country on a new path,” it said. For sustainable improvements to take place, however, it is vital to recognise and address the underlying factors which have contributed to the economic crisis, including embedded impunity for past and present human rights violations, economic crimes and endemic corruption, the Office of the Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) said. “Fundamental changes will be required to address the current challenges and to avoid repetition of the human rights violations of the past,” the report added. The report calls on the Government to immediately end its reliance on draconian security laws and crackdowns on peaceful protest, reverse the drift towards militarisation and show renewed commitment to, and deliver on, security sector reform and ending impunity. While the security forces recently showed considerable restraint in response to mass protests, the Government has since taken a harder line approach, arresting some student leaders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and violently suppressing peaceful protests.  A heavily militarised environment and culture of surveillance also continues in the north and east of the country. The report urges the new Government to re-launch a comprehensive and victim-centred strategy on transitional justice and accountability, with a time-bound plan to implement outstanding commitments, including taking steps in relation to the establishment of a credible truth-seeking mechanism and an ad-hoc special court.  Victims must be given a central role in the design and implementation of all accountability and transitional justice mechanisms. Expressing concern about the lack of progress to establish the truth about the Easter Sunday bombings in 2019, the report also calls for a follow-up independent and transparent investigation, with international assistance and the full participation of victims and their representatives, to pursue further lines of inquiry. “The Sri Lankan State, including through successive governments, has consistently failed to pursue an effective transitional justice process to hold perpetrators of gross human rights violations and abuses accountable and uphold victims’ rights to truth, justice and reparations,” the report states. “Rather, they have created political obstacles to accountability, and actively promoted and incorporated some military officials credibly implicated in alleged war crimes into the highest levels of government.” In the absence of progress towards accountability at the national level, the report urges other States to cooperate in accountability efforts, including by using available avenues of extraterritorial and universal jurisdiction, to investigate and prosecute crimes under international law committed in Sri Lanka. Additionally, the report urges States to explore further measures targeting those who are credibly alleged to have been responsible for gross violations and abuses of international human rights law or serious violations of international humanitarian law. The report outlines the progress of the OHCHR work on accountability, pursuant to Council resolution 46/1, and calls for reinforcement of its capacity. (SRM)"

MP Imran said, the water bills of schools in the province have been paid by the Government to date, but he was alarmed to hear that the school administration must bear this cost going forward. Further, the SJB MP said, the Government gives Rs 1,200 to schools in the Eastern Province to pay the electricity bills every month, but a larger sum is given to schools in other provinces. “This amount is insufficient to settle the bills,” he added. “At a time when schools are facing various difficulties, refusing to pay the water bill is unethical and the Government should revisit its decision,” Imran stressed.

Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday (6), instructed the Chairman of PMB to investigate and take disciplinary actions against those responsible for the incident. Accordingly, based on the report obtained by the Chairman of the PMB, the Ampara Regional Manager was sent on compulsory leave while Amaraweera instructed the Chairman of PMB to investigate into the activities of the Ampara Regional Manager within two weeks. The PMB in 2020, instructed all regional managers to sell old stock of paddy held at paddy warehouses under the purview of the PMB for animal feed and the stock of 4,000kg of paddy bought in 2015 has been stored at the Aralaganwila warehouse, ignoring such instructions, without taking proper measures. ‘’If a public servant causes financial loss to the government and the country due to carelessness and inattention, he is no longer fit for public service,” Amaraweera noted. Amaraweera also instructed the Chairman of PMB to inspect paddy warehouses across the Island to find out if there are old stocks of paddy in such warehouses and give him a report immediately.

Food security has been identified as one of the most challenging issues during the ongoing economic crisis. The problem has been exacerbated due to the decline in domestic agricultural production and the rise in international prices. Under this situation, severe food shortages and price inflation can be expected in the future. As a result, food security will further deteriorate. Access to essential commodities has been further complicated by rising unemployment and the huge impact on household incomes in the wake of the present economic crisis. The capacity to purchase imported supplies has been limited due to the depreciation of the rupee and as a result, the prices of food may increase further. Accordingly, short-term national programmes have been developed to be implemented in the next two years as an urgent measure to ensure food security and nutrition. Accordingly, Cabinet approved the proposal presented by the President to establish a multi-sectoral integrated mechanism for food security and nutrition at the National Food Security and Nutrition Council and Provincial, District, Divisional, and Grama Niladhari Division levels to implement the said programmes efficiently and effectively Meanwhile, safe management of household waste and human waste, as well as institutional, commercial, and industrial waste and their collection, purification, disposal, as well as related health practices, are considered sanitation. The United Nations considers the provision of sanitary services as a vital requirement in the development of a country according to its Sustainable Development Goals Agenda. Accordingly, the national policy and the master plan on sanitation have been prepared by the Ministry of Water Supply with the consultation of the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Governments, along with other relevant parties.

But one cannot understand why they don’t pick up the low hanging fruits. The 5G spectrum is a good example. All these years, past governments gave these licences  to their close associates on a platter via backdoor deals. And they in turn sold these out to telco/media businesses and made millions of rupees for themselves, depriving the State of millions of dollars in revenue. Recently our neighbour India, auctioned their 5G spectrum and raised INR 1.5 trillion (US$ 18.99 billion). President Ranil Wickremesinghe has the opportunity to tell the world that Sri Lanka is ready to welcome FDI without corruption, red tape and the new Government is ready to show the world that Sri Lanka has changed and all transactions will be transparent by auctioning the 5G spectrum via an online auction system as done by India. I haven’t seen any suggestion or mention of anything on the 5G Spectrum auction. That means the new Government is still not looking out of the box for solutions. We need to think how we can attract investors of repute if we want to build a new economy with exports and get 10 to 15 Billion US$ investment in the next two to three years. “Over to you Mr President and your advisers to send the right message to the International community”.

He noted that the goodwill between the two countries was seriously damaged in the incident and that as a solution, the option of importing chemical fertiliser from the same company instead of the contaminated organic fertiliser was suggested but the company only manufactures organic fertiliser. Thereby, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been called on to set up a suitable process to uphold bilateral ties with the matter to be discussed with the Chinese Ambassador. Previously, China’s Qingdao Seawin Biotech Group instructed Sri Lanka to either accept the shipment of organic fertiliser or pay a sum of USD 1.5 million for the defamation caused to their company. Further, commenting on a report issued by the Auditor General recommending blacklisting the company, Amaraweera added that if such report has been issued, it should be submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Parliament.

CMLSSL President Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (5) noted however that there were more than 50 qualified medical administrators to fill those vacancies. They have been trapped at the secondary level for a long period, unable to move up the line in the medical administration service, he observed noting that further extension of the age of retirement would only prolong this crisis. Extending the age of retirement and thereby increasing the number of employees by 20% is a very dangerous challenge the country faces considering the present economic environment and conditions of international organisations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He noted the government was merely courting further hardships by restricting recruitment of newly-passed graduates citing difficulties in payment and retaining those who are due for retirement. The moment an organisation like the IMF calls for restructuring, the Government would only have to adopt harsh measures like calling for retirement and retrenching its work force, the CMLSSL President pointed out.   “The decision is advantageous to enable the flow of the medical administrative service and to modernise administrative decisions based on new knowledge,” he observed. But inaccurate information is presented to the President and the Secretary of Health since several officials who are above 60 years of age made the representations regarding the Health Ministry. Kumudesh further noted that about 90% of the specialist medical service in hospitals illustrate the same characteristics as the afore-mentioned medical administrative service mechanism as qualified specialist doctors with new knowledge strategies  were forced to remain behind the lines for a long time, discouraging them enough to leave the country.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Workers say they are facing starvation due to rising prices. Plantation workers complained that they work as tea estate labourers for Rs 700-800 per day and can only afford one and a half kilos of rice and one kilo of wheat flour. “There are at least three to four children in one family, especially in homes of plantation workers and now they cannot provide food and drink to their dependents.These people eat roti in the morning and prepare large roti for lunch and dinner, and they are only used to eating rice at night.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Liyanawaduge said a recent survey has revealed that many Sri Lankan elders who need cataract surgeries are unable to get their surgeries done at private hospitals due to high cost and non-availability of lenses in Government hospitals. This prompted HelpAge to provide these lenses to needy patients through Government hospitals countrywide, so that they could get their eye surgeries done at nearest hospitals. He said in addition HelpAge also conducts about 15 to 20 free cataract surgeries, for people over 55 years,  almost every day at the HelpAge Eye Hospital in Wellawatta, Colombo 6.

According to a media release from the Ministry of Agriculture, 248,000 hectares of paddy lands were cultivated until about a month after the start of the Yala season this year due to a shortage of chemical fertilisers and a lack of trust among farmers in some organic fertilisers. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture estimated that 275,000 hectares of paddy land were available for cultivation. In a discussion about cultivation activities in the Maha season held last week, the Irrigation Department and the Mahaweli Authority stated that 100 per cent of the paddy lands under Mahaweli and major irrigation were cultivated in the Yala season. Last week, a discussion on the distribution of urea fertiliser during the Yala season was held under the patronage of Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera.

The North Central Province had the most paddy fields cultivated during the Yala season. As a result, 9,623 metric tons of urea fertiliser has been delivered to that province. However, the Indian Government provided 65,000 metric tons of urea fertiliser, with an additional 35,000 metric tons remaining. The distribution of fertiliser for the Maha season’s cultivation activities has already begun, with the Ampara District of the Eastern Province receiving it. According to Minister Amaraweera, the Government has decided to provide urea fertiliser for maize, potato, and tea cultivation, in addition to paddy cultivation."

According to a Ministry spokesman, this has been going on for a long time, and if it continues, the CPC will not receive funds from dealers to import fuel. He said if dealers hand over post-dated cheques with a maximum of seven days, they will not have to discontinue the fuel in credit facility. He explained that in order to receive fuel the following day, they needed to ask dealers to deposit money the day before. The main reason for the return of fuel lines outside filling stations, according to Naotunna, is that petroleum dealers lack the financial means to pay for the fuel loads for their filling stations. He noted that they must deposit Rs 6 million with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation by 9:30 a.m. on days when the petrol bowser arrives at the fuel station. He asserted that the dealers are having trouble paying for the fuel supply in cash because of the customary procedure and the poor financial situation.  He claimed that even banks, both State-owned and private, have ceased writing cheques, and that the CPC now demands cash in hand when purchasing fuel inventories. He claimed that on days when a dealer is able to get funds and place an order for fuel stock, the CPC occasionally forgets to dispatch a bowser. BY Thameenah Razeek"

The President also said, he will discuss with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund about other needs in the health sector including medicines. The report of the three-member committee appointed by the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) to look into the shortage of drugs in the country was handed over to President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the President’s Office on 3 September. This report was handed over during the special meeting between the Government Medical Officers’ Association and the President yesterday and the problems faced by the health sector and doctors were discussed at length. The report of the committee has identified the shortcomings in the coordination between the Ministry of Health, Medical Supplies Division, State Pharmaceuticals Corporation, State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation, and National Medicines Regulatory Authority. Therefore, the report also suggested that a coordination committee be appointed by the Ministry of Health and a monthly progress review be conducted. The report has also proposed to appoint a technical committee to study the recommendations of the Auditor General submitted within the last five years in order to solve the problems that have arisen due to the lack of action taken regarding the recommendations of the Auditor General’s reports in the last few years. Nearly 40 per cent of the Government’s expenditure on medicines is earmarked for the provision of medicines for cancer patients. Representatives of the Government Medical Officers’ Association pointed out that there is a shortage of medicines and insulin for cancer patients and steps should be taken to resolve the problem as soon as possible. The increase in drug prices has become a major problem in the country today and the need for a proactive decision by the Government to provide some relief for essential drugs and the problem that may arise from patients avoiding taking drugs or increasing visits to Government hospitals due to the increase in drug prices were discussed at length during the meeting. President Wickremesinghe also pointed out the need to expand and develop the facilities of Colombo National Hospital, Kalubowila Hospital, and Jayawardenepura Hospital as well as the need for policy change in the entire health sector. The Government Medical Officers’ Association also submitted their proposals to the President regarding the payment of additional duty allowances for doctors, official transport facilities for doctors and the revision of those allowances, the revision of the Government administrative circular regarding foreign leave and importing electric vehicles on tax concessions for public service professionals. The President was also informed about the introduction and development of medical tourism in Sri Lanka. They pointed out that there is a need to introduce a professional development programme to upgrade the grades of all universities including Rajarata, Peradeniya, Karapitiya, etc. approved by the University Grants Commission, and even though the universities offer such study courses, the service constitution of the Ministry of Health has not approved it. Therefore, the Government should take policy decisions regarding this matter. Attention was also paid to the changes to be made in the service constitution of doctors. The GMOA pointed out the difficulties in sending foreign exchange to students studying abroad, and the President emphasised that higher education policies in this country should be changed to earn foreign exchange. President’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake, President’s Senior Adviser on Economic Affairs R.H.S. Samaratunga, Trade Union Director General Saman Ratnapriya, and President of the Government Medical Officers’ Association Y.V.N.D. Sirisena and other members participated in the discussion."

Thus, 42 MPs who represented the SLPP sat with the Opposition and become independent. Chairman of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and former President Maithripala Sirisena said, according to the current situation in the country, an alliance led by the SLFP will have the greatest advantage in forming the next Government. The proposed amendments to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s (SLFP) constitution were unanimously agreed on by the party’s all-island working committee on 2 September. The SLFP working committee met before the 71st anniversary festivities began and Dayasiri Jayasekara, the party’s general secretary, submitted the proposed amendments to the SLFP constitution. The SLFP celebrated its 71st anniversary under the auspices of SLFP Chairman Former President Maithripala Sirisena on 2 September at the National Youth Services Council in Maharagama. Before the vote, Sirisena addressed the crowd and urged the all-island working committee of the party to support the suggested changes to strengthen the party. According to Sirisena, he has recently been inundated with complaints about the party’s lack of discipline. He added that while he accepts these complaints, amendments have now been put made to address the problems. Some have even accused him of being spineless and weak, which has resulted in the party splitting up. “According to the stipulations in the SLFP’s previous constitution, if anybody has breached party discipline, it can often take more than two years to investigate and take appropriate action. Therefore, I am not at responsible for inaction,” he said.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

The General Secretary said the AGM will be held under the theme ‘Let’s build together’ to bring the people and their representatives in Parliament and local government under one umbrella to resolve the economic crisis the country is confronting today while restoring the life of crisis impacted people to normalcy. UNP General Secretary Bandara made these remarks while addressing the media at ‘Sirikotha’, House UNP Head Quarters with regard to the arrangements made to hold the 76th AGM. “Sri Lanka had been under the dominations of foreign imperialists, including the Portugese, Dutch and British colonialists for more than 400 years. As the people of this country united then under the leadership of D. S. Senanayake, Sri Lanka got Independence on February 4, 1948 in just in two years. Once again the same situation has arisen in the country and there is a need to liberate the country from the prevailing economic crisis. The UNP has been vested this responsibility today”, Bandara said. He also said “Today the country has been left with a mounting loan burden. The annual economic growth rate has dropped to 7 per cent. The country has been brought to a begging level. President Wickremesinghe has invited everyone to unite to rebuild the country in a similar way as the late leader Senanayake did at that time”. The representatives of people, civil society organisations, political parties not represented in Parliament, trade unions and social service activists are invited to take part in the AGM and work in collaboration to achieve the development goals resolving every issue prevailing today, Bandara added. While addressing the media UNP Chairman MP Vajira Abeywardena said that President Wickremesinghe was of the view that support from at least 175 members in Parliament was vital to resolve the prevailing economic crisis to bring the country to normalcy.The 76th AGM is held under ‘Let’s build together’ theme  keeping this in mind. “We hope representatives of every political party and civil society would take part in the AGM to be held at Sugathadasa stadium. If we work in unison the economy of this country can be rebuilt,”Abeywardena added. While addressing the media, the president of the Eksath Lak Wanitha Peramuna (ELWP) Shanthini Kongahage said President WIckremesinghe was a courageous and skillful leader next to D. S. Senanayake and further claimed that he has the capability to resolve the burning economic crisis of this country. “At a time when the UNP is celebrating its 76th anniversary, we are proud to say that if there is a leader who has won the goodwill from the rest of the world, the credit of it must go to President Wickremesinghe. The support and contribution of women is vital to strengthen the economy of this country. Such a move had been taken during President J. R. Jayewardene’s regime. Once again such a need has arisen in the country today. Jayewardene was a great leader who provided employment to young women of this country setting up free trade zones and industrial parks across the country. President Wickremasinghe as a young energetic Minister joined hands with late President R. Premadasa to take development which had been limited only to the cities, across the country. The widows in villages and unemployed women in villages benefitted from it making a great contribution to the national economy. We invite every Sri Lankan without and differentiation to build the country”, Kongagage added. By Naalir Jamaldeen"

They said the price of a 450g loaf of bread and that of other snacks had been raised at various levels. Bakery owners claim that they must purchase flour from wholesalers to meet their baking needs. According to bakery owners, a 50 kg bag of wheat flour is sold at a maximum wholesale price of Rs 18,000 to Rs 20,000, but traders hoard the flour and sell it at a higher price when there is a market shortage. “Because there is no control price for wheat flour, wholesalers sell wheat flour at different prices,” they explained. “A 450-gram loaf of bread is sold at Rs 300-320, a bun at Rs 110 and a fish bun at Rs 140,” they said. Although a large number of people worked in the bakery industry in the Nuwara Eliya District, many have opted out because of the price of wheat flour and the resulting cost of bakery items, as people can ill afford to pay such exorbitant prices. Fasir Mohommed, President of the Hatton Restaurant and Bakery Owners’ Association, said “Inability to buy bakery products has hampered business operations”. Meanwhile, plantation workers claim that they are paid Rs 1,000 per day to work on tea estates but this is now insufficient to make their daily purchases, including a kilo of wheat flour or a loaf of bread. They said they work on tea estates and eat just two meals a day, which includes bread and wheat flour-based food. They said they were accustomed to eating wheat flour-based food such as ‘roti’ for many years because it was convenient for them to carry it to the estates and have it at meal time. According to them, people who live on the plantations eat ‘roti’ and drink coconut milk for breakfast and lunch, and this is the food consumed by their children. They urged the Government to provide plantation workers with a wheat flour subsidy. by Neeta PathmaKumari – Norwood"

The letter mentioned the scarcity of medical infrastructure in the Sovereign State of Shrikailasa, an island established and named by the spiritual leader.

India Today accessed the letter written to the President of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, in August 2022. Written by Nithyaprematma Ananda Swami, who claims to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Shrikailasa, the letter read as follows – “The Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH) His Divine Holiness Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam is in need of urgent medical care for a serious medical condition. After exhausting the medical facilities currently available in Kailasa, the doctors are still unable to diagnose the underlying medical condition. The SPH is presently in the Sovereign Land of Shrikailasa, which does not have the required medical infrastructure that is most urgently needed at this time.” This letter stated that Nityananda was critically unwell and required treatment, hence his followers are not only seeking political asylum for him, but medical help from Sri Lanka.

Therefore, they urged for Sri Lankan creditors to join together and support the country’s already announced IMF-backed debt restructuring process, in order to find an immediate solution for the country’s economic crisis and to avoid a possible humanitarian disaster with food and energy shortages. “The debt owed by Sri Lanka is unsustainable. Therefore, the existing debt must be restructured in order to improve Sri Lanka’s ability to repay its obligations. Accordingly, the effort requires the cooperation of all creditors,” Peter Breuer, IMF Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, said. “So prompt, creditor coordination and transparent collaboration is really key to advancing the debt restructuring efforts and to make this interim period as short as possible. So, the objective really here in the interest of everybody is to get Sri Lanka once again, back on a path of strong and durable growth. And for that we really encourage everybody to work together to achieve that objective,” he said. He made these remarks during a press conference at the Central Bank’s Headquarters in Colombo yesterday (1). He warned that if Sri Lanka cannot achieve debt sustainability, with a border creditor support the country’s economic crisis will worsen without having proper external funding. As a result, in order to support Sri Lanka’s economic reform process, the IMF took steps on 31 August to reach a staff level agreement with Sri Lankan Government. Breuer also said, the 2023 Budget proposals must be consistent with the economic reforms programme and macroeconomic framework underlined by IMF, and that Sri Lanka needs a Government with a mandate to carry out reforms. He stated that the task of the financial and legal advisers of the Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring process is now to get the creditors’ approval of the debt restructuring action plan, which contains the criteria of debt sustainability in Sri Lanka and has been prepared in accordance with the staff level agreement. He said, the IMF will not intervene in the debt restructuring process. It is a process involving creditors and the Sri Lankan Government as the debtor. According to him, based on the creditors’ prompt response to the restructuring process, Sri Lanka can obtain approval from the IMF’s executive board to release 2.9 billion dollars subject to IMF economic evaluation for a period of 48 months. However, the majority of Sri Lanka’s external debt is held by non-Paris Club countries, such as China and India. As a result, the restructuring process must be approved by all relevant parties. China has so far not agreed for debt restructuring. Instead, China has expressed its willingness to refinance Sri Lanka to repay its past loans without any changes. By Ishara Gamage"

The announcement was made at the end of the mission conducted from 24 August in Colombo, where the IMF staff team for Sri Lanka held numerous meetings with the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, to agree on a package of reforms aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability and public finance sustainability in the country. The agreed economic reform package is designed to address comprehensively the challenges currently faced by Sri Lanka. The programme’s objectives are (i) to restore public finance sustainability through fiscal adjustment and debt restructuring, while protecting the most vulnerable and preserving financial stability, (ii) to bring back price stability and build external buffers, and (iii) to unlock the country’s growth potential through structural reforms and improvement in governance. Reaching Staff-Level Agreement with the IMF was one of the immediate objectives of the Government and a directive by the President since he was elected last month. The Authorities will now work on implementing the prior actions agreed under the SLA and on securing the financing assurances needed from Sri Lanka’s official bilateral creditors in order to obtain adoption of the programme by the IMF Executive Board. The Authorities have been working with their  international  financial  and  legal advisers on their debt restructuring strategy. The Authorities  further  intend  to  make  a  presentation to creditors in the next few weeks to update them on the most recent macroeconomic developments in the country, the main areas of  the  reform  package agreed with the IMF staff and the next steps of the debt restructuring process."

Our commitment is what matters now and we should not only fulfil the targets here, but we must get ahead of them,” the President said, adding, “I appeal to the country, let us reorient ourselves to an export-oriented economy which will also make it easier for us to sustain our social services.” He also said, it also should be a beginning for the fact that Sri Lanka should reduce its debts and if possible, even eliminate its debts. The President noted that if the country is to uphold Article  9 of the Constitution, it must follow that path. “You can’t pay lip-service only. And let this be the beginning and the way forward because on the 75th Anniversary of our Independence this, is the best commitment we can make for the next 25 years.”"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

Prior to Tuesday, the last time Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) offered the 2031 maturity to the market was a month ago on 28 July. CBSL sold the total parcel of Rs 25,000 million offered at Tuesday’s auction. However, vis-à-vis the other parcel on offer at Tuesday’s auction, namely the 2025 maturity, only 16.29 per cent (Rs 2,443 million) was sold to the market compared to its original offer Rs 15,000 million, in CBSL’s bid to contain yield pressure.  The WAY fetched for the 2025 maturity at this auction was 29.16 per cent, up 71 bps compared to the WAY of 28.45 per cent fetched at the 28 July auction. Meanwhile, at the 10 August auction, the interim T Bond auction held between Tuesday and the 28 July auction, where the 2025 maturity was then too offered to the market, however, CBSL, at the 10 August auction, rejected all offers made for the 2025 maturity because of higher WAYs asked for by the market. The 2031 maturity was not offered at the 10 August auction. CBSL is the steward of Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) debt. Issuing of T Bonds and T Bills to the market is a popular way that GoSL raises rupees from the domestic market. Investing in T Bonds and T Bills are risk free, because in the event that GoSL is unable to honour such debt, CBSL is mandated to print demand pull inflationary money and repay such creditors.

Consequently, GoSL’s FVMP debt increased by 0.38 per cent (Rs 12,045 million) to Rs 3,195,701.89 million (Rs 3.195 trillion) on Tuesday. A Higher value than this took place on 8 July where GoSL’s FVMP debt was recorded at Rs 3.25 trillion. However, yesterday’s increase was non-demand pull inflationary as it was used to meet an external commitment. The country’s foreign reserves haemorrhaged by US$ 33.68 million (Rs 12,173 million) led by the settlement of payments made for “essential” imports on Tuesday. Conversions are based on the administered “spot” value which was Rs 361.40 to the US dollar.  GoSL’s at least theoretical MP borrowing costs (BCs) fell by 0.02 per cent (Rs 27.65 million) to Rs 137,819.54 million on Tuesday despite the increase in its FVMP debt,  led by buying pressure of Treasury T Bills and T Bonds in secondary market trading due to higher yields offered. Market was short for a record 240 market days to  Tuesday,  with this shortfall increasing by 0.02 per cent (Rs 128 million) to Rs 612,043 million, thereby causing  sustained rate pressure. GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs three trillion for a record consecutive 38 market days to Tuesday due to a sustained lack of revenue.  Also, GoSL’s highest to the 243rd highest FVMP debt has been registered for a record 243 market days to Tuesday. Transactions between the CBSL and the GoSL are foreign reserves neutral and CBSL which administers daily open market operations; lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL.  GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. “Spot” trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in “spot.” The “spot” is administered to minimize GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and lower the cost of “essential” imports, while “essential” imports are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee as Sri Lanka is an import dependent economy.

Acknowledging India’s efforts to help Sri Lanka cope with its worst economic crisis, Moragoda said, in an interview, that New Delhi will continue to play a crucial role in aiding the island nation’s recovery, including investments and assistance with bridging finance till Colombo finalises a bailout package with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “Very clearly, India is the anchor when it comes to security in this region, on that there is no issue. As the security guarantor of the region, India is the anchor,” Moragoda said on the row stirred up by the visit by Yuan Wang 5, a satellite and missile tracking vessel, to the Chinese-controlled Hambantota port in mid-August. Against the background of heightened tensions and rivalry between India and China in the region, Sri Lanka wants all players to “get along” even as it focuses on its own development and maintenance of its sovereignty, the envoy said as he completed his first year in New Delhi on Tuesday. “We should not want in any way any threat to our sovereignty,” he said. Moragoda emphasised the need for a “clear dialogue” between Sri Lanka and India on matters across the board. “Earlier, ship visits were not taken very seriously…But I think we have to move beyond that and we have to develop some kind of framework to ensure that this type of incident [or] misunderstanding on security does not occur,” he said. He cited Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan’s remarks about smaller countries having to rethink policies in response to a “dangerous phase” in geopolitical tensions, and said while Sri Lanka occupies a strategic position, it needs to have a clear understanding with India regarding bilateral relations. “The fact that we will not allow Sri Lankan soil or maritime space to be used against India in any way or in a way that is a security threat for India, that has been an understanding throughout…and India also has given the same assurance in 1987 that her soil will not be used against us,” he said. Moragoda described India as a “logical partner” for Sri Lanka’s efforts to overcome the country’s economic crisis, including in efforts to acquire bridging finance and investments in sectors such as tourism. “India, I must stress, has really supported us at every turn in the past eight or nine months. If not for India, we would have had a serious problem because when it came to fuel and food and when it also came to foreign exchange, India backed us up. So that is something as a country, we appreciate and we are grateful for,” he said. Since the beginning of the year, India extended aid worth $3.8 billion, including lines of credit, a currency swap and deferring of loan repayments, to Sri Lanka. Moragoda said the tough times are not over for Sri Lanka, as it has to contend with both structural issues such as reforms of State-run enterprises and the power sector, and the restructuring of bilateral and multilateral debt. “Unless these things are done, Sri Lanka can’t move forward. Ultimately we have to look at efficiency and at becoming an export economy and fitting somehow into global supply chains,” he said. “We are looking to see what is possible with India. There are different ways of approaching it – not necessarily loans alone, but investments. Maybe we look at even rupee trade,” he added. Widespread public protests in Sri Lanka resulted in the resignation of former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who left the country in August. The administration of the new President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, is now focusing on the implementation of India-backed projects such as the Trincomalee oil farm and a national ID card scheme. Moragoda, who took the unusual step of issuing a strategy paper for reshaping bilateral relations before coming to New Delhi, said there is also fresh momentum on connectivity projects and the two countries are discussing the possibility of building an energy pipeline between the Trincomalee oil farm and the Indian side. Sri Lanka will soon operationalise its Consulate General in Kolkata and plans to appoint honorary Consuls in Gujarat and Odisha as part of measures to increase the country’s footprint in Indian states, he said. There are also plans to compile a directory in Sinhala of all Buddhist sites in India to encourage more visits from the Sri Lankan side, he said. (Hindustan Times)"

In a letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, CMLSSL President, Ravi Kumudesh yesterday (1), alleged that the main reason for the inefficiency in the health service was the change in policy decisions taken in accordance to political and administrative powers. There are many cases where medical administrators have misled the government by acting in a partial and biased manner, it said. In the letter copied to Ministers Health and Public Administration, Secretaries Health, Finance Ministry and the Director General Health Services, Kumudesh alleged that the situation had affected patient centred responsibility. “It has already been observed that various parties are trying to change the retirement age set by the interim budget for state employees,” he alleged noting that the Ministry alone was able to present the required justifications to do so. However, the CMLSSL stressed that the retirement age decided by the interim budget should apply to the health service as well – failing which there would be severe disparities between the professions, the CMLSSL President lamented. “Although there maybe parties opposing the decision to reduce the retirement age, let us point out that the Government should not turn the policy into a joke like during the former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s tenure,” he said warning  that if it did the situation would  be serious enough to trigger trade union action.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/09/02/fvmp-debt-rises-to-2nd-highest-value-of-rs-3-195t/,FVMP Debt Rises to 2nd Highest Value of Rs 3.195T,Author not found,0,2022-09-01T20:30:00+00:00," Government of Sri Lanka’s (GoSL’s) face value money printing (FVMP) debt rose to its second highest value on Tuesday (30 August) due to a sustained lack of revenue. Consequently, GoSL’s FVMP debt increased by 0.38 per cent (Rs 12,045 million) to Rs 3,195,701.89 million (Rs 3.195 trillion) on Tuesday. A Higher value than this took place on 8 July where GoSL’s FVMP debt was recorded at Rs 3.25 trillion. However, yesterday’s increase was non-demand pull inflationary as it was used to meet an external commitment. The country’s foreign reserves haemorrhaged by US$ 33.68 million (Rs 12,173 million) led by the settlement of payments made for “essential” imports on Tuesday. Conversions are based on the administered “spot” value which was Rs 361.40 to the US dollar.  GoSL’s at least theoretical MP borrowing costs (BCs) fell by 0.02 per cent (Rs 27.65 million) to Rs 137,819.54 million on Tuesday despite the increase in its FVMP debt,  led by buying pressure of Treasury T Bills and T Bonds in secondary market trading due to higher yields offered. Market was short for a record 240 market days to  Tuesday,  with this shortfall increasing by 0.02 per cent (Rs 128 million) to Rs 612,043 million, thereby causing  sustained rate pressure. GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs three trillion for a record consecutive 38 market days to Tuesday due to a sustained lack of revenue.  Also, GoSL’s highest to the 243rd highest FVMP debt has been registered for a record 243 market days to Tuesday. Transactions between the CBSL and the GoSL are foreign reserves neutral and CBSL which administers daily open market operations; lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL.  GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. “Spot” trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in “spot.” The “spot” is administered to minimize GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and lower the cost of “essential” imports, while “essential” imports are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee as Sri Lanka is an import dependent economy.

Acknowledging India’s efforts to help Sri Lanka cope with its worst economic crisis, Moragoda said, in an interview, that New Delhi will continue to play a crucial role in aiding the island nation’s recovery, including investments and assistance with bridging finance till Colombo finalises a bailout package with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “Very clearly, India is the anchor when it comes to security in this region, on that there is no issue. As the security guarantor of the region, India is the anchor,” Moragoda said on the row stirred up by the visit by Yuan Wang 5, a satellite and missile tracking vessel, to the Chinese-controlled Hambantota port in mid-August. Against the background of heightened tensions and rivalry between India and China in the region, Sri Lanka wants all players to “get along” even as it focuses on its own development and maintenance of its sovereignty, the envoy said as he completed his first year in New Delhi on Tuesday. “We should not want in any way any threat to our sovereignty,” he said. Moragoda emphasised the need for a “clear dialogue” between Sri Lanka and India on matters across the board. “Earlier, ship visits were not taken very seriously…But I think we have to move beyond that and we have to develop some kind of framework to ensure that this type of incident [or] misunderstanding on security does not occur,” he said. He cited Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan’s remarks about smaller countries having to rethink policies in response to a “dangerous phase” in geopolitical tensions, and said while Sri Lanka occupies a strategic position, it needs to have a clear understanding with India regarding bilateral relations. “The fact that we will not allow Sri Lankan soil or maritime space to be used against India in any way or in a way that is a security threat for India, that has been an understanding throughout…and India also has given the same assurance in 1987 that her soil will not be used against us,” he said. Moragoda described India as a “logical partner” for Sri Lanka’s efforts to overcome the country’s economic crisis, including in efforts to acquire bridging finance and investments in sectors such as tourism. “India, I must stress, has really supported us at every turn in the past eight or nine months. If not for India, we would have had a serious problem because when it came to fuel and food and when it also came to foreign exchange, India backed us up. So that is something as a country, we appreciate and we are grateful for,” he said. Since the beginning of the year, India extended aid worth $3.8 billion, including lines of credit, a currency swap and deferring of loan repayments, to Sri Lanka. Moragoda said the tough times are not over for Sri Lanka, as it has to contend with both structural issues such as reforms of State-run enterprises and the power sector, and the restructuring of bilateral and multilateral debt. “Unless these things are done, Sri Lanka can’t move forward. Ultimately we have to look at efficiency and at becoming an export economy and fitting somehow into global supply chains,” he said. “We are looking to see what is possible with India. There are different ways of approaching it – not necessarily loans alone, but investments. Maybe we look at even rupee trade,” he added. Widespread public protests in Sri Lanka resulted in the resignation of former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who left the country in August. The administration of the new President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, is now focusing on the implementation of India-backed projects such as the Trincomalee oil farm and a national ID card scheme. Moragoda, who took the unusual step of issuing a strategy paper for reshaping bilateral relations before coming to New Delhi, said there is also fresh momentum on connectivity projects and the two countries are discussing the possibility of building an energy pipeline between the Trincomalee oil farm and the Indian side. Sri Lanka will soon operationalise its Consulate General in Kolkata and plans to appoint honorary Consuls in Gujarat and Odisha as part of measures to increase the country’s footprint in Indian states, he said. There are also plans to compile a directory in Sinhala of all Buddhist sites in India to encourage more visits from the Sri Lankan side, he said. (Hindustan Times)"

He said many argue that privatising strategically important State-owned enterprises endangers national security and energy security, and that having a fund like this will protect these institutions. Speaking to the media yesterday (31), Gammanpila claimed that while the Interim Budget that mentions restructuring of State-owned enterprises was presented to Parliament, it does not specify how it will be accomplished. “There are numerous options for that. Businesses that aren’t strategically important and continue to lose money can be privatised. In addition, the Government can generate revenue by selling 25 per cent of the stock in profit-making State institutions. The Government can then earn a lot of money while maintaining its authority,” he explained. Further, he said if this is done, instead of generating revenue by minting money and increasing inflation, the Government can generate revenue without burdening anyone. According to Gammanpila, there is an opportunity to develop public businesses through the public-private partnership (PPP) strategy. “Some argue that privatising strategically important institutions endangers national security and energy security. When we transfer a business to the private sector, we sell it for a set period of time rather than selling it permanently. After a predetermined time period, it should be resold to the Government at a predetermined price. If we give that institution to the private sector for twenty years and those people develop it, the Government should be able to buy it after that time. For that, a ‘Strategic State Enterprise Redemption Fund’ must be set up by allocating a portion of the Budget each year,” he said. By Thameenah Razeek"

The prestigious and premier flying school of the Royal Ceylon Air Force was established on 1 September 1951 as the “Flying Wing” at the then Royal Ceylon Air Force station Katunayake. Since its inception the wing has been at the forefront in grooming young and enthusiastic men and women to become fully fledged military pilots. In 1951, four Canadian DHC-1 Chipmunk aircraft were inducted for flying duties. Five more Chipmunk aircraft and three British Airspeed Oxford aircraft were inducted in 1952 and 1953 respectively to supplement the capacity of the Flying Wing. In 1954, six British Balliol aircraft were inducted to enhance the wing’s training capacity. With the induction of Balliols, the Flying Wing, which only trained pilots in basic flying, was able to provide advance flying skills making a notable change in flying operations. In 1955 two new aircraft were inducted; namely the Scottish Prestwick Pioneer and the UK-built DH 104 Dove. In 1959, RCyAF Flying Wing became the first flying squadron to operate jet powered aircraft with the addition of 12 British Hunting Jet Provost aircraft thereby propelling the wing into a new era in flying. In 1963, the Flying Training school was shifted to China Bay which was a better airfield for training. In 1970, six American Cessna 150 aircraft were inducted for training as the Chipmunks were phased out. In 1984 three new aircraft types were inducted for both training and operational requirements. Hence, three Siai Marchetti Warriors, three Siai Marchetti 260TPs and three Cessna 337 Sky Masters were added. In 1988, due to the declined security situation in the East, the wing was relocated to SLAF Base Anuradhapura. In 1992, Argentinian IA 58 Pucara aircraft joined the wing to enhance the operational capability of the SLAF. On 1 March 2000, the wing was awarded President’s Colours by then President Chandrika Bandaranayake Kumaratunga. In 2001, the FTW aircraft fleet was expanded with the induction of six Chinese PT-6 aircraft to be used as an “Ab-initio” trainer. 22 October 2007 was a day to remember for all members of the Flying Training Wing and SLAF Base Anuradhapura as the LTTEs carried out a surprise attack on the hangar. The attack destroyed three PT-6 aircraft and one K-8 aircraft in the fleet. After the humanitarian conflict, the wing was shifted back to China Bay on 1 January 2009. In April 2010, No-14 Squadron which operated Chinese built K-8 aircraft was also merged. In 2018, six more PT-6 aircraft were purchased to further enhance the training capacity of the wing. The present Commander of the Sri Lanka Air Force, Air Marshal Sudarshana Pathirana served as a Qualified Flying Instructor during the year of 1999 and was a pillar of knowledge and strength to many aspiring young pilots of the Air Force. The first Commanding Officer of the wing was Flt Lt Norman Lush of the Royal Air Force and presently Wing Commander I.S. Mallawaarachchi commands the Flying Training Wing as the 33rd Commanding Officer. The wing operates three aircraft platforms at present, C-150 and PT-6 for Basic Flying training while K-8 aircraft are used for Advanced and Fighter Conversion Training. Other than providing flying training for cadets, the wing also caters with Flying Instructor Training and Basic Air Traffic Control Courses as well. More than 350 pilots have successfully completed their basic flying training and passed out from this prestigious institution. The premier flying school has been the cradle of military aviators in Sri Lanka for 71 years since its inception and it boasts of grooming many exemplary and extraordinary individuals to protect the skies of our motherland. It has met with all the standards expected from a flying training establishment for decades and will continue to do so for the generations to come."

At a  media brief held in Japan on 30 August, the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs Hayashi Yoshimasa was asked whether the Japanese Government is holding discussions on debt restructuring by bringing together creditor nations such as China and India as stated by the President of Sri Lanka to which the Foreign Minister responded that Japan is currently providing medicine and food aid to the country and have had  various exchanges with the Sri Lankan  government, but no preparations are being made with Sri Lanka on holding consultations on debt restructuring. Japan is paying close attention to the severe economic situation in Sri Lanka and in response to the worsening humanitarian situation in the country, we are currently providing humanitarian assistance such as medicine and food, the Foreign Minister added. “In the future, we believe that it is important for the Sri Lankan Government to work with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Paris Club to improve the country’s economic and financial situation while ensuring transparency,” he added. He further noted that Japan intends to further consider how to respond to this situation while keeping a close eye on such trends and the situation in the island, while consulting with the Sri Lankan Government, donors and international organisations. As a condition for a bailout, the IMF insisted that the Sri Lankan Government restructure its debt repayment to donor countries including Japan, China, and India among many others. Japan is one of the countries that are pushing Sri Lanka to obtain the IMF loan along with India and the US. In an effort to resolve Sri Lanka’s debt crisis, President Ranil Wickremesinghe declared earlier in August that he would pursue Japan to host an all creditors’ conference. He stated that he would speak with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo about the matter during his tour to Japan this month. In May, the Government of Japan provided Emergency Grant Aid of USD 3 million to Sri Lanka. Also, the first tranche of food assistance pledged by the Japanese Government earlier this year was provided through the United Nations World Food Programme to Sri Lanka. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Sri Lankans have faced acute shortages of fuel and other basic goods for months, leaving it in political turmoil and inflation which is now soaring at almost 65 per cent. The sources, who declined to be named ahead of an official announcement planned for Thursday (1), did not say how much money Sri Lanka might get but optimism around the news sent the country’s bonds to their highest level in two months. The IMF said its team, that has been in the country for a week, had extended its stay by a day and that a news conference would be at the Sri Lankan Central Bank on Thursday. “The IMF Mission in Colombo has been extended by one day because discussions are still ongoing with the authorities,” the IMF said in statement. The Government did not respond to requests for comment, although President Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament during the budget presentation on Tuesday (30 August) that talks with the IMF had reached the final stage. Staff-level IMF agreements, as they are known, need to get formal approval of its management and executive board before recipient nations get any funding."

Gorbachev, the last Soviet President, forged arms reduction deals with the United States and partnerships with Western powers to remove the Iron Curtain that had divided Europe since World War Two and bring about the reunification of Germany. But his internal reforms helped weaken the Soviet Union to the point where it fell apart, a moment that President Vladimir Putin has called the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the twentieth century. “Mikhail Gorbachev passed away tonight after a serious and protracted disease,” said Russia’s Central Clinical Hospital. Putin expressed “his deepest condolences,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Interfax. “Tomorrow he will send a telegram of condolences to his family and friends,” he said. Putin said, in 2018, he would reverse the Soviet Union’s disintegration if he could, news agencies reported. World leaders were quick to pay tribute. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said Gorbachev, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990, had opened the way for a free Europe. US President Joe Biden said he had believed in “glasnost and perestroika – openness and restructuring – not as mere slogans, but as the path forward for the people of the Soviet Union after so many years of isolation and deprivation.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, citing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, said Gorbachev’s “tireless commitment to opening up Soviet society remains an example to us all”.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/09/01/south-now-knows-the-danger-of-pta/,South now knows the danger of PTA,Author not found,0,2022-08-31T20:30:00+00:00," The draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) which has caused serious sufferingsto the Tamils of this countryhas now impacted other communities including the protesters and this is now being realised by the South, said former Parliamentarian and Leader of Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) Suresh Premachandran. Commenting on a statementmade by former foreign minister Prof G.L. Peiris who said that PTA should be repealed or the international community would isolate Sri Lanka, Premachandran said this shows that most politicians in the South are still not keen to repeal the PTA despite realisingit has been a draconian law. He further said that, since the PTA is seen as a draconian law and a cause of human suffering, the Government should revoke it and accept wholeheartedly that it has caused immense suffering for all Sri Lankans. “The PTA remained for 40 years or so despite being brought in as a temporary measure. The PTA could arrest anyone based on their opinions and wishes and it refrains from producing the person in the Court. They are detained by the Army, Police and the TID and torturedfor information. There are so much evidence how many had been tortured and taken statements against their wishes. The repealing of the PTA has been spoken so often and successive governments were under pressure to repeal it but it was never the case.” He said thousands of Tamil youth were arrested under the PTA and it was not disputed by the international community. “When the people went against bad governance and leadership, corruption and high cost of living, people decided to send off the rulers in a democraticway but it wasprojected as violence against the State. The incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe who came to power due to the protests has allowed arresting those who took part in the protest and detained them under the PTA,” he further said. The student movement’s leaders, trade unionists and many from the public were arrested under the PTA, he pointed out. He also recalled when the Tamil youth were arrested under the PTA, no southern politicians, trade unions or organisation voiced against the arrests. “Yet the Tamils of this country including me and several organisations protested when the Sinhalese were arrested under the PTA. To us,then and now, the PTA is a draconian Act and we as Tamils stand by those who are protesting against it,” he added. “The most interesting news is that Prof G.L. Peiris has openly said that such arrests under the PTA will give a wrong signalas the United Nations Human Rights Council session is around the corner. He told the media it would set path to the UNHRC to pressure Sri Lanka to implement the resolution. Hence the country should not arrest protesters under the PTA.” Prof. Peiris recently said that agitation is not a situation, in which the application of anti-terrorism laws is at all appropriate or justified. Premachandran said if this has been realised then the Government should take appropriate steps to repeal it. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Ekanayake said no prisoner is treated differently and no politically motivated officers can harm any prisoners, adding that no actions or investigations will be taken against any officials attached to Angunakolapelessa Prison. Addressing the Media, he flatly denied Ramanayake’s claim that the food served in prisons is subpar. Ekanayake emphasised that food should never be cooked with worm infested fish, sweat and phlegm, and that thousands of prisoners come and go from prisons every year, with no issues so far. He said if such a problem arises, inmates should notify the prison superintendent, chief jailer, or authorities. “During his one and a half year in prison, Ramanayake did not complain to prison officials about the condition of the food.I have been working in the Prisons Department for 37 years. I have never seen or heard of a cat falling into a lentil or broth on a single day of my service,” he said. The spokesperson assured that the hygiene of those who prepare food in prisons is good. Ekanayaka also issued a press release in this regard, stating that the selection of food suppliers to prisons under the Department is done through procurement process. The Prisons Department comes into a contract for the daily supply of food in accordance with the standards required. As a result, the officers will inspect the food provided by the relevant suppliers to make sure it meets the prescribed standards and quantities before they are brought into prison. In addition, PHIs and doctors assigned to prisons will conduct inspections as needed, and if substandard food items are identified, they will reject them without bringing them into the prisons, according to Ekanayake. He emphasises that after the food provided by the suppliers has been inspected at the prison gate and delivered to the kitchen, inmates do all the work under supervision, from cleaning to cooking and distributing it to fellow inmates. Furthermore, Ekanayake said in the relevant announcement that the chief jailer and the superintendent of the prison must inspect the food prepared for the inmates before it is issued, and would stop serving the meal if any irregularity is found.

According to a ministry spokesman, the re-emergence of fuel queues is due to three factors, one of which is the CPC’s delay that occurred last Thursday and Friday. He said the other two reasons are that Sunday is the last day to get the weekly fuel quota and Monday is the first day of the week to get the new quota. “The fuel queues observed over the past few days can be predicted as a result,” the official said. He did, however, reassure that there is enough fuel in the CPC’s inventory until the next fuel shipments arrive in the country. The final explanation he gave, was that people had once more started panic buying fearing re-emergence of queues. He said they will release 4,000 MT of diesel and 3,000 MT of petrol daily for filling stations. “Other than the above factors, I can guarantee you that there is no fuel shortage, and the queues will disappear within a few days as well,” he said. After an initial lessening of queues following the adoption of the National Fuel Pass from 1 August, Sri Lanka is once again experiencing long queues outside fuel stations.  By Thameenah Razeek"

They called for an inquiry to be conducted by the HRCSL in accordance to section 14 of the Human Rights Commission Act No. 21 of 1996 into the infringement of the Fundamental Rights of the citizens due to the attack on 9 May and the use of the PTA to arrest and detain anti-Government protesters. They emphasised on the failure of the law enforcement authorities to effectively and efficiently apprehend and prosecute the instigators and the perpetrators of the violence unleashed on peaceful protestors on 9 May 2022 in the vicinity of Temple Trees and thereafter at Galle Face followed by the use of the PTA to arrest and detain protesters. ‘’The People’s Assembly is deeply concerned about many incidents that have taken place in the country where there has been prima facie evidence of violation of fundamental rights of those aggrieved, either as a result of inaction on the part of the law enforcement authorities or by the misuse of the law to stifle peaceful protest and dissent’’ they noted. They thereby called on the HRCSL to investigate the infringement of fundamental rights by the attack on peaceful protesters on 9 May and the infringement of fundamental rights of Wasantha Mudalige, Hashan Jeewantha and  Venerable Galwewa Siridhamma who have now been detained under 90-day Detention Orders under the PTA. Further, they requested the HRCSL to take necessary measures to recommend that the relevant authorities prosecute those who infringed the fundamental rights of peaceful protesters on 9 May or to refer such matter to a Court of Competent Jurisdiction for due prosecution.  In respect of the three persons now subject to Detention Orders, the People’s Assembly requested to make recommendations to relevant stakeholders, including the President and the IGP, to refrain from using the PTA in such manner and to immediately rescind the Detention Orders that have been issued.

He said on days when the fuel bowser arrives at the fuel station, they are required to deposit Rs 6 million before 9:30 a.m. with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). He claimed that due to the longstanding practice and the dire financial conditions, the dealers are having issues paying for the fuel stock with cash. The CPC is now requesting cash in hand when ordering fuel stocks, he said, and even banks, both State-owned and others, have stopped issuing cheques. He said occasionally the CPC fails to send a bowser on the day when a dealer is able to secure funding and orders a fuel stock. “This is annoying. After much difficulty, we make a deposit, but even after that, the CPC fails to provide us the stocks on that day. The dealers and owners of the fuel stations have given up on this process, and as a result, they have closed the fuel station and are now short on cash and fuel. It all started when Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited’s distribution manager failed. He is the one handling our orders, and it appears that he has other affairs to look after,” Naotunna alleged. Naotunna urged the Government to look into their problems, even though the QR code system is in operation, otherwise, fuel lines could be longer than they have ever been. By Thameenah Razeek"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He noted that there is a problematic situation that has arisen regarding the increase in the price of eggs, due to a huge shortage of animal feed while saying that the shortage of animal feed has arisen due to the increase in the prices of maize and soya beans, which are used to produce animal feed.

The petitioner further charged that Nishantha has committed contempt of the Court through the aforementioned act, adding that it is a punishable offence in accordance with Article 105 (3) of the Constitution. Accordingly, the petitioner requested the Court to issue an order to summon before the Court the original video clips of the concerned press conference which were aired by several private television channels. Furthermore, the petition also requested the Court to issue an interim order for Nishantha to refrain from making any statements that may be in contempt, in the future.

How can we accept these statistics? The recent UNICEF report on child malnutrition in Sri Lanka revealed grim details as to how many pregnant mothers and children are in danger. Therefore, we cannot agree with the President limiting underprivileged people to 61,000 families.

Earlier, a traveller could stay for only 30 days (single entry) with multiple entry period issued only for one year. This follows the removal of travel advisories on Sri Lanka by Norway, Denmark, Sweden, UK, Switzerland, France, issued owing to the protests, political and financial instability in the country. The tour operators have quoted that after the relaxing of the travel advisories they are now expecting more tourists from these countries to come during the winter season. The tourism sector is struggling to revive due to the current economic crisis and even the air ticket purchasing rate is comparatively higher than purchasing the same ticket overseas. Currently, locals are purchasing their air tickets overseas using their kith and kin and friends at half the price. According to Sri Lanka Tourism, between January and August 2022, 494,051 tourists have visited Sri Lanka and they hope an increase of at least 700,000 by end of this year.

The ban on GTF was first lifted in 2015 and they were again banned in 2021 before it was lifted a few weeks ago by the Ministry of Defence on the order of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Speaking to a local Tamil YouTube news network, GTF Spokesperson Suren Surendiran claimed that the ban on their organisation had no effect on the international community because the Sri Lankan Government never adhered to the procedures for banning an organisation according to UN Charter 1373, which include providing convincing evidence and reports to explain why the specific organisation should be banned and giving that organisation a chance to respond. “The global community did not pay attention to the proscription issued by the Sri Lankan Government because none of these were followed,” Surendiran added. Surendiran said that last year, despite the ban, the GTF tried to send USD 3 million worth of respiratory machines to the people in the South, but the Health Ministry rejected it through an official mail saying that the GTF is a banned organisation and to send the aid elsewhere. “It was then Minister MP Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle who apologised and requested the machines to be sent, but it was too late. The company that took the order cancelled and it was sent elsewhere,” Surendiran noted. The GTF was one of the six organisations that were unbanned recently by the President in a bid to bring investment as financial meltdown has crippled the country’s economy. “Despite the ban on GTF, we were interacting with the international community and many leading politicians across the globe, were in touch with regarding Tamil’s issues in Sri Lanka. The ban did not impact on our progress of seeking a solution for the Tamil problem.” He said if the respiratory machines had arrived, at least half of those who died could have been saved. “The entire issue is politically gripped when no diaspora organisations are against the Sinhalese and that is why the Tamil Diaspora tried to support the southern people to win their trust mainly because there is misconstrued information that the Tamils are against the Sinhalese, a narrative brought by Sinhala politicians.” In 2016 the GTF joined hands with many international experts to send 25 medical professionals during the major floods in the South with financial assistance from two countries. Then again they imposed the ban, he added. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

He also claimed that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s economic philosophy is not aimed at a specific group, but rather on uplifting the entire nation. Abeywardena made these claims while speaking to the media in Colombo about the country’s current economic crises and the recommendations President Wickremesinghe has made to resolve them. He said that the country has been dragged down the precipice due to the previous government’s poor economic policies, severely affecting the people of this country. “Dissatisfied with those policies, the public began to protest the Government”. Abeywardena went on to say that the Consumer Affairs Authority is unable to bring commodity prices, including essential commodities, down at this critical juncture. If commodity prices are to return to normal levels, the economy must be rebalanced. The skyrocketing exchange rate of USD must be brought down gradually in order to rebalance the economy. It means local currency value against the US dollar must be increased gradually. At least USD 6 billion will be required to bring the country back to normal. Discussions are currently underway with relevant people as well as entities. We have chosen Japan to restructure our loan.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka Mizukoshi Hideaki handed over the donation to Trade, Commerce and Food Security Minister Nalin Fernando, Minister in the presence of WFP Representative and Country Director Abdur Rahim Siddiqui during a ceremony held at the Ministry in Colombo.   The first tranche forms part of the donation comprising rice, lentils and oil, and valued at USD 1.5 million, which will be distributed by WFP to  15,000 people in both urban and rural areas as well as to 380,000 schoolchildren.   Hideaki speaking at this occasion said, “It is our great honour that we are able to handover the first tranche of essential food supplies today with the rapid procurement of WFP which will be delivered to vulnerable families and children countrywide who are facing extreme hardship, amidst prevailing food shortages and soaring food prices during this unprecedented economic crisis. We hope that this humanitarian assistance will provide relief to all the people in need and help them meet their daily nutritional requirement.”   “I thank the people of Japan for this timely contribution. The Japanese Government was one of the first to pledge support to WFP’s appeal. The donation will go a long way in addressing Sri Lanka’s growing food insecurity while shortages of food and other essentials and skyrocketing prices continue to impact millions of people’s ability to maintain an adequate and nutritious diet,” said WFP’s Siddiqui.    A recent survey by WFP and FAO indicates that many of the households – over 60 per cent – are resorting to coping mechanisms, such as reducing portion sizes and eating less nutritious food which could aggravate the already-high malnutrition rates among women and children, the Embassy said.   In response, WFP is mobilising funds and support to provide emergency assistance to 3.4 million people, including 1.4 million people who are in dire need of emergency food assistance, through food, cash or voucher assistance as well one million schoolchildren and one million pregnant and breastfeeding women by supporting the existing national social safety net programmes.

The donation is part of a larger one of 3,000 metric tons of food. Ambassador Chung said the donation of food items will nourish schoolchildren most at risk of hunger. The donation is part of larger US efforts to help all Sri Lankans emerge from the worst economic crisis since independence.

As a result, only about 250 bowsers are now used to distribute fuel to filling stations across the island. Secretary of the Ceylon Petroleum Private Tanker Owners’ Association Shantha Silva said the owners have withdrawn duties because the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has not increased the drivers’ monthly allowance. He noted that while fuel prices increased, there was no increase in allowances, however, the CPC has informed them that their allowances will be increased. He said the corporation normally pays Rs 400 per kilometre and that they have promised to increase the allowance to Rs 550. He claims that now that the National Fuel Pass system is in place, the reduction in bowsers is insignificant. “Normally, about 800 bowsers are involved in fuel distribution, but that has now been reduced to 250 to 300,” he said. Silva added that there is a problem with fuel distribution. He claimed that over the past few days, the Muthurajawela terminal has only distributed diesel when it should have distributed both petrol and diesel. However, he claims that the queues have resurfaced due to a lack of management in fuel distribution. BY Thameenah Razeek"

The ban on GTF was first lifted in 2015 and they were again banned in 2021 before it was lifted a few weeks ago by the Ministry of Defence on the order of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Speaking to a local Tamil YouTube news network, GTF Spokesperson Suren Surendiran claimed that the ban on their organisation had no effect on the international community because the Sri Lankan Government never adhered to the procedures for banning an organisation according to UN Charter 1373, which include providing convincing evidence and reports to explain why the specific organisation should be banned and giving that organisation a chance to respond. “The global community did not pay attention to the proscription issued by the Sri Lankan Government because none of these were followed,” Surendiran added. Surendiran said that last year, despite the ban, the GTF tried to send USD 3 million worth of respiratory machines to the people in the South, but the Health Ministry rejected it through an official mail saying that the GTF is a banned organisation and to send the aid elsewhere. “It was then Minister MP Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle who apologised and requested the machines to be sent, but it was too late. The company that took the order cancelled and it was sent elsewhere,” Surendiran noted. The GTF was one of the six organisations that were unbanned recently by the President in a bid to bring investment as financial meltdown has crippled the country’s economy. “Despite the ban on GTF, we were interacting with the international community and many leading politicians across the globe, were in touch with regarding Tamil’s issues in Sri Lanka. The ban did not impact on our progress of seeking a solution for the Tamil problem.” He said if the respiratory machines had arrived, at least half of those who died could have been saved. “The entire issue is politically gripped when no diaspora organisations are against the Sinhalese and that is why the Tamil Diaspora tried to support the southern people to win their trust mainly because there is misconstrued information that the Tamils are against the Sinhalese, a narrative brought by Sinhala politicians.” In 2016 the GTF joined hands with many international experts to send 25 medical professionals during the major floods in the South with financial assistance from two countries. Then again they imposed the ban, he added. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The Minister stated this at a press conference held yesterday at his Ministry. He said that currently the SriLankan Catering is making profits to a certain extent and therefore they have decided to sell a 49 per cent stake of the administration of SriLankan Catering, while keeping 51 per cent stake with the Government. He said if an investor is seeking a higher stake in the company, based on the relevant requests by the investors, the Government is prepared to sell a higher percentage of the shares and obtain some funding from that. “When we get that amount of money, we can use it to somewhat reduce the debt burden of SriLankan Airlines,” he said. The Minister also said that currently they are forming a separate company for ground handling and it will be provided with the relevant duties and movable and immovable properties related to that company. “From there we get an income of about Rs 5,000 million per year. Therefore, we think that we will be able to get a lot of money in restructuring it,” de Silva said. He said that they expect to be able to sell 49 per cent stake in that company as well and that no investor will be willing to invest in only 49 per cent shares and therefore, they will have to give them management of the company as well.  Accordingly, he said the Government intends to call for Expressions of Interest (EOIs) for this. The moneys received from both these, we don’t expect to use for any other work. It will be used to pay the debt of SriLankan Airlines and get rid of the debt as much as possible.” During the briefing, the Minister also revealed that the total debt of SriLankan Airlines is USD 1.126 billion which is equivalent to aboutRs 401 billion.

The current Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had held talks with the Qingdao Seawin local agent twice, but they have not arrived at a compromise on the initial endorsement of Sri Lanka agreeing to buy their organic fertiliser and denounced that there is ervinia in their organic fertiliser. Senior Professor – Weed Science Prof. Buddhi Marambe speaking on the current dispute involving organic fertliser said that  the Sri Lankan Government ordered the bulk of organic fertiliser and permitted them to sail. “Why was the cargo shipped without an import permit granted by the Director General of the Department of Agriculture?, he questioned. He said Sri Lanka has instead contributed to the Chinese economy.   The Ministry of Agriculture banned the first shipment of the fertiliser in November 2021 following the National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS), the sole body that has the authority to check the samples and give clearance for shipping, found that the samples were highly contaminated with Erwinia, a matter that cannot be found in imported organic fertiliser based on the country law. “The detection method and conclusion of NPQ in Sri Lanka do not comply with international animal and plant quarantine convention,” the Chinese said and the NPQS stood their grounds that it was contaminated and did not want to revert their decision. Over this matter the Chinese Government blacklisted the State-run People’s Bank last year as the case was pending. China rejected that claim and said Sri Lanka did the wrong reading and later on there was a standoff between the two countries as the ship carrying the fertiliser reached the shores of Sri Lanka.

With that experience in hand you need to intervene on a large scale,” the Prime Minister said. A discussion between Premier Gunawardena and the Sanasa Movement was held at the Prime Minister’s Office in Colombo recently. MPs Suren Raghavan, Yadamini Gunawardena and Anupa Pascual, Prime Minister’s Secretary Anura Dissanayake, Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration Priyantha Mayadunne, Sanasa President Dr. Kirivandeniya, Professor Hilary Silva and several other Sanasa officials participated in the discussion. Dr. Kirivandeniya explained that Sanasa has branches all over the country. “We have 26 societies in Mullaitivu. We advised them to cultivate Dollars. Then the people asked how to do it. We advised them to cultivate grains such as Undu and green gram which are imported from foreign countries. By that we could reduce imports and release the local harvest to the market. For that we have given one 10 million Rupees to the 26 societies and within a season and they have paid back all the money with interest. This time we have given Rs 20 Million. The first thing to do is to fix the mindset of the people. We suggest that people should be given the opportunity to develop the village. There are matured people in elders’ organisations, but they are not given any work worthwhile. Those who implement new programmes in the village are not being admired and appreciated”. The Premier added “I request that development councils be established again. We need to create methods of selling and safeguarding products. The Government should be strengthened. Non-Governmental Organisations are being blamed, but they are performing extremely well at village level. Cooperatives are a subject of local governments. In order to strengthen cooperatives, we need to understand these issues. We need to change from what we eat and from what we wear. In that, education has an important role to play. As soon as a graduate leaves the university, they are sent to the private sector for management training. Even Degree holders do not get the due recognition. Why can’t that training be done in the university itself? We work with millions of farmers. We want to work amicably with farmers. The disease should be properly diagnosed and treated. A long-term programme should be planned. While cultivation is aimed at the garden and the field, we identify separate villages and create producers targeting the market. So far, 200 villages have been selected for that and market representatives have been introduced to those villages to buy the products. The Government should provide them some relief as more expenses will be incurred in exporting”."

As Minister of Power and Energy, I will fully support the formation of such a committee and request that the Opposition chair it,” he said.

A good 500 workforce instead of the 4,200 could do the job efficiently at CPC- CPSTL & half of the 26,000 workforce at CEB. Trade Unions thrive on inefficient members,” he tweeted. The tweet further said all State-owned Enterprises need restructuring. “Political decisions, political appointments, misadministration and incompetence has led to the downfall. I don’t think a majority of the public workforce will survive in the private sector or be recruited at all. Performance based salaries is a must,” he said. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Power and Energy, the CEB restructure will be completed by establishing three profit centres for Generation, Supply, and Distribution. He said the CPC will be restructured and three to four investors, who can import fuel, will be invited. He also stressed that 500 fuel filling stations owned by the CPC would be given to those investors so efficiency could be improved. CPC owns more than 1,200 fuel filling stations. Meanwhile, in another tweet Wijesekara said 24 companies from United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, United States of America, China, India, Russia, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Norway and Philippines have submitted proposals for the EOIs to engage in the Petroleum Business in Sri Lanka.

According to fuel station owners, this is due to fuel stations in Matale District not receiving diesel on time. Farmers’ organisations, who said such a situation would not occur if fuel was provided under proper management, emphasised that the Government should work to provide sufficient fuel quantities, especially during the harvest season. They also pointed out that it is the Government’s responsibility to prepare the necessary supplies for farmers, who provide staple food to the country, otherwise they will have to weep while looking at their destroyed crops.

The tweets said, Chinese Ambassador’s view of Sri Lanka’s northern neighbour may be coloured by how his own country behaves. “India, we assure him, is very different. His imputing a geopolitical context to the visit of a purported scientific research vessel is a giveaway. Opaqueness and debt driven agendas are now a major challenge, especially for smaller nations. Recent developments are a caution. Sri Lanka needs support, not unwanted pressure or unnecessary controversies to serve another country’s agenda,” he tweeted."

He said the water tariff was raised without notice a month ago in response to the increase in the electricity tariff, and that ordinary people are now unable to take a shower. He also queried how a price increase could be implemented without addressing the drawbacks of the services. “It is a miracle that people are surviving in the face of all these price increases,” he said. A special gazette notification was issued by Water Supply Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, increasing the water tariffs with effect from 1 September 2022.

Bakery owners and wheat flour sales agents claim that the shortage of wheat flour is the result of two major wheat flour companies failing to meet the demand of wheat flour sales agents islandwide. The plantation community in Nuwara Eliya consumes wheat flour-based food twice a day, and due to a shortage of wheat flour, those people are also in dire straits. The tea plantation companies purchase the wheat flour required for the plantations on a monthly basis from the wheat flour sales agent and then charge the plantation workers for the wheat flour. Nuwara Eliya District bakery owners claim that wheat flour sales agents only issue a very small quantity of wheat flour required for their bakeries on a daily basis, which is insufficient for daily bakery products. Restaurant owners also claim that due to the present flour shortage, many of the food items produced with wheat flour in their restaurants are not produced, hampering their business activities. Concerning the market shortage of wheat flour, a senior officer of a wheat flour company in Sri Lanka said they have taken the necessary steps to release approximately 25 per cent of the wheat flour presently in his reserve to bakery owners only. Due to the country’s dollar crisis, there is a severe shortage of wheat flour in the market as the company is unable to import wheat flour. By Neeta Pathma Kumari – Norwood"

This plant was previously out of order for 12 days beginning 15 August to Friday (26), thereby burdening the taxpayer with an additional cost of at least Rs 1.85 billion during those 12 days due to the CEB having to burn the expensive diesel and also to procure the same from independent power producers (IPPs)/private sector (PS) to provide electricity to the masses. Due to the 15 August breakdown, the consumer already burdened by record daily power cuts, saw those power cuts being increased from one hour to three hours beginning from 16 August, because the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL)/CEB is broke to import diesel and also to pay IPPs so as to provide uninterrupted power to the country. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), last year, the most expensive form of electricity was ‘CEB Diesel’ which cost the CEB Rs 32.03 a unit (one kilo Watt hour (kWh)), the next most expensive was ‘IPPs Diesel’ (Rs 30.35 a unit), while the cheapest was ‘CEB Hydroelectricity'(Rs 1.67 a unit). Meanwhile, the cost of other forms of electricity, which all belong to the renewable energy (RE) category like ‘CEB Hydroelectricity’, but excluding it and however including mini hydroelectricity, biomass electricity and wind electricity (both PS and and CEB), cost the CEB Rs 16.22 a unit, last year, according to latest CBSL data. If, however, Norochcholai was fully operation with all three 300 MW machines (3X 300 mW) providing electricity, it would be able to meet 45 per cent of Sri Lanka’s total electricity needs. Currently one 300 MW plant is out of order, having been out of order since at least 27 June.  Meanwhile, on Saturday RE in total met 69.92 per cent (24.06 GWh) of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs, coal (29.7 per cent/10.22 GWh)) and diesel (0.38 per cent/0.13 GWh), respectively. On Saturday, Sri Lanka consumed a total of 34.41 GWh of electricity.

Speaking to The Hindu days after the Chinese satellite and missile tracking ship, the Yuan Wang 5 had departed from the Sri Lankan port after “refuelling and replenishing supplies,” High Commissioner Milinda Moragoda said that Colombo had kept the Modi government briefed at the “highest levels” through the controversy. In a possible sign of the strain in ties over the issue, the Ministry of External Affairs had issued a rare “travel guidance” on Thursday cautioning Indian tourists about visiting Sri Lanka, which is in the middle of a deep economic crisis. Without commenting on the MEA advisory, Moragoda said it was important to look to the future of ties, particularly in terms of India-Sri Lanka cooperation in the economic and strategic sphere. Apart from economic assistance of $3.8 billion, including credit lines from India, New Delhi and Colombo are discussing more trade ties, a power-sharing grid, and infrastructure projects in renewable energy and oil storage. India has also supported Sri Lanka in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout. “There is no question that the docking of the ship was an issue between us. The question is how to build a framework for such problems in order to avoid them in the future, and not to allow this kind of issue to lead to a trust deficit,” Moragoda said, adding that despite “ups and downs”, Sri Lanka would like to “build an equilibrium in the relationship, where there are no surprises”. In an unusually public move, the Modi government had last month conveyed its concerns over the docking of the ship, believed to be a satellite research and surveillance vessel. While the Sri Lankan government had asked China to defer the ship’s plans entirely after India’s objections, the Chinese government had only agreed to delay its arrival in Hambantota by a few days, and eventually the Yuan Wang 5 docked at the port from 16 – 22 August. According to Moragoda, the permissions for the docking had been granted to China amidst a period of political turmoil in Colombo, when President Ranil Wickremesinghe took charge after the ouster of previous President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, as well as the economic crisis, leading to “not enough attention” being given to the case. According to official data, the visit of the ship had also followed after at least 10 research vessels of a different class had docked in Colombo between 2019-2022, without raising any concerns in Delhi.  “In this particular case, there could have been a level of confusion in Colombo when it came to differentiating between the classes of vessels and technologies involved. Unfortunately, once the approvals were given, it was hard to take them back,” Mr. Moragoda said, adding that Sri Lanka was hoping to focus on strengthening lines of communication, as well as high-level exchanges, and people-to-people ties. According to sources, both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Wickremesinghe are expected to travel to Tokyo to attend former Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s state funeral. On a visit to Gujarat last week, Sri Lankan Tourism Minister Harin Fernando had also pitched for more Indian tourists, saying that he hoped that at least 10 lakh international tourists, mostly Indians, would visit this year. However, striking a cautionary note on Thursday, the MEA’s spokesperson said encouraged Indians to exercise all care and caution while in Sri Lanka, and “examine all relevant factors, including currency convertibility and the fuel situation before undertaking any essential travel to Sri Lanka”."

With the skyrocketing price of kerosene, everyone depending on it has been severely affected,” Thondaman said.

The tweets said, Chinese Ambassador’s view of Sri Lanka’s northern neighbour may be coloured by how his own country behaves. “India, we assure him, is very different. His imputing a geopolitical context to the visit of a purported scientific research vessel is a giveaway. Opaqueness and debt driven agendas are now a major challenge, especially for smaller nations. Recent developments are a caution. Sri Lanka needs support, not unwanted pressure or unnecessary controversies to serve another country’s agenda,” he tweeted."

Whilst criticism was levelled against the cutting down of the tree, whilst the leopard was on it, the committee observed that cutting the tree was the only option that was available to the officers  under minimum facilities. The report contained 25 recommendations regarding the protection of the mountain leopard population, while noting that attention should also be paid to the establishment of wildlife protection committees at the village level to save the animals and get prompt information. Commenting on the difficulties faced in rescuing the said mountain leopard due to the shortage of equipment, the committee emphasised on the importance of providing equipment, machines necessary for rescuing endangered animals, especially portable equipment for use in mountainous areas. A Mountain leopard got caught in a snare that was set up to hunt wild boar on 6 August, following which it climbed a tree with a wire of the snare wrapped around it. Despite the efforts of the wildlife officers to cut the tree to rescue the leopard, it succumbed to its injuries. Amaraweera instructed that a committee be appointed to investigate the incident while stating that disciplinary actions would be taken against wildlife officers if the investigations reveal any negligence on their part. Investigations revealed that the leopard had died due to the damage sustained in its internal organs as a result of being caught in the snare and hanging from a tall tree for hours.

The WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency in July. So far, more than 41,000 cases of monkeypox and 12 deaths have been reported from 96 countries, with the majority of cases from the United States. The decrease in case numbers may potentially signal that the outbreak is declining in the European region, according to WHO’s latest epidemiological report. “There are signs the outbreak is slowing in Europe, where a combination of effective public health measures, behaviour change and vaccination is helping to prevent transmission,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press briefing. Still, nearly two dozen countries saw a rise in weekly case numbers with the highest increase reported in the United States. Over 34% of the current global case count is in the U.S. The regions of the Americas is continuing to see intense transmission and the region accounted for 60% of cases in the past month. “In Latin America in particular, insufficient awareness or public health measures are combining with a lack of access to vaccines to fan the flames of the outbreak,” Tedros said. With vaccines in short supply, many countries including the U.S. are trying to stretch out supplies by administering smaller doses to make the most of existing stocks. While regulators have justified the approach, Bavarian Nordic, the maker of the only approved monkeypox vaccine, has raised doubts about the safety of this so-called fractional dosing approach. WHO is looking closely at the performance of available vaccines including use of fractional doses, a senior official said, adding that the “agency’s strategic advisory group of experts will be meeting at the beginning of October to evaluate the evidence including fractional dose issues.” (Reuters)"

Conversions are based on the administered value of the benchmark ‘spot’ as at Friday which was Rs 361 to the US dollar. Government of Sri Lanka’s (GoSL’s) face value money printing  (FVMP) debt decreased by 0.23 per cent (Rs 7,380 million) to Rs 3,157,862.36 million (Rs 3.1579 trillion) on Tuesday, thereby marginally defraying demand-pull inflationary pressure as well. Meanwhile, the fall in GoSL’s at least theoretical MP borrowing costs (BCs), relative to the decline in GoSL’s face value money printing (FVMP) debt, accelerated by 0.68 per cent (Rs  871.41million) to Rs 126,637.58 million  on Tuesday led by buying pressure of Treasury (T) Bills and T Bonds in secondary market trading due to expectations of higher yields for the second consecutive market day. Latest Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data showed that while Banks’ average weighted prime lending rate (AWPLR) on Friday was 25.68 per cent,  whereas last week’s benchmark 364-day (one year) T Bill fetched a higher  weighted average yield of  29.14 per cent, 346 basis points more than Friday’s AWPLR.  GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs three trillion for a record consecutive 33 market days to Tuesday.  Also, GoSL’s highest to the 238th highest FVMP debt has been registered for a record 238 market days to Tuesday. Market was short for a record 235 market days to Tuesday,  though this shortfall decreased by 1.61 per cent (Rs 10,459 million) to Rs 638,114 million, nonetheless causing  sustained rate pressure.  Transactions between the CBSL and the GoSL are foreign reserves neutral and CBSL which administers daily open market operations; lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL.  GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot’. The ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and lower the cost of ‘essential’ imports, while ‘essential’ imports are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee as Sri Lanka is an import dependent economy.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency in July. So far, more than 41,000 cases of monkeypox and 12 deaths have been reported from 96 countries, with the majority of cases from the United States. The decrease in case numbers may potentially signal that the outbreak is declining in the European region, according to WHO’s latest epidemiological report. “There are signs the outbreak is slowing in Europe, where a combination of effective public health measures, behaviour change and vaccination is helping to prevent transmission,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press briefing. Still, nearly two dozen countries saw a rise in weekly case numbers with the highest increase reported in the United States. Over 34% of the current global case count is in the U.S. The regions of the Americas is continuing to see intense transmission and the region accounted for 60% of cases in the past month. “In Latin America in particular, insufficient awareness or public health measures are combining with a lack of access to vaccines to fan the flames of the outbreak,” Tedros said. With vaccines in short supply, many countries including the U.S. are trying to stretch out supplies by administering smaller doses to make the most of existing stocks. While regulators have justified the approach, Bavarian Nordic, the maker of the only approved monkeypox vaccine, has raised doubts about the safety of this so-called fractional dosing approach. WHO is looking closely at the performance of available vaccines including use of fractional doses, a senior official said, adding that the “agency’s strategic advisory group of experts will be meeting at the beginning of October to evaluate the evidence including fractional dose issues.” (Reuters)"

Pakistan has urged the international community to help with relief efforts as it struggles to cope with the aftermath of torrential rains that have triggered massive floods since last month, killing more than 900 people.  “33 million have been affected, in different ways; the final homeless figure is being assessed,” Climate Change Minister Sherry Rehman told Reuters in a text message. She added that the southern province of Sindh, hardest hit in the last few days, had requested one million tents for affected people. “South of Pakistan is inundated almost underwater…people are going to higher ground,” she said. “Needs assessment is being done, we have to make U.N.’s international flash appeal; this is not the task of one country or one province, it is a climate-induced disaster,” she added. Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal separately told Reuters that 30 million people had been affected, a figure that would represent about 15% of the South Asian country’s population. U.N. agency Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update on Thursday that the monsoon rains had affected some 3 million people in Pakistan of which 184,000 have been displaced to relief camps across the country. Funding and reconstruction efforts will be a challenge for cash-strapped Pakistan, which is having to cut spending to ensure the International Monetary Fund approves the release of much-needed bailout money. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said in a report that, in the last 24 hours, 150 kilometres of roads had been damaged across the country, and over 82,000 homes have been partially or fully damaged. Since mid-June, when the monsoon began, over 3,000 kilometres of road, 130 bridges and 495,000 homes have been damaged, according to NDMA’s last situation report, figures also echoed in the OHCA report.

Russia has not said how many casualties it has suffered in Ukraine since the first weeks of the campaign, when it said 1,351 of its soldiers had been killed.

Some of requests are even received through well-known businessmen, politicians and other highly respected people in the society’’, officials revealed. According to them, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the CBSL is conducting investigations to verify the legitimacy of those funding requests. According to FIU observations, there were serious doubts about the main funding sources of most of these requests. Some parties even have serious money laundering links and some were fake requests Officials also said that the amount of money promised to be brought to the country by some parties was more than the value of the entire Gross Domestic Product of Sri Lanka. “We have told certain parties that if they really wants to help the country via legitimate fund transfer process, first invest a several millions of dollars in government securities market and show their patriotism. But those people are not willing to accept our request. Instead, they said that the relevant funds can be used for the infrastructure development,” officials asserted. It is also stated that there have been requests to bring these funds to Sri Lanka through various methods apart from the Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS) currently in operation in Sri Lanka. However, considering the dubiousness of all those requests, all requests were rejected, officials said. CBSL is empowered by the Payment and Settlement Systems (PSS) Act to regulate and supervise payment, clearing and settlement systems, prescribing policies and setting standards to regulate and supervise all payment and settlement systems in the country. Therefore, they have to be compliant with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) rules and regulations. FATF is the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog.

This was revealed by the report prepared by the special committee appointed by the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA). GMOA Secretary, Dr. Haritha Aluthge said this signifies a dangerous situation for the future. It is confirmed that some medicine stocks will not be enough even for the next two weeks, he lamented. The report having been made following the review of the pharmaceutical situation in all State hospitals was submitted to the GMOA on Tuesday (23) and had been discussed within the union’s Executive Committee and its Central Committee. What is most concerning is that some of these essential medicines were in short supply even in the private sector.    Quoting the report further, he noted that according to the probe conducted, it appeared that medicinal drug prices compared to those three months earlier of all medicines had shot up by 100 to 300 per cent. It resulted in patients affected by these shortages suffering even more due to the shortages even in the private sector.  Dr. Aluthge said the Committee had submitted several proposals to overcome the shortage which includes a formal mechanism to be established in the Health Ministry to ensure proper coordination between its officials who are directly involved in the drug supply process, the Central Drug Stores, the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation, and the National Medicines Regulatory Authority. This high-level coordination committee should convene under the Chairmanship of the Health Secretary. “There should be transparency in the tender procedure, so that any citizen of this country can monitor activities. Also, the database on drug stocks should be upgraded.” The GMOA Secretary said, a fully empowered committee should be appointed to study the audit reports of the last five years related to the drug supplying process and implement them within a specified time frame. He said other stakeholders should contribute towards this process. “The Presidential Commission Report should be reviewed and prompt action should be taken to punish those named as respondents under the Penal Code and the Bribery Commission Act. Also, those holding positions should be removed immediately from their positions if they are found guilty.” Dr. Aluthge said, the report would be submitted to the Health Minister and his officials in the next few days.   By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Meanwhile, in 32 (42.11 per cent) of the remaining 33 days to  Tuesday, over 50 per cent of the island’s daily electricity needs were met by the pollutive and imported fossil fuels (FFs) comprising coal and diesel and in the other single day (1.32 per cent), splits were evenly (50:50) shared between FFs and RE, respectively Consequently, RE led by ‘CEB Hydro’ provided over 50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity demand for 24 consecutive days to  Tuesday (23 August), with   Tuesday’s ‘CEB Hydro’ percentage figure alone being  equivalent to 77.92 per cent of total RE, CEB statistics further showed.  The last time, where for a period longer than this, where RE was the dominant player in Sri Lanka’s electricity sector for a consecutive number of days, took place 76 days ago, where, for 30 consecutive days from 10 May to 8 June 2022, over 50 per cent of the island’s electricity needs were met by RE, once more led by ‘CEB Hydro’. However in the 235 days that have transpired in the year to  Tuesday, RE was responsible for providing 50 per cent or over of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs in only 74 (31.49 per cent) days and FFs in the balance 161 (68.51 per cent)  days, respectively. In related developments, of the total electricity supplied by the CEB to consumers in Sri Lanka on Tuesday which was  39.36 gigaWatt hours (GWh), FFs share was 11.19 GWh (28.43 per cent)  and RE’s share was 28.17 gWh (71.57 per cent) respectively. Tuesday’s FFs breakdown comprised CEB Coal 6.5 GWh, Private Sector (PS)/independent power producers’ Diesel 2.84 gWh and CEB Diesel 1.85 GWh respectively.   Tuesday’s RE breakdown comprised CEB Hydro 21.95 GWh, followed by PS Wind 2.23 gWh, CEB Wind 1.75 GWh, PS Mini-Hydro 1.66 GWh, PS Solar 0.32 GWh and PS Biomass 0.26 GWh, respectively. ‘CEB’s Hydro’ breakdown of  Tuesday comprised Mahaweli  13.01 gWh, equivalent to 59.27 per cent of total ‘CEB Hydro’, Laxapana 7.15 GWh (32.57 per cent) and Samanalawewa (ie both Samanalawewa and Kukule Ganga hydroelectric power projects (HEPPs) together, 1.78 gwh (8.11 per cent), respectively. ‘Mahaweli Hydro’ comprises Victoria, Randenigala, Rantanbe, Kotmale and Upper Kotmale HEEP projects, respectively. Victoria, Randenigala, Rantanbe and Kotmale HEPPs were built during the J.R. Jayewardene era after obtaining grant and concessional aid from the West. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s 2021 Annual Report, the cheapest source of electricity generation to the CEB last year was ‘CEB Hydro’, costing a mere Rs 1.67 a unit or per one Kilo Watt hour (KWh) of electricity followed by Coal (Rs 10.87); non-conventional RE such as Mini-Hydro, Wind-both CEB and PS, Biomass and Solar (Rs 18.99), ‘CEB Diesel’ (Rs 29.01) and ‘PS Diesel’ (Rs 30.35), respectively However, Sri Lanka’s sole coal electricity generator, the 900 mW Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, built by the Chinese after obtaining a mix of  foreign commercial and concessional loans during the Mahinda Rajapaksa era sans tender call and incurring US$ 1.35 billion of taxpayers’ money to build it, is generally, only partially operative for several days, forcing the Government of Sri Lanka/CEB to be over reliant on the expensive diesel to meet a large size of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs on most days.  But due to a US dollar shortage in the country led by corruption exemplified during Rajapaksa’s near 10- year tenure in office, from 17 November 2005 to 8 January 2015, Sri Lanka has no dollars to import not only the cheap coal to provide power to the country 24 hours a day, but also diesel to operate a regular bus service, resulting in partial Government offices closures during a week, which is a record, whilst aiding and abetting socioeconomic unrest in the country. In Sri Lanka’s 74 year history of independence, never once did expensive Government foreign commercial debt (GFCD) as a percentage of total Government foreign debt (GFD) exceed seven per cent other than during the Rajapaksa era. GFCD, which was a mere four per cent of GFD when Rajapaksa took office in 2005, hit a record 28 per cent in 2009, before reaching a record 51 per cent in 2012 and staying that way since. An example of GFCD is the above malfunctioning coal plant. During this period, IMF’s Resident Representative to Sri Lanka Dr Koshy Mathai (2009-2013), warned the Government of excessive GFCD, but his warning fell on deaf ears. BY Paneetha Ameresekere"

Speaking to the media, Prasanga Fernando, a representative for the Association, said the fisheries communities have been staying at home for more than three months owing to the kerosene shortage.  “We need 50 litres of kerosene daily and lubricants were only Rs 4,800, but now we need Rs 17,000 to buy kerosene. That means we will have to spend Rs 22,000 on kerosene and oil on a daily basis. However, if we do not get a fish harvest on that day, all of these Rs 22, 000 will be wasted,” he lamented. He said the situation as unbearable because the fishermen did not put the country in this crisis situation. BY Thameenah Razeek"

Consequently, the ASPI, yesterday over Tuesday (23) fell by 0.66 per cent to 9.011.24 points and the S&P SL 20 Index by 1.51 per cent to 2,944.50 points on a Rs 2.55 billion turnover.  Yesterday was the first time after six calendar days that the bourse made a turnover of under three billion rupees. Yesterday was also the first time after five calendar days that the ASPI returned a lower figure than 9.011.24 points, while the last time that the S&P SL 20 Index made a lower value than 2,944.50 points was 14 calendar days ago. Also, market capitalisation slipped under the Rs four trillion mark for the first time after six calendar days yesterday, recording a figure of Rs 3.97 trillion yesterday. Nonetheless, as a consolation, the bourse enjoyed net foreign inflows (NFIs), albeit nominal, for seven consecutive market days to  yesterday after 30 calendar days, with yesterday’s value being Rs 68.9 million. However, in the calendar year to yesterday it has suffered a net foreign outflow of Rs 1,026.8 million.  Prior to yesterday, the last time the bourse enjoyed NFIs for at least seven consecutive market days was from 14 July to 25 July, where, for eight consecutive market days in the review period, it enjoyed NFIs. Yesterday saw a total of 115.99 million shares changing hands. ‘Spot’ Unchanged for 37th Day The benchmark, albeit administered market ‘spot’ closed unchanged for the thirty seventh consecutive market day at Rs 360/364 to the US dollar in two way quotes to yesterday (Wednesday 24 August), market sources told ‘Ceylon Today’. In related developments, during this period last year, where then too the administered, made worse by an inflexible market ‘spot’ in operation, that closed unchanged for the thirty second consecutive market day to 24 August 2021 at Rs 202/203 to the dollar in two way quotes. Yesterday, the administered market “spot” was down by between 78.22-79.31 per cent (Rs 158-161), year on year (YoY); thereby causing cost push inflationary pressure as Sri Lanka is an import dependent economy, they said. The band in which the ‘guided market spot’ may currently operate is fixed at +/- three per cent of the officially administered ‘spot’ value, where the latter is applicable for transactions involving the GoSL, CBSL and or between the GoSL and/or CBSL with the market, which was fixed at Rs 361 to the dollar yesterday. They further said that trades in the administered market ‘spot’ (Rs 360/364) yesterday were mainly restricted to ‘bank-client’ outright trades, while the interbank foreign exchange (FX) market was however dominated by swaps, which were outside the domain of the FX market for this purpose. In like developments, the administered ‘spot’ for official purposes, such as for trades involving CBSL, GoSL and/or CBSL, GoSL and the market, YoY to  yesterday had depreciated by  80.59 per cent (Rs 161.10). Yesterday, the value of this official administered ‘spot’ was fixed at Rs 361 to the dollar, while a year ago it was fixed at Rs 199.90. Meanwhile,  the straitjacketed, inflexible administered market ‘spot’ a year ago was fixed at Rs 202/203 to the dollar in two way quotes, unchanged for the thirty second consecutive market day to  24 August 2021.  ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction.

She said the 225 MPs must extend their cooperation to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, putting personal disagreements and contradictions aside to save the country and restore normalcy to the crisis-affected. Senanayake said the CMC has taken steps to provide relief with the support and contribution of leading supermarkets including Sathosa. The CMC has distributed Sathosa cash vouchers worth Rs 3,500 to 3,000 to low-income families within the CMC limits. She said plans were afoot to launch various welfare programmes within the CMC limits in the near future to fulfil the hunger pangs of the poor in Colombo. “It is not the time for personal or political mileage. If we do so at this critical juncture, we wouldn’t be good politicians. It is also not the time to take revenge from others.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/08/25/ways-rise-sharply-for-2nd-straight-week/,WAYs rise sharply for 2nd straight week,Author not found,0,2022-08-24T20:30:00+00:00," Weighted average yields (WAYs) across all three tenures at yesterday’s weekly Treasury (T) Bill auction rose  sharply for the second consecutive market week due to rising record high inflation of 66.7 per cent registered last month. High inflation gives a thrust for rates also to increase to combat money circulation. Consequently, the WAYs of the 91, 182 and the benchmark 364 day maturities rose by 107, 55 and 69 basis points (bps) each week on week (WoW) to 30.51 per cent, 29.51 per cent and 29.14 per cent and 29.83 per cent, respectively. Due to a mix of Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) controls and yield pressure on the shorter tenure 91 day maturity, the WAY of the 91-day maturity was higher than the WAY of both the 182 and 364-day maturities, which is also a market distortion, a phenomenon witnessed at yesterday’s auction. In order to further bridle yield pressure, CBSL sold only 63.01 per cent (Rs 56,713 million) compared to the original offer of Rs 90,000 million made at yesterday’s auction. In the connection, the sales splits comprised 88.18 per cent (Rs 38,801 million), 41.66 per cent (Rs 9,582 million) and 36.22 per cent (Rs 8,330 million) compared to the original offers of Rs 44,000 million made for the 91 day maturities and Rs 23,000 million each for the 182 and 364-day maturities offered at yesterday’s auction.  Meanwhile, CBSL, on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) will have to repay a total of Rs 66,561 million worth of maturing T Bills to the market by tomorrow (Friday,26 August). Of this value, CBSL has divulged the tenures of Rs 60,561 million worth maturing T Bills only. In respect of the balance Rs 6,000 million worth of maturities repayable to the market, CBSL, however, hasn’t divulged their tenure/s. The splits of the tenures of the Rs 60,561 million maturities are Rs 60,116 million worth of 91 day maturities, Rs 245 million (182 day maturities) and Rs 200 million (364 day maturities), respectively. However, T Bill repayments due to CBSL by tomorrow are unknown as CBSL doesn’t also divulge such figures. Issuing of T Bills and T Bonds is a popular way that GoSL raises money domestically to meet its monetary needs. T Bill auctions are generally held weekly. Investing in T Bills and T Bonds are risk free, because in the event GoSL is unable to honour such debt, CBSL is mandated to print demand pull inflationary money and repay such creditors. Money printing is the sole prerogative of CBSL. CBSL is also the steward of GoSL debt. BY Paneetha Ameresekere"

Meanwhile, the fall in GoSL’s at least theoretical MP borrowing costs (BCs), relative to the decline in GoSL’s face value money printing (FVMP) debt, accelerated by 0.68 per cent (Rs  871.41million) to Rs 126,637.58 million  on Tuesday led by buying pressure of Treasury (T) Bills and T Bonds in secondary market trading due to expectations of higher yields for the second consecutive market day. Latest Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data showed that while Banks’ average weighted prime lending rate (AWPLR) on Friday was 25.68 per cent,  whereas last week’s benchmark 364 day (one year) T Bill fetched a higher  weighted average yield of  29.14 per cent, 346 basis points more than Friday’s AWPLR.  GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs three trillion for a record consecutive 33 market days to Tuesday.  Also, GoSL’s highest to the 238th highest FVMP debt has been registered for a record 238 market days to Tuesday. Market was short for a record 235 market days to Tuesday,  though this shortfall decreased by 1.61 per cent (Rs 10,459 million) to Rs 638,114 million, nonetheless causing  sustained rate pressure.  Transactions between the CBSL and the GoSL are foreign reserves neutral and CBSL which administers daily open market operations; lacks transparency.

The ‘spot’ is administered to minimize GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and lower the cost of ‘essential’ imports, while ‘essential’ imports are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee as Sri Lanka is an import dependent economy.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Meanwhile, in 32 (42.11 per cent) of the remaining 33 days to  Tuesday, over 50 per cent of the island’s daily electricity needs were met by the pollutive and imported fossil fuels (FFs) comprising coal and diesel and in the other single day (1.32 per cent), splits were evenly (50:50) shared between FFs and RE, respectively Consequently, RE led by ‘CEB Hydro’ provided over 50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity demand for 24 consecutive days to  Tuesday (23 August), with   Tuesday’s ‘CEB Hydro’ percentage figure alone being  equivalent to 77.92 per cent of total RE, CEB statistics further showed.  The last time, where for a period longer than this, where RE was the dominant player in Sri Lanka’s electricity sector for a consecutive number of days, took place 76 days ago, where, for 30 consecutive days from 10 May to 8 June 2022, over 50 per cent of the island’s electricity needs were met by RE, once more led by ‘CEB Hydro’. However in the 235 days that have transpired in the year to  Tuesday, RE was responsible for providing 50 per cent or over of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs in only 74 (31.49 per cent) days and FFs in the balance 161 (68.51 per cent)  days, respectively. In related developments, of the total electricity supplied by the CEB to consumers in Sri Lanka on Tuesday which was  39.36 gigaWatt hours (GWh), FFs share was 11.19 GWh (28.43 per cent)  and RE’s share was 28.17 gWh (71.57 per cent) respectively. Tuesday’s FFs breakdown comprised CEB Coal 6.5 GWh, Private Sector (PS)/independent power producers’ Diesel 2.84 gWh and CEB Diesel 1.85 GWh respectively.   Tuesday’s RE breakdown comprised CEB Hydro 21.95 GWh, followed by PS Wind 2.23 gWh, CEB Wind 1.75 GWh, PS Mini-Hydro 1.66 GWh, PS Solar 0.32 GWh and PS Biomass 0.26 GWh, respectively. ‘CEB’s Hydro’ breakdown of  Tuesday comprised Mahaweli  13.01 gWh, equivalent to 59.27 per cent of total ‘CEB Hydro’, Laxapana 7.15 GWh (32.57 per cent) and Samanalawewa (ie both Samanalawewa and Kukule Ganga hydroelectric power projects (HEPPs) together, 1.78 gwh (8.11 per cent), respectively. ‘Mahaweli Hydro’ comprises Victoria, Randenigala, Rantanbe, Kotmale and Upper Kotmale HEEP projects, respectively. Victoria, Randenigala, Rantanbe and Kotmale HEPPs were built during the J.R. Jayewardene era after obtaining grant and concessional aid from the West. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s 2021 Annual Report, the cheapest source of electricity generation to the CEB last year was ‘CEB Hydro’, costing a mere Rs 1.67 a unit or per one Kilo Watt hour (KWh) of electricity followed by Coal (Rs 10.87); non-conventional RE such as Mini-Hydro, Wind-both CEB and PS, Biomass and Solar (Rs 18.99), ‘CEB Diesel’ (Rs 29.01) and ‘PS Diesel’ (Rs 30.35), respectively However, Sri Lanka’s sole coal electricity generator, the 900 mW Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, built by the Chinese after obtaining a mix of  foreign commercial and concessional loans during the Mahinda Rajapaksa era sans tender call and incurring US$ 1.35 billion of taxpayers’ money to build it, is generally, only partially operative for several days, forcing the Government of Sri Lanka/CEB to be over reliant on the expensive diesel to meet a large size of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs on most days.  But due to a US dollar shortage in the country led by corruption exemplified during Rajapaksa’s near 10- year tenure in office, from 17 November 2005 to 8 January 2015, Sri Lanka has no dollars to import not only the cheap coal to provide power to the country 24 hours a day, but also diesel to operate a regular bus service, resulting in partial Government offices closures during a week, which is a record, whilst aiding and abetting socioeconomic unrest in the country. In Sri Lanka’s 74 year history of independence, never once did expensive Government foreign commercial debt (GFCD) as a percentage of total Government foreign debt (GFD) exceed seven per cent other than during the Rajapaksa era. GFCD, which was a mere four per cent of GFD when Rajapaksa took office in 2005, hit a record 28 per cent in 2009, before reaching a record 51 per cent in 2012 and staying that way since. An example of GFCD is the above malfunctioning coal plant. During this period, IMF’s Resident Representative to Sri Lanka Dr Koshy Mathai (2009-2013), warned the Government of excessive GFCD, but his warning fell on deaf ears. BY Paneetha Ameresekere"

Speaking to the media, Prasanga Fernando, a representative for the Association, said the fisheries communities have been staying at home for more than three months owing to the kerosene shortage.  “We need 50 litres of kerosene daily and lubricants were only Rs 4,800, but now we need Rs 17,000 to buy kerosene. That means we will have to spend Rs 22,000 on kerosene and oil on a daily basis. However, if we do not get a fish harvest on that day, all of these Rs 22, 000 will be wasted,” he lamented. He said the situation as unbearable because the fishermen did not put the country in this crisis situation. BY Thameenah Razeek"

Consequently, the ASPI, yesterday over Tuesday (23) fell by 0.66 per cent to 9.011.24 points and the S&P SL 20 Index by 1.51 per cent to 2,944.50 points on a Rs 2.55 billion turnover.  Yesterday was the first time after six calendar days that the bourse made a turnover of under three billion rupees. Yesterday was also the first time after five calendar days that the ASPI returned a lower figure than 9.011.24 points, while the last time that the S&P SL 20 Index made a lower value than 2,944.50 points was 14 calendar days ago. Also, market capitalisation slipped under the Rs four trillion mark for the first time after six calendar days yesterday, recording a figure of Rs 3.97 trillion yesterday. Nonetheless, as a consolation, the bourse enjoyed net foreign inflows (NFIs), albeit nominal, for seven consecutive market days to  yesterday after 30 calendar days, with yesterday’s value being Rs 68.9 million. However, in the calendar year to yesterday it has suffered a net foreign outflow of Rs 1,026.8 million.  Prior to yesterday, the last time the bourse enjoyed NFIs for at least seven consecutive market days was from 14 July to 25 July, where, for eight consecutive market days in the review period, it enjoyed NFIs. Yesterday saw a total of 115.99 million shares changing hands. ‘Spot’ Unchanged for 37th Day The benchmark, albeit administered market ‘spot’ closed unchanged for the thirty seventh consecutive market day at Rs 360/364 to the US dollar in two way quotes to yesterday (Wednesday 24 August), market sources told ‘Ceylon Today’. In related developments, during this period last year, where then too the administered, made worse by an inflexible market ‘spot’ in operation, that closed unchanged for the thirty second consecutive market day to 24 August 2021 at Rs 202/203 to the dollar in two way quotes. Yesterday, the administered market “spot” was down by between 78.22-79.31 per cent (Rs 158-161), year on year (YoY); thereby causing cost push inflationary pressure as Sri Lanka is an import dependent economy, they said. The band in which the ‘guided market spot’ may currently operate is fixed at +/- three per cent of the officially administered ‘spot’ value, where the latter is applicable for transactions involving the GoSL, CBSL and or between the GoSL and/or CBSL with the market, which was fixed at Rs 361 to the dollar yesterday. They further said that trades in the administered market ‘spot’ (Rs 360/364) yesterday were mainly restricted to ‘bank-client’ outright trades, while the interbank foreign exchange (FX) market was however dominated by swaps, which were outside the domain of the FX market for this purpose. In like developments, the administered ‘spot’ for official purposes, such as for trades involving CBSL, GoSL and/or CBSL, GoSL and the market, YoY to  yesterday had depreciated by  80.59 per cent (Rs 161.10). Yesterday, the value of this official administered ‘spot’ was fixed at Rs 361 to the dollar, while a year ago it was fixed at Rs 199.90. Meanwhile,  the straitjacketed, inflexible administered market ‘spot’ a year ago was fixed at Rs 202/203 to the dollar in two way quotes, unchanged for the thirty second consecutive market day to  24 August 2021.  ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction.

She said the 225 MPs must extend their cooperation to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, putting personal disagreements and contradictions aside to save the country and restore normalcy to the crisis-affected. Senanayake said the CMC has taken steps to provide relief with the support and contribution of leading supermarkets including Sathosa.

She said plans were afoot to launch various welfare programmes within the CMC limits in the near future to fulfil the hunger pangs of the poor in Colombo. “It is not the time for personal or political mileage.

High inflation gives a thrust for rates also to increase to combat money circulation. Consequently, the WAYs of the 91, 182 and the benchmark 364 day maturities rose by 107, 55 and 69 basis points (bps) each week on week (WoW) to 30.51 per cent, 29.51 per cent and 29.14 per cent and 29.83 per cent, respectively. Due to a mix of Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) controls and yield pressure on the shorter tenure 91 day maturity, the WAY of the 91-day maturity was higher than the WAY of both the 182 and 364-day maturities, which is also a market distortion, a phenomenon witnessed at yesterday’s auction. In order to further bridle yield pressure, CBSL sold only 63.01 per cent (Rs 56,713 million) compared to the original offer of Rs 90,000 million made at yesterday’s auction. In the connection, the sales splits comprised 88.18 per cent (Rs 38,801 million), 41.66 per cent (Rs 9,582 million) and 36.22 per cent (Rs 8,330 million) compared to the original offers of Rs 44,000 million made for the 91 day maturities and Rs 23,000 million each for the 182 and 364-day maturities offered at yesterday’s auction.  Meanwhile, CBSL, on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) will have to repay a total of Rs 66,561 million worth of maturing T Bills to the market by tomorrow (Friday,26 August). Of this value, CBSL has divulged the tenures of Rs 60,561 million worth maturing T Bills only. In respect of the balance Rs 6,000 million worth of maturities repayable to the market, CBSL, however, hasn’t divulged their tenure/s. The splits of the tenures of the Rs 60,561 million maturities are Rs 60,116 million worth of 91 day maturities, Rs 245 million (182 day maturities) and Rs 200 million (364 day maturities), respectively. However, T Bill repayments due to CBSL by tomorrow are unknown as CBSL doesn’t also divulge such figures. Issuing of T Bills and T Bonds is a popular way that GoSL raises money domestically to meet its monetary needs. T Bill auctions are generally held weekly. Investing in T Bills and T Bonds are risk free, because in the event GoSL is unable to honour such debt, CBSL is mandated to print demand pull inflationary money and repay such creditors. Money printing is the sole prerogative of CBSL. CBSL is also the steward of GoSL debt. BY Paneetha Ameresekere"

One source said his return was partly linked to the cost of his stay in Thailand. Rajapaksa fled Sri Lanka in the early hours of 13 July after massive protests engulfed Colombo and demonstrators angry with the country’s economic devastation stormed his official residence and office. He resigned as President after reaching Singapore, from where he later flew to Thailand. It was reported that Rajapaksa could come back on Wednesday (24), but sources said the arrival had been deferred as talks continue between the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the Government over his security and other concerns. “He definitely wants to come back. But security is the main issue and intelligence has advised that he delay his return,” a Sri Lankan Government official, who is one of the sources said. “He may return in two weeks or even before that if arrangements for his safety can be made,” he added. The second source said the high cost of his stay in Thailand was a factor in seeking a return home as soon as possible. “The bill has now run into several hundred million rupees as it includes the cost of a private jet, a presidential suite and round the clock security,” the source said. “The cost is becoming prohibitive.” The expenses are largely being borne by some of his supporters, according to another source close to the Rajapaksa family. However, all sources discussing the affairs of the former President declined to be named. SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam said the party had met President Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking arrangements for Rajapaksa’s return. “We have made the request for his return to be facilitated as soon as possible,” Kariyawasam said. Wickremesinghe told Reuters last week he was “not aware” of any plans for Rajapaksa’s return. He also said any legal action against Rajapaksa would proceed in accordance with Sri Lanka’s laws."

According to the latest World Bank assessment, Sri Lanka is only behind Lebanon, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and Türkiye. The World Bank’s latest Food Security Update states that domestic food price inflation remains high around the world, with high inflation continuing in almost all low and middle-income countries and the share of high-income countries with high inflation increasing sharply. Domestic food price inflation (measured as year-on-year change in the food component of a country’s Consumer Price Index (CPI)) remains high around the world, it said. Information from the latest month between April and July 2022 for which food price inflation data are available shows high inflation in almost all low and middle-income countries; 92.9 per cent of low-income countries, 92.7 per cent of lower-middle-income countries, and 89 per cent of upper-middle-income countries have seen inflation levels above 5 per cent, with many experiencing double-digit inflation. The share of high-income countries with high inflation has also increased sharply, with about 83.3 per cent experiencing high food price inflation. The most affected countries are in Africa, North America, Latin America, South Asia, Europe, and Central Asia. In real terms, food price inflation exceeded overall inflation (measured as year-on-year change in the overall CPI) in 81 per cent of the 153 countries for which food CPI and overall CPI indexes are both available. Sri Lanka ranks fifth in the Top 10 list with Nominal food inflation at 91 per cent (YoY), behind only Lebanon (332 per cent), Zimbabwe (309 per cent), Venezuela (155 per cent), and Türkiye (95 per cent). Sri Lanka is ahead of countries such as Iran (90 per cent), Argentina (66 per cent), Suriname (38 per cent), Ethiopia (38 per cent) and Moldova (34 per cent). Meanwhile, among the Top 10 counties with the highest Real Food Inflation (YoY), Sri Lanka ranks fourth with 30 per cent behind only Lebanon (122 per cent), Zimbabwe (52 per cent), and Iran (36 per cent).  According to the World Bank’s latest update, food price inflation remains at a multiyear high in South Asian countries. As of July 2022, Bangladesh and Nepal had not experienced major food shortages, Pakistan has experienced some decreases in wheat and rice production (because of lack of fertiliser and a heat wave), and Bhutan and Sri Lanka are experiencing significant shortages in domestic food supply. “In Sri Lanka, agricultural production has decreased by 40 per cent to 50 per cent because of fertiliser shortages, and there is a lack of foreign exchange to purchase food imports. Fertiliser and fuel (for land preparation, transport, and harvesting activities) shortages are expected to limit the food supply.” “Some relief is coming from the first shipment of 44,000 tonnes of urea supported by Indian credit (and 21,000 tonnes is expected to arrive soon). There has been an increase in demand for Indian rice, with roughly 9.6 million tonnes shipped this year.” “Exporters, concerned that export restrictions will be introduced (as has been done for wheat), are moving quickly to open letters of credit and have signed contracts to export 1 million tonnes of rice from June through September 2022.” Food price inflation reached 80 per cent in Sri Lanka, 26 per cent in Pakistan, and 8.3 per cent in Bangladesh. Across the region, governments have adjusted agricultural policies to address food security concerns, the report said. The Government of Bangladesh reduced rice import tariffs, increased the budgetary allocation to agriculture, increased fertiliser subsidies, and provided a cash incentive to exporters. In Bhutan, the Government is stocking essential food items directly and through concessional working capitals to wholesalers and retailers. The Government of Pakistan has been providing targeted subsidies and has increased coverage of social protection programmes to protect the poorest households from high food prices."

HRCSL noted that several complaints have been received by the Commission alleging that former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had tendered his resignation under threat and coercion and that the Government had failed to provide adequate security to Rajapaksa. In a letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, HRCSL Chairperson, Retired Supreme Court Justice Rohini Marasinghe observed that the complaints are based on the premise that Rajapaksa and his family are unable to return to the country due to the threats they face and that such act violates fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. “The HRCSL has gone through the complaints, it grossly violates the fundamental rights guaranteed to every citizen if that citizen cannot return to the country for extraneous reasons beyond his control and which are within the control of the State to eliminate,” Justice Marasinghe said. She added it unequivocally violates fundamental rights if all persons are not guaranteed equal protection under the law. “The complainants further alleged that the Ex-President could not return to the country unless the Government guaranteed the security he is entitled to under the law as Ex-President of Sri Lanka,” she said.  The Commission observed that Rajapaksa is entitled to certain privileges and benefits as an Ex-President established under law. She thereby recommended that the Government take all necessary steps to assess the threat and provide Rajapaksa with the protection provided under the law for an Ex-President to return to the country whenever he makes such a request. “The family of Rajapaksa now living abroad, is entitled to the protection of the law to a safe return to the country. The HRCSL recommends that the GOSL provide adequate protection to the family of Rajapaksa to return to the country,” she added."

BASL, citing a statement issued by the Sri Lanka Police that certain suspects are currently detained in relation to incidents which occurred during the protests from 9 April 2022, noted that since then Detention Orders for 90 days, have been issued, signed by the President in his capacity as the Minister of Defence detaining three protesters under Section 9 of the PTA. They observed that detention may result in the detainee being subject to torture and inhuman treatment. “The PTA is a draconian piece of legislation, which gives wide powers to the Executive to arrest and detain persons for a lengthy period of time. Although Detention Orders are amenable to the Fundamental Rights and Writ Jurisdictions of the apex courts, they are not subject to regular judicial supervision unlike instances of arrests and detention under the general law,” BASL noted. It was stated that administrative detention confers the Executive with wide powers over the freedom of physical liberty of a person and lengthy detention periods without judicial supervision go against internationally accepted standards of protections of human rights. The provisions of the PTA must be resorted to only in very exceptional circumstances where there is manifest evidence indicative of a terrorist dimension that would make resort to its use justifiable, BASL noted. The PTA was intended to address situations of terrorism and never to address offences which may have occurred during the expression of dissent against the Government such as protests for which there exist the ordinary law of the land including the Penal Code, they said. BASL noted that the PTA is now being used despite assurances by the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) that it was implementing a moratorium on the use of the PTA. BASL added that the use of the PTA has been seen as a matter of concern in granting to Sri Lanka an extension of the GSP+ by the European Union adding that abuse of the PTA has also been raised time and again at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. “In these circumstances and in the absence of a clear definition of terrorism in the PTA, there is a grave danger of it being abused to stifle legitimate expressions of dissent and to target persons who exercise their democratic rights including the freedoms of speech and expression, peaceful assembly, and association,” BASL emphasised."

He said yesterday (23) at the weekly Cabinet media briefing that Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is in the process of drafting the National Security Act. Speaking further, he noted that the PTA has been in existence since the 1970s, and that a new Act is in the pipeline to weaken the PTA, and that the Cabinet has been informed about it. He said Minister Rajapakshe is working on it. The Ministry of Defence approved a 90-day Detention Order (DO) under the PTA on Wasantha Mudalige, Convenor of the Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF). When asked if any investigation revealed that Mudalige was involved in terrorism, he highlighted that what they believe is that there is a coup underway to destabilise the Government, and the Security Forces have requested time to conduct investigations. “It is not enough to have only 24 hours to reveal the information of conspiracies. That time span is insufficient to reveal accurate information, and the relevant time was given to the forces,” he said. Gunawardena said the recent arrests of protesters using the PTA had also been discussed in Cabinet. According to the Constitution, people have complete freedom to form trade unions, picket, and protest peacefully, however, during the recent violence, 72 members of the public were systematically targeted and evicted from their homes."

He said Sri Lanka has introduced an alternative variety to the groundnut variety required for processing jumbo peanuts called ‘Sri Lanka Jumbo,’ adding that it is superior in quality to the imported groundnuts. “Therefore, there is no need to import groundnuts. The Sri Lanka Jumbo peanut variety is presently becoming very popular locally. The Department of Agriculture, which introduced this variety, says that it is high-yielding and can provide 29 per cent of the daily protein requirement,” he further said. He noted that the protein deficiency that has arisen due to rising prices of meat and fish, could be mitigated to a certain extent due to the protein content in peanuts. Amaraweera added that groundnut, which is grown as a food crop, has been cultivated beyond the national requirement of our country, with the annual requirement being 30,000 MT and the harvest exceeding 64,000 MT. “I have advised the officials of the Department of Agriculture to take measures to promote related products by using the extra yield of groundnuts.

Although there is a trend in state institutions to operate on digital systems, the information and information technology systems of those institutions are exposed to extreme risk due to insufficient attention being paid  to information and cyber protection, utilisation of age–old technology as well as shortage of skilled staff required for cyber security management in the State sector. In order to control the situation, the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT) has drafted the information and cyber protection policy for State institutions in concurrence with the National Information and Cyber Security Strategy of Sri Lanka 2019-2023 adhering to the recognised international information protection standards. It is compulsory to implement this policy by all the State institutions defined as the ‘Competent Authority’ in the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016.

The committee has recommended that it is appropriate to introduce amendments to sections 2, 5, and 8 of the Carriage by Air Act.   Amendment of responsibilities entrusted with STC Cabinet approved to amend the responsibilities entrusted with the State Timber Corporation (STC) to cater to contemporary requirements.

The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/08/23/renewables-powered-50-of-national-grid-for-41-days-ceb/,Renewables powered 50% of national grid for 41 days – CEB,Author not found,0,2022-08-22T20:30:00+00:00," Renewable energy (RE) provided over 50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s (SL’s) daily electricity needs in 41 (55.41 per cent) out of the 74 days to  Sunday (21), Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB’s)  yesterday’s (22) data showed. Meanwhile, in 32 (43.24 per cent) of the remaining 33 days to Sunday, over 50 per cent of the island’s daily electricity needs were met by fossil fuels (FFs) comprising coal and diesel and in the other single day (1.35 per cent), splits were evenly (50:50) shared between FFs and RE, respectively Consequently, RE led by ‘CEB Hydro’ provided over 50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity demand for 22 consecutive days to Sunday being equivalent to 72.50 per cent of total RE, CEB statistics further showed.  The last time, where for a period longer than this, when RE was the dominant player in Sri Lanka’s electricity sector for a consecutive number of days, took place 74 days ago, where, for30 consecutive days from 10 May to 8 June 2022, over 50 per cent of the island’s electricity needs were met by RE, once more led by ‘CEB Hydro’. However in the 233 days that have transpired in the year to Sunday, RE was responsible for providing 50 per cent or over of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs in only 72(30.90 per cent) days and FFs in the balance 161 (69.10 per cent)  days, respectively. In related developments, of the total electricity supplied by the CEB to consumers in Sri Lanka on Sunday which was  34.83Giga Watt hours (GWh), FFs share was 10.9GWh (31.29 per cent)  and RE’s share was 23.93 GWh (68.71 per cent) respectively. Sunday’s FFs breakdown comprised CEB Coal 6.5GWh, CEB Diesel 4.25 GWh and Private Sector (PS)/independent power producers’ Diesel 0.15GWh and respectively.   Sunday’s RE breakdown comprised CEB Hydro 17.35GWh, followed by CEB Wind 2.3GWh, PS Wind 2.2 GWh, PS Mini-Hydro 1.49GWh, PS Solar 0.33GWh and PS Biomass 0.26GWh, respectively. ‘CEB’s Hydro’ breakdown of Sunday comprised Mahaweli 11.02GWh, equivalent to 63.52 per cent of total “CEB Hydro”, Laxapana 4.57GWh (26.34per cent) and Samanala wewa (i.e. both Samanala wewa and Kukule Ganga hydroelectric power projects (HEPPs) together, 1.76GWh (10.14 per cent), respectively. “Mahaweli Hydro” comprises Victoria, Randenigala, Rantanbe, Kotmale and Upper Kotmale HEEP projects, respectively. Victoria, Randenigala, Rantanbe and Kotmale HEPPs were built during the J.R. Jayewardene era after obtaining grant and concessional aid from the West. Upper Kotmale, conceptualised during the Jayewardene era was built during the Mahinda Rajapaksa era after obtaining concessional Japanese aid. Samanala wewa conceptualised during the Jayewardene era was built during the Ranasinghe Premadasa era after obtaining concessional aid from Japan and Kukule Ganga conceptualised during the Premadasa era was built during the Chandrika Bandaranaike era after obtaining concessional aid from Japan. Laxapana, built during the D.S. Senanayake with Sri Lanka’s own money was subsequently extended after obtaining concessional World Bank aid. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s 2021 Annual Report, the cheapest source of electricity generation to the CEB last year was ‘CEB Hydro’, costing a mere Rs 1.67 a unit or per one kilo Watt hour (kWh) of electricity followed by Coal (Rs 10.87), non-conventional RE such as Mini-Hydro, Wind-both CEB and PS, Biomass and Solar (Rs 18.99), ‘CEB Diesel’ (Rs 29.01) and ‘PS Diesel’ (Rs 30.35), respectively However, Sri Lanka’s sole coal electricity generator, the 900 MW Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, built by the Chinese after obtaining a foreign commercial loan during the Mahinda Rajapaksa era sans tender call and incurring USD 1.35 billion of taxpayers’ money to build it, isgenerally, only partially operative for several days, forcing the Government of Sri Lanka/CEB to be over reliant on the expensive diesel to meet a large size of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs on most days.  But due to a US dollar shortage in the country led by corruption exemplified during Rajapaksa’s near 10 year tenure in office, from 17 November 2005 to 8 January 2015, Sri Lanka has no dollars to import not only the cheap coal to provide power to the country 24 hours a day, but also diesel to operate a regular bus service, resulting in partial Government offices closures during a week, which is a record, whilst aiding and abetting socioeconomic unrest in the country. In Sri Lanka’s 74-year history of independence, never once did expensive Government foreign commercial debt (GFCD) as a percentage of total Government foreign debt (GFD) exceed seven per cent other than during the Rajapaksa era. GFCD which was a mere four per cent of GFD when Rajapaksa took office in 2005, hit a record 28 per cent in 2009, before reaching a record 51 per cent in 2012 and staying that way since. An example of GFCD is the above malfunctioning coal plant. During this period, IMF’s Resident Representative to Sri Lanka Dr Koshy Mathai (2009-2013), warned the Government of excessive GFCD, but his warning fell on deaf ears. By Paneetha Ameresekere"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/08/23/norochcholai-breakdown-further-ups-electricity-bills/,Norochcholai breakdown further ups electricity bills,Author not found,0,2022-08-22T20:30:00+00:00," The ‘further’ breakdown of the 900 MW (3X300 MW) Norochcholai Coal Fired Power Plant (NCFPP) since last Monday (15), saw electricity bills being inflated by Rs 1.21 billion in the seven consecutive days to Sunday (21) alone, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) data showed. All costs are based on the Central Bank’s electricity estimates as at last year. This additional cost to the taxpayers is despite increased power cuts effective from last Tuesday (16) due to the further breakdown of NCFPP on the previous day, ie. last Monday. Subsequently, CEB increased its record daily power cuts by 200 per cent or by three fold, from one hour to three hours, effective from last Tuesday as Sri Lanka has no US dollars to either import the required diesel or to pay independent diesel power producers (IDPPs)/private sector) to ensure uninterrupted power. If, however, the NCFPP was fully functional, it has the capacity to meet 45 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity demand. But more often than not, NCPP is malfunctional, with a 300 MW plant of it being malfunctional at least since 27 June, i.e. for 57 days to Sunday and now, another of its 300 MW plants malfunctional since last Monday, resulting in NCPP being able to provide only 300 MW of power on a daily basis since last Monday. Consequently, coal provided not 45 per cent, but only 18.66 per cent (6.5Giga Watt hours (GWh) of the country’s total electricity supply of 34.83 GWh of electricity on Sunday, on the previous day Saturday,  it was 16.80 per cent (6.49 GWh), on Friday, a mere 15.96 per cent (6.51GWh) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity consumption, 15.80 per cent (6.5 GWh) on Thursday, 15.75 per cent (6.51 GWh) on Wednesday (41.34 GWh),  last Tuesday 16.05 per cent (6.5 GWh) and last Monday, 16.17 per cent (6.66 GWh), respectively. Meanwhile, last Sunday (14), with 600 MW (2X300 MW) out of 900 MW of NCFPP functional, NCFPP met 33.97 per cent (12.32 GWh) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity demand on that day. Last Sunday Sri Lanka consumed a total of 36.27 GWh of electricity. In related developments, on Sunday, the cheap and clean renewable energy (RE) met 68.71 per cent (23.93GWh) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity demand, while the imported and pollutive fossil fuels (FFs) led by coal and followed by diesel met the balance 31.29 per cent (10.9GWh).  Diesel’s contribution alone was 12.63 per cent or 4.4GWh of electricity generated on Sunday. But if NCFPP was fully functional; then there would have been no necessity to generate the expensive ‘diesel electricity’ for the country during the reference seven day period, thereby saving the taxpayer a sum of Rs 1.21 billion in the review period. NCFPP was built at a cost of USD 1.35 billion by the Chinese during the Mahinda Rajapaksa era on commercial terms sans tender call. In like developments, on the previous day Saturday, RE met 64.54 per cent (24.93 GWh) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity demand, while FFs, this time led by  diesel and followed by coal met the balance 35.46 per cent (13.7 GWh).  Diesel’s contribution alone was 18.66 per cent or 7.21 GWh of electricity generated on Saturday. on the previous day Friday, RE met 58.45 per cent (23.84 GWh) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity consumption while FFs met the island’s balance electricity consumption of 41.55 per cent (16.95 GWh), on Thursday, RE met 57.88 per cent (23.80 GWh) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity consumption while FFs met the island’s balance electricity consumption of 42.13 per cent (17.33 GWh). On Wednesday, RE met a total 57.72 per cent (23.86 GWh) of Sri Lanka’s full electricity demand, while FFs met the balance 42.28 per cent (17.48 GWh) of the country’s electricity needs. Meanwhile, in the 22 consecutive days to Sunday, over 50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity demand was met by RE led by ‘CEB Hydro’, the cheapest source of electricity to the CEB, according to CBSL. All the above costs  are based on CBSL’s 2021 cost estimates, where CBSL said that it cost the CEB Rs 10.87 to generate one kilo Watt hour (KWh) or one unit of coal electricity last year, Rs 30.35 for private sector or independent power producers’ (IPP’) diesel and Rs 29.01 of CEB’s own ‘diesel electricity’. Coal was the second cheapest source of electricity generation, ‘IPP diesel’ the most expensive and ‘CEB diesel’ the second most expensive. The cheapest source of electricity generation to the CEB last year was ‘CEB Hydro’ at Rs 1.67 a unit, according to CBSL. By Paneetha Ameresekere"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara said, kerosene price revision has been required for many years and that selling at subsidised prices is one of the main reasons for Ceylon Petroleum Corporation’s (CPC) losses. According to a Ministry spokesman, the proposal to provide a direct cash subsidy to low-income families, fisheries and plantation sectors that rely on kerosene will be submitted to the Cabinet, and distribution will  commence after Cabinet approval. When asked why the CPC decided to raise prices by more than Rs 200, he said that the CPC had been unable to raise kerosene prices for years, resulting in an unsustainable loss to the government. On 21 August, the CPC decided to increase the price of a litre of kerosene by Rs 253. The new prices are currently in effect. The previous price of kerosene was Rs 87 per litre, and the new price will be Rs 340 . As a result, the price of kerosene in Sri Lanka has increased by approximately 291 per cent.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

He claimed that Rajapaksa’s mandate is now rendered ineffective as a result of the events of the last three months. He said they are forming the new alliance for a number of reasons. “One is that the opposition is currently criticising the issues and informing the country about the people’s problems. We are aware of the issues we face. The issue for the people is that they do not know how to solve the problem. The Government is also clueless about the answers. People are also unsure of the answer to the question. The opposition presents the issue but does not offer a solution,” he said. He told the media yesterday (22) that people are tired of hearing about the problems they already have, and that everyone wants to know what the solution is. He claimed that when the SLFP merged with the UNP to form a government, the people who voted for the former were left in the dark. “What we have today is a quadrupling of the price of fuel and a rationing system that does not provide the required amount to the people. Also, we need to get the country to a point where we can consistently supply these five things: fuel, electricity, gas, industrial raw materials, and agricultural raw materials. In addition, the country will be unable to open a letter of credit from anyone for two or three months,” he said. Gammanpila went on to say that they had already decided to form an all-party government to deal with the crisis in the first week of April. “An all-party Government is not one that divides ministers among parties. An all-party Government is one that implements a programme that benefits everyone. Only then is a strategy developed before implementation. The idea of an all-party government has been around for four months. However, they have yet to present a common programme,” he said. By Thameenah Razeek"

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals.

The CIABOC said there was not enough evidence to continue the investigation further. The CIABOC revealed this following an inquiry by Transparency International Sri Lanka, which made the complaint, more than three years ago, based on the above statement made by Sirisena and several statements made by MPs, in connection with the Constitutional Crisis of 2018. The Constitutional crisis began when then President Sirisena appointed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister on 26 October 2018 before formally dismissing the then Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe. Wickremesinghe refused to resign saying Rajapaksa’s appointment was illegal.

Another UNP MP claimed he had been approached by Sirisena’s party to defect with an offer of 500 million rupees and an apartment in Malaysia along with free passage for the entire family to a foreign destination.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/08/22/norochcholai-breakdown-costs-rs-1-13b-in-six-days/,NOROCHCHOLAI BREAKDOWN COSTS RS 1.13B IN SIX DAYS,Author not found,0,2022-08-21T20:30:00+00:00," The ‘further’ breakdown of the 900 mW (3X300 mW) Norochcholai Coal Fired Power Plant (NCFPP) since last Monday (15 August), saw the taxpayers’ electricity bills being inflated by Rs 1.13 billion in the six consecutive days to Saturday (20 August) alone, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) data from yesterday (Sunday, 21 August) showed.All costs are based on Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL’s) electricity estimates as at last year (2021). This additional cost to the taxpayers is despite increased power cuts effective from Tuesday (16 August) due to the further breakdown of NCFPP on the previous day, that is, last Monday. Subsequently, CEB increased its record daily power cuts by 200 per cent or by three-fold, from one hour to three hours, effective from Tuesday, as Sri Lanka has no US dollars to either import the required diesel or to pay independent diesel power producers (IDPPs)/private sector) to ensure uninterrupted power. If, however, the NCFPP was fully functional, it has the capacity to meet 45 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity demand.But more often than not, NCPP is malfunctional, with a 300 mW plant of it being malfunctional at least since 27 June, that is, for 56 days to Saturday and now, another of its 300 MW plants malfunctional since last Monday, resulting in NCPP being able to provide only 300 MW of power on a daily basis since last Monday. Consequently, coal provided not 45 per cent, but only 16.80 per cent (6.49 gigawatt hours (GWh) of the country’s total electricity supply of 38.63 GWh of electricity on Saturday, on the previous day Friday, a mere 15.96 per cent (6.51 GWh) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity consumption of 40.79 GWh,15.80 per cent (6.5 GWh)of the country’s total electricity consumption of 41.13 GWh of Thursday,15.75 per cent (6.51 GWh)of the island’s total electricity consumption on the previous day Wednesday (41.34 GWh), Tuesday 16.05 per cent (6.5 GWh) and last Monday, 16.17 per cent (6.66 GWh),respectively.Sri Lanka consumed a total of 40.5 GWh of electricity on Tuesday, while on last Monday it was 41.18 GWh. Meanwhile, last Sunday (14 August), with 600 mW (2X300 mW) out of 900 mW of NCFPP functional, NCFPP met 33.97 per cent (12.32 gWh) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity demand on that day. Last Sunday, Sri Lanka consumed a total of 36.27 GWh of electricity. In related developments, on Saturday, the cheap and clean renewable energy (RE) met 64.54 per cent (24.93 GWh) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity demand, while the imported and pollutive fossil fuels (FFs)led by diesel and followed by coal met the balance 35.46 per cent (13.7 GWh).Diesel’s contribution alone was 18.66 per cent or 7.21 GWh of electricity generated on Saturday.But if NCFPP was fully functional, then there would have been no necessity to generate the expensive ‘diesel electricity’ for the country during the reference six-day period, thereby saving the taxpayer a sum of Rs 1.13 billion in the review period. NCFPP was built at a cost of US$ 1.35 billion by the Chinese during the Mahinda Rajapaksa era on commercial terms sans tender call. In like developments, on the previous day Friday, RE met 58.45 per cent (23.84 GWh) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity consumption, while FFs met the island’s balance electricity consumption of 41.55 per cent (16.95 GWh), on Thursday, RE met 57.88 per cent (23.80 GWh)of Sri Lanka’s total electricity consumption, while FFs met the island’s balance electricity consumption of 42.13 per cent (17.33 GWh).On Wednesday, RE met a total of 57.72 per cent (23.86 GWh) of Sri Lanka’s full electricity demand, while FFs met the balance 42.28 per cent (17.48 GWh) of the country’s electricity needs.Diesel’s contribution alone was 25.59 per cent or 10.44 GWh of electricity generated on Friday, on the previous day Thursday Diesel’s contribution alone was 26.33 per cent or 10.83 GWh of electricity generated and on the previous day Wednesday, diesel’s contribution alone was 26.54 per cent or 10.97 GWh of electricity generated. Meanwhile, in the 21 consecutive days to Saturday, over 50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity demand was met by RE led by ‘CEB Hydro,’ the cheapest source of electricity to the CEB, according to CBSL. All the above costs are based on CBSL’s 2021 cost estimates,where CBSL said it cost the CEB Rs 10.87 to generate one kilowatt hour (KWh) or one unit of coal electricity last year, Rs 30.35 for private sector or independent power producers’ (IPP’) diesel and Rs 29.01 of CEB’s own ‘diesel electricity.’ Coal was the second cheapest source of electricity generation, ‘IPP diesel’ the most expensive, and ‘CEB diesel’ the second most expensive.The cheapest source of electricity generation to the CEB last year was ‘CEB Hydro’ at Rs 1.67 a unit, according to CBSL.

Japan Embassy in Sri Lanka in this connection also said that the hospital was constructed in 1983 with grant aid from the Japanese Government as a token of appreciation and friendship to former President J.R. Jayewardene for his generous encouragement of Japan’s return to the international community at the San Francisco Peace Conference. Augmenting the historical relationship, Japan will provide latest equipment to the hospital such as CT angiography, catheter surgical equipment, transplantation devices, ophthalmology equipment, as well as establishing the new dental ward, to enhance treatment and surgical capabilities for NCDs including cancer, stroke, and diabetes, while reducing the rate of blindness and caries in Sri Lanka. NCDs patients account for over 80 per cent of all deaths in Sri Lanka and they tend to be at higher risk of severe symptoms and death when infected with Covid-19, the Embassy said. Furthermore, the current economic crisis poses a significant risk of increased NCDs due to deteriorating health and nutritional status to many citizens. “We hope this assistance will improve diagnosis and treatment of NCDs and help reduce related mortality and incidence in Sri Lanka, especially in the Western Province,” it added. Japan will remain committed to help overcome Sri Lanka’s economic crisis, together, as a long-standing development partner of Sri Lanka, the Embassy in conclusion said. (PA)"

Vidyaratna charged that the Government is resorting to such flimsy tactics to dupe the public and deviate from pressing issues faced by them. He added that the new regime has already shown through their conduct thus far that they have no concrete programme to resolve the burning issues of the masses.

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

The medicine was introduced by the then Health Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi. The drug, levothyroxine 50 mg (used for thyroxine deficiency) was introduced again in April 2022 at a function held under the patronage of State Minister, Prof. Channa Jayasumana,” CMLSSL President, Ravi Kumudesh alleged. Kumudesh yesterday (17), lamented that the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC), which knew very well the importance of pharmaceutical production to solve the country’s pharmaceutical crisis, was deceiving the public instead. Referring to the three medicinal drugs Levothyroxine 50 mg, Omeprazole 20 mg, Mefenamic Acid 50 mg launched at a ceremony held earlier this week, he said they had been manufactured by the SPMC much earlier and were distributed in state hospitals through the Medical Supplies Division (MSD). “Rambukwella had been duped into launching medicinal drugs at a ceremony held earlier this week in a bid to cover up the failure of the SPMC,” he said.  Kumudesh urged the Health Minister to develop the SPMC instead of allowing it to fool him and the public by organising such grand ceremonies to issue pharmaceuticals which had already been produced and issued by that same corporation much earlier. “Minister Rambukwella knowingly organised a function to cover up his inability to have made a positive intervention towards encouraging the production of pharmaceuticals during his tenure. Such deceptions only throw the country’s state health service into a further dilemma,” he added. Kumudesh accused the SPMC of having used the Health Minister’s official status to cover up its inability. “Health authorities are responsible to work in collaboration with the Government under a long-term plan to overcome the economic crisis in the country. For that, local production of drugs is a major requirement of which the responsibility should be borne by the SPMC.” He alleged, “The production of pharmaceuticals was deliberately discouraged during the tenure of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and no company was allowed to manufacture pharmaceuticals during that period.” He said for a lengthy period his outfit had been criticising the Government for not appointing the required officials needed for health services. Kumudesh alleged that more than 30 manufacturing companies had abandoned work during that period due to the commissions and the weakness of the management. “The Corporation had also failed to recruit a single company for drug manufacturing,” he further said.

In 32 (46.38 per cent) of the remaining 33 days to Tuesday, over 50 per cent of the island’s daily electricity needs were met by the pollutive and imported fossil fuels (FFs) comprising coal and diesel, and in the other single day (1.45 per cent), splits were evenly (50:50) shared between FFs and RE, respectively Consequently, RE led by ‘CEB Hydro’ provided over 50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity demand for17 consecutive days toTuesday (16 August), with Tuesday’s‘CEB Hydro’ percentage figure alone being 84.31 per cent,CEB statistics further showed. The last time, a period longer than this, where RE was the dominant player in Sri Lanka’s electricity sector for a consecutive number of days took place 69 days ago, where, for 30 consecutive days from 10 May to 8 June 2022, over 50 per cent of the island’s electricity needs were met by RE, once more led by ‘CEB Hydro’. Meanwhile, in the 228 days that have transpired in the year to Tuesday, RE was responsible for providing 50 per cent or over of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs in only 67(29.39 per cent) days and FFs in the balance 161 (70.61 per cent)  days, respectively. In related developments, of the total electricity supplied by the CEB to consumers in Sri Lanka on Tuesday which was  40.5 giga Watt hours (gWh), FFs share was 17.17gWh (42.40 per cent)  and RE’s share was 23.33gWh (57.60 per cent) respectively. Tuesday’s FFs breakdown comprised CEB Coal 6.5gWh, Private Sector (PS)/independent power producers’ Diesel 6.51gWh and CEB Diesel4.16gWh,respectively.  Tuesday’s RE breakdown comprised CEB Hydro 19.67gWh, followed by CEB Wind 1.34 gWh, PS Wind 0.97 gWh, PS Mini-Hydro 0.92gWh, PS Solar 0.32gWh and PS Biomass 0.11gWh, respectively. ‘CEB’s Hydro’ breakdown of Tuesday comprised Mahaweli 10.61gWh, equivalent to 53.94 per cent of total ‘CEB Hydro’, Laxapana 7.20gWh (36.60per cent) and Samanalawewa (i.e. both Samanalawewa and Kukule Ganga hydroelectric power projects (HEPPs) together, 1.86gwh (9.46 per cent), respectively. ‘Mahaweli Hydro’ comprises Victoria, Randenigala, Rantanbe, Kotmale and Upper Kotmale HEEP projects, respectively. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s 2021 Annual Report, the cheapest source of electricity generation to the CEB last year was ‘CEB Hydro’,costing a mere Rs 1.67 a unit or per one kilo Watt hour (kWh) of electricity followed by Coal (Rs 10.87); non conventional RE such as Mini-Hydro, Wind-both CEB and PS, Biomass and Solar (Rs 18.99), ‘CEB Diesel’ (Rs 29.01) and ‘PS Diesel’ (Rs 30.35), respectively However, Sri Lanka’s sole coal electricity generator, the 900 mW Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, is generally, only partially operative for several days, forcing the Government of Sri Lanka/CEB to be over reliant on the expensive diesel to meet a large size of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs on most days.

The request are to refer Sri Lanka to the International Criminal Court (ICC); to reduce Sri Lankan military presence in Tamil areas to pre-1983 level before the war started. Also, they request to stop government sponsored Sinhala–Buddhist settlements in Tamil areas, including re-demarcation of divisional boundaries to incorporate Sinhala–Buddhist areas into Tamil districts and annexing Tamil areas into Sinhala-Buddhist areas; calling for an internationally conducted and monitored Referendum to bring about a permanent political solution to the protracted Tamil conflict thereby preventing further atrocities against the Tamil people, which they repeatedly faced inter-alia in 1958, 1977, 1983 and 2009 The letter had been signed by Tamil Makkal Kootani (TMK)  leader MP C.V. Wigneswaran Selvam Adaikalanathan,   Leader of Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO)  MP Selvam Adaikalanathan, Leader of the Peoples Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE)  MP Dharmalingam Sithadthan, President of the Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) Kandiah Premachandran, Former MP Jaffna District and Leader of Tamil National Party (TNP) Nallathamby Srikantha. They also call on governments around the world to arrest and prosecute Sri Lankan political and military officers in their territories, under the principle of Universal Jurisdiction, which allows for the prosecution of serious international crimes, even if they were not committed in the country’s territory. Furthermore they said that the freedom of expression is severely restricted in Tamil areas for several years, facilitated by the extremely large military presence and restrictive laws. Chief among the restrictive laws is the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which limits and criminalises political expression. “We also would like to bring to your kind attention an open letter from 20 former high-level UN officials on 18 February 2021. The signatories included all four former UN High Commissioners for Human Rights, four former high officials of the UN, nine former Special Rapporteurs who had visited and written reports on Sri Lanka, and all three members of the Secretary-General’s Panel of Experts on Sri Lanka,” they said.

President of the Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association of Doctors (MCPA), Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa yesterday (17) warned that the national budget circular issued by the Treasury Secretary on 26 April 2022 on the ‘Control of Public Expenditure’ would result in a further collapse of the state health service owing to a shortage of health personnel and foreign trained consultants. He said according to the circular, instructions had been issued for the postponement of recruitment to positions to which appointments had not yet been made despite preliminary arrangements. Also, it calls for the suspension of state-funded foreign study tours and training due to the financial crisis the island was facing.   Dr. Sanjeewa said this move would affect the recruitment of MBBS qualified medical officers to the state health sector, so much so that it would create a shortage of doctors to run hospitals in the future. On the other hand, it would also create a shortage of consultants in the country in the next few years. The impact of this move would not be felt immediately, but repercussions would be felt in time to come, he warned. It would also increase the level of unemployment of trained health service personnel who are much needed to fill the existing shortages. Dr. Sanjeewa appealed to the President and the Finance Ministry to resolve the financial crisis, but to continue providing the required USD 36,000 for the foreign training of consultant doctors without creating a further dilemma for the state health service. The circular had noted at the time that public expenditure had to be strictly controlled, so that it could be used only for the most essential services. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

LPBOA President Gemunu Wijerathne said the association has informed the President in this regard and he commended the initiative and told him that he would inform Tourism Minister Harin Fernando to consider the proposal. Speaking to Ceylon Today yesterday (17), Wijerathne added that even after getting the President’s approval, it is hard to obtain the support of subject ministers, as they lack interest. “The association is planning to arrange a transport service which would appeal to tourists. Tourists can choose between the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and private busses or trains for their transport needs,” added Wijerathne. He requested to build a comfortable rest area at the Bastian Mawatha Bus Station for tourists to have at least one or two hours of rest, under the concept of safe transit. “Tourists will be charged ordinary bus fares. Tourists can select the types of busses and/or trains as they wish, but no additional charges will be levied from them other than transport costs,” he said. He added that the online service will be promoted by the Tourism Ministry and the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE). Wijerathne said they should take immediate action to promote our tourism industry worldwide to bring dollars to the country. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

Till Sunday, with just one of three 300 mW plants malfunctioning then as opposed to two currently, only 600 mW of electricity power out of a total of 900 m W was generated by the NCPP. But on the following day Monday, CEB reported that the second 300 mW coal plant was also malfunctioning, resulting in NCPP being functional in only a third (300 mW) of its full capacity of 900 mW and CEB increasing its record daily power cuts by 200 per cent or three fold, from one hour to three hours, effective from Tuesday, as Sri Lanka has no US dollars to import diesel or to pay independent power producers (IPPs/private sector) to ensure uninterrupted power. Monday’s NCPP breakdown only has resulted in an additional cost of Rs 386 million for electricity generation to the taxpayer for the two consecutive days to Tuesday alone by consuming the more expensive diesel to generate power, CEB data showed. If, however, the NCPP was fully functional, it has the capacity to meet 45 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity demand. But more often than not, NCPP is malfunctional, with a 300 mW plant of it being malfunctional at least since 27 June, that is, for 52 days to yesterday and now, another of its 300 mW plants malfunctional since Monday, resulting in NCPP being able to provide only 300 mW of power. Consequently, coal provided only 16.05 per cent (6.5 gigawatt hours (GWh)) of Sri Lanka’s total electricity consumption on Tuesday (40.5 GWh), while on the previous day Monday it was 16.17 per cent (6.66 GWh). Sri Lanka consumed a total of 40.5 GWh of electricity on Tuesday, while on the previous day Monday it was an enhanced value of 41.18 GWh due to reduced power cuts. In the 17 consecutive days to Tuesday, over 50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity demand has been met by the cheap and clean renewable electricity (RE) led by ‘CEB Hydro,’ the cheapest source of electricity to the CEB, according to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Dr. Perera said that this may be as a result of the young patients contracting Covid-19, influenza, or a viral infection. But the low level of testing being conducted at the LRH was one factor which prevented doctors from pinpointing the cause of the increasing number of wheezing patients that were being admitted. If 12 patients are admitted, at least six of them suffered with wheezing.  On the other hand, with the dry spell that has set in, the dust level in the atmosphere has increased. People, including young children have stopped using the mask. A smoking parent and grandparent or another family member having influenza can result in the child contracting the illness, resulting in his or her wheezing condition. The Consultant Paediatrician said patients may develop difficulty in breathing post Covid-19 or influenza. Patients even develop abdominal pain as a result. He said young patients are not tested for Covid unless they are suspected cases. But most young patients are scared of the test, he said.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne   "

In 32 (46.38 per cent) of the remaining 33 days to Tuesday, over 50 per cent of the island’s daily electricity needs were met by the pollutive and imported fossil fuels (FFs) comprising coal and diesel, and in the other single day (1.45 per cent), splits were evenly (50:50) shared between FFs and RE, respectively Consequently, RE led by ‘CEB Hydro’ provided over 50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s electricity demand for17 consecutive days toTuesday (16 August), with Tuesday’s‘CEB Hydro’ percentage figure alone being 84.31 per cent,CEB statistics further showed. The last time, a period longer than this, where RE was the dominant player in Sri Lanka’s electricity sector for a consecutive number of days took place 69 days ago, where, for 30 consecutive days from 10 May to 8 June 2022, over 50 per cent of the island’s electricity needs were met by RE, once more led by ‘CEB Hydro’. Meanwhile, in the 228 days that have transpired in the year to Tuesday, RE was responsible for providing 50 per cent or over of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs in only 67(29.39 per cent) days and FFs in the balance 161 (70.61 per cent)  days, respectively.

The request are to refer Sri Lanka to the International Criminal Court (ICC); to reduce Sri Lankan military presence in Tamil areas to pre-1983 level before the war started. Also, they request to stop government sponsored Sinhala–Buddhist settlements in Tamil areas, including re-demarcation of divisional boundaries to incorporate Sinhala–Buddhist areas into Tamil districts and annexing Tamil areas into Sinhala-Buddhist areas; calling for an internationally conducted and monitored Referendum to bring about a permanent political solution to the protracted Tamil conflict thereby preventing further atrocities against the Tamil people, which they repeatedly faced inter-alia in 1958, 1977, 1983 and 2009 The letter had been signed by Tamil Makkal Kootani (TMK)  leader MP C.V. Wigneswaran Selvam Adaikalanathan,   Leader of Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO)  MP Selvam Adaikalanathan, Leader of the Peoples Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE)  MP Dharmalingam Sithadthan, President of the Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) Kandiah Premachandran, Former MP Jaffna District and Leader of Tamil National Party (TNP) Nallathamby Srikantha.

Furthermore they said that the freedom of expression is severely restricted in Tamil areas for several years, facilitated by the extremely large military presence and restrictive laws. Chief among the restrictive laws is the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which limits and criminalises political expression. “We also would like to bring to your kind attention an open letter from 20 former high-level UN officials on 18 February 2021. The signatories included all four former UN High Commissioners for Human Rights, four former high officials of the UN, nine former Special Rapporteurs who had visited and written reports on Sri Lanka, and all three members of the Secretary-General’s Panel of Experts on Sri Lanka,” they said.

President of the Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association of Doctors (MCPA), Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa yesterday (17) warned that the national budget circular issued by the Treasury Secretary on 26 April 2022 on the ‘Control of Public Expenditure’ would result in a further collapse of the state health service owing to a shortage of health personnel and foreign trained consultants. He said according to the circular, instructions had been issued for the postponement of recruitment to positions to which appointments had not yet been made despite preliminary arrangements. Also, it calls for the suspension of state-funded foreign study tours and training due to the financial crisis the island was facing.   Dr. Sanjeewa said this move would affect the recruitment of MBBS qualified medical officers to the state health sector, so much so that it would create a shortage of doctors to run hospitals in the future. On the other hand, it would also create a shortage of consultants in the country in the next few years. The impact of this move would not be felt immediately, but repercussions would be felt in time to come, he warned. It would also increase the level of unemployment of trained health service personnel who are much needed to fill the existing shortages. Dr. Sanjeewa appealed to the President and the Finance Ministry to resolve the financial crisis, but to continue providing the required USD 36,000 for the foreign training of consultant doctors without creating a further dilemma for the state health service. The circular had noted at the time that public expenditure had to be strictly controlled, so that it could be used only for the most essential services. By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

He requested to build a comfortable rest area at the Bastian Mawatha Bus Station for tourists to have at least one or two hours of rest, under the concept of safe transit. “Tourists will be charged ordinary bus fares. Tourists can select the types of busses and/or trains as they wish, but no additional charges will be levied from them other than transport costs,” he said. He added that the online service will be promoted by the Tourism Ministry and the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE). Wijerathne said they should take immediate action to promote our tourism industry worldwide to bring dollars to the country. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

However, Chinese Ambassador Qi Zhenhong, who welcomed the vessel at the Hambantota International Port (HIP), said this was not the first time such a ship had visited Colombo, and that a similar vessel made a port call in Colombo in 2014 and such port calls are “natural” for surveillance ships. The vessel, which is a space-tracking ship, to monitor satellite, rocket, and intercontinental ballistic missile launches arrived to conduct satellite research in the northwestern part of the Indian Ocean Region, reached HIP for replenishment, and would be docked for the next six days, and many Sri Lankan and international media arrived at the Port berth area to cover the event, however, no one was permitted to board the ship, as it is a surveillance ship. The Chinese Ambassador added that the arrival of the vessel was nothing special and the vessel came smoothly to HIP and Sri Lanka and China have a longstanding friendship and the arrival of a scientific research vessel such as Yuan Wang 5 is very natural. He added that the questioning on the delay of vessel and the concerns by India should be addressed to the Indian friends. “Everybody knows why the delay occurred and I don’t have to explain about the delay.” The ship was supposed to arrive on 11 August. The ship was given a ‘diplomatic clearance’ to visit Sri Lanka, but it later told the Chinese to ‘defer’ coming to the HIP due to pressure from India that said it’s a threat to their national security. India said its Sri Lanka’s call and rejected categorically that there was any insinuation. “Sri Lanka is a sovereign country and makes its own independent decisions,” said Official Spokesperson, Ministry of External Affairs, India, Arindam Bagchi. Regarding India’s security concerns, he said it’s the sovereign right of each country and India would make the best judgment in their own interest and it naturally takes into account the prevailing situation in the region, especially in their waters. Ambassador Zhenhong further said HIP as a key cooperation project of Belt and Road Initiative, has become an important engine to help Sri Lanka’s economic recovery and enhance its independent development capability. He added that the visit of Yuan Wang 5 left its own marks for the celebration of the 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka and the 70th anniversary of the signing of the Rubber-Rice Pact, highlighting the deep-rooted traditional friendship between China and Sri Lanka. Captain Zhang Hongwang of Yuan Wang 5 said, “HIP is an international port that accommodates multinational ships. HIP will provide us with necessary ship supplies in accordance with international practice. We believe the ship’s call at HIP will deepen the exchange between China and Sri Lanka in the field of space science and technology and promote the common progress of the space industry of the two countries. It will also deepen the connection between China and Sri Lanka and further grow the friendship between people of both countries.” Meanwhile, Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG), which operates the HIP under China Merchants Port on a 99-year lease for China, requested many local journalists to register with them to see the vessel from afar with their national card, media accreditation number, and other personal details, however, they also wanted the scribes to apply for approval from the Navy and Sri Lanka Customs, which was a ‘failure’ because many could not contact the officials for approval, as they did not know who they were. Despite having collected all personal information from the media, the HIPG invitation did not specify when they may visit to see the vessel or how transportation would be arranged.

The spokesman said Minister de Silva had pointed out the importance of supplying aviation fuel without any hindrance to all aircraft arriving and departing from the island. Several private sector establishments representing the aviation services locally, said importation and distribution of aviation fuel could be made possible with the concurrence and facilitation from the Ministry of Power and Energy and the CPC. CPC officials said two crude oil vessels were expected in Colombo soon and accordingly, about 600 metric tons of aviation fuel could be provided daily through the Sapugaskanda Refinery to continue supply from Saturday (20). The Minister instructed CPC officials to prepare a systematic process on the airlines’ daily requirement for aviation fuel and the steps to be taken to supply the requirement based on a proper study. Airline representatives at the meeting pointed out that the continued supply of aviation fuel was crucial for the sustainability of the industry. Considering the increased number of flights to arrive at the BIA during the next few months with the beginning of the tourist season, the Minister instructed CPC officials to implement necessary measures in facilitating and expanding storage capacities in and outside the airport for aviation fuel.

However, there is a lack of nationally recognised guidance. The initial draft of the National Guidelines and Minimum Standards for Child Development Centres was published in 2013. This national guideline presented by the National Child Protection Authority is scheduled to be implemented islandwide covering all child development centres. Steps have been taken to introduce these national guidelines and minimum standards under the supervision and guidance of relevant experts representing all stakeholders related to the childcare sector. It was initiated with the study of the minimum standards available at the international level and since then, these guidelines and standards have been prepared by incorporating the facts of child development, law, health, and childcare in several stages. These national guidelines and standards have been formulated with the contribution of experts in the field as well as officers and staff working in child development centres. Six main areas related to childcare are covered under the National Code of Guidelines and Standards. Proposals are to be considered in terms of these standards on the establishment and registration of child development centres, staffing of child development centres, institutionalisation and re-socialisation of children, standards for physical environment and safety, child health and welfare and complaint handling, inspection and supervision of centres."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

Speaking to Ceylon Today, yesterday (15) ACBOA Chairman N.K. Jayawardane noted that prices of these main ingredients needed in the bakery industry has been already reduced in the world market. However, the concession was never given to the Sri Lankan bakery owners because of the mafia of mediators, he said.  “The Price of an egg is now at Rs 65. The Price of a bag of flour is going up steadily almost every day. The market price of margarine is definitely beyond our reach. The price of an egg in South India is Rs 18. If the government can import and sell them at Rs 30, we can reduce the prices of bread and buns,” Jayawardene said. He added that a mafia dominates the egg industry, “they even threatened us not to import eggs from India.” “There is no control of the price of wheat flour in the market. The dealers and agencies increase the prices as they wish and they do so indiscriminately, saying there is a scarcity of wheat flour in the market. The government should step in and take necessary stern action to reduce the prices of bakery ingredients,” he added. Jayawardene noted that as result of this neglect the bakery industry has been brought to a situation where they are unable to continue with their profession. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

The whole country is facing an economical and socio-political tragedy. The reason for this is that the people made the wrong decision instead of the right one in two elections held in 2019 and 2020. The latest scam happening in this bankrupt country is forming a so called All-Party Government,” he stressed. Premadasa said what needs to be done immediately is to hold an election and seek the people’s mandate, adding that there is no solution beyond that.  “Malnutrition is on the rise in the country.

The multi-purpose buildings will consist of preschool, day care centre, library, education centres for children with special needs, gymnasium and a self-employment training centre and a vocational training centre will function there. As a woman it is my duty to extend a helping hand to women to set their economic and living standards high, Senanayake said.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Weerasinghe yesterday (15) said there were at least five to six million who were yet to take the first booster of the Covid vaccine. So far only eight million of the population who obtained the first two doses of the Covid vaccine have taken the first booster dose. “Although there is a wide appeal for the public to take the second booster dose there is a large percentage which has not even taken the first of the booster doses. This is a call to them,” he said. Prof. Weerasinghe said that those above 60 years of age, those with comorbidity and have immune deficiencies should obtain the vaccine urgently. On Saturday (13) alone there were 181 cases and five deaths considering the high infectiousness of the BA.5 one can only think as to how many more people the disease would have spread from the said 181 cases on Saturday (13) alone. He urged the public to also practice health safety measures as much as possible. “We know that it is difficult to do so considering the present economic difficulties, fuel issues that assail the country. One cannot practise one metre distancing while travelling in overcrowded  buses due to the prevailing fuel crisis,” he said urging the public to do what was possible and wear the mask, wash hands once they reached their destination. With the children and elderly parents people should start thinking once more that they should not take Covid home and start re-practising 2020 and 2021 their behaviour patterns and habits. Fielding questions, Prof. Weerasinghe said that with schools commencing from 15 August 2022 (yesterday) parents and teachers and students should use the experience that they gained during the past two years. When schools closed in March 2020 no one knew what to do as there was no past experience to rely on. But living with the highly contagious disease for two years, the school community should be able to cope and ensure that schools don’t have to close again. He appealed to parents “not to send their children to school” if they or anyone at home had symptoms.    Paediatrician, Dr. B.J.C. Perera said that 90 per cent children did not suffer complications. “But they are mostly able to spread the disease more, he said.  The SLMA celebrated the first anniversary of ‘Doc 247’ help line which was initiated as means of assisting Covid patients in 2021. Consultant Physician National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Dr. Ananda Wijewickrema said that the hotline had greatly assisted in minimising the number of hospital admissions. There was large number of admissions of patients with mild and moderate symptoms who could have been managed at home. He said that it had least hospital congestion so much so that serious cases of Covid received the care that was required.    By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

That was according to the Standing Orders. Under the standing order 121, the Chairman of the COPF must be a member of the Opposition party. It belongs to the Opposition, but then the Speaker and the then Leader of the House suspended the standing orders to the Opposition. Instead of giving it to the Opposition, they gave it to the ruling party,” he added. Kiriella added, “Parliament and the country could have known two years ago the real situation of the country if the post was given to the Opposition, because we had proposed Dr. Harsha de Silva. “Even though he issued a warning in the Parliament, if he became the Chairman of the Finance Committee, his statements would have official value. If he had been appointed then, he would have told the country two years ago that the country would go bankrupt. Also, even a year ago, the IMF could have been arranged, but even then the Speaker and the Leader of the House committed a big crime,” he added.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

The President made this comment during the handing over of a Dornier 228 Reconnaissance aircraft to Sri Lanka by India.   Addressing the gathering, President Wickremesinghe emphasised on the importance of ties between the two countries.  “I have always said that we are two sides of a single coin. It is not possible to split a coin for one face to fall one way and the other face to fall the other way. For whatever it is, history has put us together and we have to stay together. What is this relationship? I haven’t got a word for it, but the closest I could come is the symbiotic relationship between the two countries. We are both marking our 75th anniversaries. I say let us commit ourselves to further strengthening our relationships.” The President called for both countries to commit to further strengthening their relationship as India and Sri Lanka share many commonalities and the two countries have to build on it. The first ever Dornier Reconnaissance Aircraft from India to enhance the maritime surveillance capabilities of Sri Lanka was inducted to Sri Lanka Air Force Fleet yesterday (15) in a ceremonial procession. Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay handed over the aircraft to President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. The Indian High Commission in Colombo said that the Dornier 228 Aircraft which was handed over to the Sri Lanka Air Force will add to Sri Lanka’s security.

The President was also accorded a special Guard of Honour by the Air Force troops. Giving a word of advice to aspiring politicians in Sri Lanka, the President said, “My word of advice to rising politicians and those who aspire for higher office, is get to know your Indian colleagues, get to know them well and get to deal with them because if you do not do that, it will be difficult for you to look at issues and understand what each other says. We have common viewpoints in many areas. We are but a small country in the middle of the ocean, while India, while looking after its own interests must also look at its role as a global power. But it is essential that we speak to them. After all India is our closest neighbour and there are many issues that are common to us of which we are in understanding of which we have to resolve. Not only issues pertaining to Indo-Lanka relations but to the region and to the world. So in these areas it is possible for us, and it has been on many occasions for us to come to an agreement or have a similar viewpoint with India. It is with those that we consolidate.”  Congratulating India on its 75th Anniversary of independence, President Wickremesinghe noted, “India today is becoming a world power and it is still on the rise and by the mid-century when we are no longer there, you could see a powerful India playing a dominant role on the global stage.”"

Weerasinghe yesterday (15) said there were at least five to six million who were yet to take the first booster of the Covid vaccine. So far only eight million of the population who obtained the first two doses of the Covid vaccine have taken the first booster dose. “Although there is a wide appeal for the public to take the second booster dose there is a large percentage which has not even taken the first of the booster doses. This is a call to them,” he said. Prof. Weerasinghe said that those above 60 years of age, those with comorbidity and have immune deficiencies should obtain the vaccine urgently. On Saturday (13) alone there were 181 cases and five deaths considering the high infectiousness of the BA.5 one can only think as to how many more people the disease would have spread from the said 181 cases on Saturday (13) alone. He urged the public to also practice health safety measures as much as possible. “We know that it is difficult to do so considering the present economic difficulties, fuel issues that assail the country. One cannot practise one metre distancing while travelling in overcrowded  buses due to the prevailing fuel crisis,” he said urging the public to do what was possible and wear the mask, wash hands once they reached their destination. With the children and elderly parents people should start thinking once more that they should not take Covid home and start re-practising 2020 and 2021 their behaviour patterns and habits. Fielding questions, Prof. Weerasinghe said that with schools commencing from 15 August 2022 (yesterday) parents and teachers and students should use the experience that they gained during the past two years. When schools closed in March 2020 no one knew what to do as there was no past experience to rely on. But living with the highly contagious disease for two years, the school community should be able to cope and ensure that schools don’t have to close again. He appealed to parents “not to send their children to school” if they or anyone at home had symptoms.    Paediatrician, Dr. B.J.C. Perera said that 90 per cent children did not suffer complications. “But they are mostly able to spread the disease more, he said.  The SLMA celebrated the first anniversary of ‘Doc 247’ help line which was initiated as means of assisting Covid patients in 2021. Consultant Physician National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Dr. Ananda Wijewickrema said that the hotline had greatly assisted in minimising the number of hospital admissions. There was large number of admissions of patients with mild and moderate symptoms who could have been managed at home. He said that it had least hospital congestion so much so that serious cases of Covid received the care that was required.    By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Meanwhile, he added that MP Harsha de Silva was supposed to be in the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) two years ago.  “The Opposition Leader and we have constantly stated, in and outside Parliament, that we will support the government through the parliamentary committees. Most people do not know the importance of these committees. After the August 2020 election, a request was made to give the chairmanship of the finance committee to the Opposition. That was according to the Standing Orders. Under the standing order 121, the Chairman of the COPF must be a member of the Opposition party. It belongs to the Opposition, but then the Speaker and the then Leader of the House suspended the standing orders to the Opposition. Instead of giving it to the Opposition, they gave it to the ruling party,” he added. Kiriella added, “Parliament and the country could have known two years ago the real situation of the country if the post was given to the Opposition, because we had proposed Dr. Harsha de Silva. “Even though he issued a warning in the Parliament, if he became the Chairman of the Finance Committee, his statements would have official value. If he had been appointed then, he would have told the country two years ago that the country would go bankrupt. Also, even a year ago, the IMF could have been arranged, but even then the Speaker and the Leader of the House committed a big crime,” he added. He further said that the whole country was misled by saying that the government hd plenty of money till the end. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Wigneswaran, speaking about his recent meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, said it appeared that the impending Geneva meeting in September was more important to the President rather than solving Tamil problems. The MP said although the President assured them that he will take action to implement the 13A, they felt the invitation was to join the Government.  “We met him along with our Party senior member S. Selvendra at 4.30 p.m. on 10 August 2022 at the Presidential Secretariat. The Prime Minister was also present. The President explained to us at length his plan of governance which included a Parliamentary governance committee giving a greater role to the Provincial Governors. His idea was that all MPs from Provinces must govern the respective Provinces under the Chairmanship of the Governors in terms of a National Agenda. He referred to Austria as an example. (His example was inappropriate. Austria is a Federal Country).” Further discussing the grabbing of lands in Provinces by Central Government Ministries, MP Wigneswaran said the President agreed that there no forestry land should be grabbed by Ministries and they should focus on preserving the environment in each Province. The President has said, if needed a maximum of two acres could be taken over by the Government. However, Wigneswaran has responded that no land should be appropriated by the Central Government in the Provinces except with the consent and concurrence of the respective Provincial Government. “There was no response from the President to that,” noted the MP. Regarding National Schools, the President has reiterated that 50 National Schools were enough for the country not 1,000 but Wigneswaran had  pointed out that no Provincial Schools could be taken over by the State and that their Alliance has already filed action in this regard. “The President appeared to be in a hurry to rope in Jaffna MPs to be part of the Government, I suppose to showcase to Geneva! I don’t blame him. The Government has so far ignored its obligations to the UN as per Resolution 46/1,” MP Wigneswaran pointed out. “He wanted me to share a document which outlines the proposal on how money could be channeled into the Country from the Diaspora. It became apparent to us, while discussing with him, that his plan was to strengthen the Central administrative control of the entire Country totally ignoring the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. “I pointed out to the President that the Tamil people in this country expect the government to take speedy action to attend to their requests, submitted by all Tamil National party leaders, which included the release of political prisoners, action to trace the missing persons, stop the activities of various government departments to grab Tamil lands and stop persons trying to build Buddhist temples in Tamil homeland with the help of the Military and so on. It was also pointed out that in order to enable the Tamils to give political leadership and governance over their Provinces, the 13th Amendment to the Constitution should be implemented in full as a temporary measure, until satisfactory constitutional reforms are made. “We told the President that until this process is started in earnest satisfying the Tamil people, we will support the Government from the Opposition. There was no question of our becoming a part of the Government,” MP Wigneswaran outlined. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

The 134m-long PNS Taimur arrived at the Colombo Port on a formal visit on 12 August. The ship is expected to remain in the island until 15 August and the crew of the ship will take part in several programmes organised by the Sri Lanka Navy to promote cooperation and goodwill between two Navies. Further, PNS Taimur is expected to conduct a Naval exercise with the Sri Lanka Navy in the western seas on its departure on 15 August. The prime motive of these exercises is to enhance interoperability, partnerships and goodwill as well as exchange best practices with foreign Navies. As part of this Passage Exercise, PNS Taimur and SLNS Sindurala are expected to conduct Manoeuvring exercises and Search and Rescue exercise. Sri Lanka Navy said it has conducted similar Passage Exercises with the navies of countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Japan, Germany, UK, Russia and Australia on a number of previous occasions. Conducting similar naval exercises with regional and extra-regional navies will enable each partner to overcome common maritime challenges in the future, through enhanced cooperation.

Wickremesinghe sent a letter to Dissanayake, expressing his disappointment over the JJB boycotting the meeting to discuss forming an All-Party Government. The JJB, in its reply letter, strongly emphasised that it is futile to join a Government that has been already formed as a part of Rajapaksa Regime. However, the party is ready to respond positively if the President presents any realistic programme with a specific time frame to resolve this crisis, Dissanayake said. “If there was a sincere desire to go for an interim all-party programme by presenting a short-term solution to the economic, political, and social crises, that opportunity was former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s departure from the country,” he added. “However, that great opportunity is long gone now,” he stressed. Dissanayake added that the President is inviting the opposition parties to form an All-Party Government, but at the same time he is maintaining the State of Emergency in the country, trying to obtain Court orders to take away the right to protest. “Further, a government formed through the present Parliament under the names of ‘All-Party’ or ‘Multi-Party’ has no mandate or moral right to rule the country for an extended period.” “We strongly emphasise that an election should be held and a new mandate should be given,” he added.

Neesham struck three fours from the last three balls and 23 runs from the last over of the innings as New Zealand made 185 for 5 after being sent in to bat at Sabina Park. Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner took 3 for 19 as New Zealand restricted West Indies to 172 for 7. “There was a lot of spin which was a big surprise,” said Santner, who was voted the Player of the Match. New Zealand’s innings had two parts, separated by a lengthy rain break. Openers Martin Guptill and Devon Conway gave the tourists a strong start, putting on 62. But the pair fell to consecutive deliveries from Odean Smith, who went on to take career-best T20I figures of 3 for 32. The rain came in the 12th over with New Zealand on 95 for 2 and Williamson at the crease with Glenn Phillips. Players were off the field for almost two hours and when play resumed New Zealand immediately lost Phillips for 17. The New Zealand innings briefly lost momentum but Williamson re-established the impetus of the innings by taking 33 runs from his next 18 deliveries. Neesham struck a six from the second ball of an over in which he also was dropped by Romario Shepherd from the bowling of Jason Holder. West Indies paid the price with Neesham’s three fours from the last three balls. “I was happy with the performances,” West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran said. “Santner bowled very well and Ish [Sodhi] got away with a few. Scores above 175-180 are tricky for us. “ Brooks (42), Pooran (15 from 8), Holder (25 from 19) and Powell (18 from 12) all threatened to take control of the game but couldn’t carry on. Finally, Shepherd and Smith shared a 50 partnership from 23 balls for the eighth wicket to fan West Indies’ hopes, but West Indies came to the last over needing 26 runs and the task proved too much. Brief scores: New Zealand: 185/5 (Williamson 47, Conway 43, Smith 3-32) West Indies: 172/7 (Brooks 42, Santner 3-19)"

The EU- Sri Lanka tweeted that the EU is a partner in challenging times and for the EU its protection of civil and human rights and above all freedom of expression and right to dissent is of utmost importance. “We agree to bring back on track the required joint and inclusive action,” the EU Envoys told the President. On foreign affairs, the EU said they encouraged the President to devote special attention to three key processes such as the GSP plus for Sri Lankan imports, the acquisition of the IMF bailout package for Sri Lanka and also to concentrate on the Human Rights Council. “The EU hopes that concrete steps will be taken by the government to make these processes a success,” the ambassadors said. The EU is Sri Lanka’s second-largest trading partner after China and its second main export destination, absorbing 22.4% of Sri Lankan exports in 2020. Also, the Council of the EU adopted, on 19 November 2020, the EU’s third EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy (2020-2024) which provides for a renewed political roadmap that sets the priorities for positioning the EU as a credible global actor seeking to defend EU values and interests.

It is also the considered view of Direction Sri Lanka those elections must be held as soon as possible, as it is only through a process of election that the true will of the people could be represented in governance. They said the Constitution guarantees equality and equal protection of the law. “However, we have seen lately that there is effort being taken by Law Enforcement Authorities to apprehend protestors who are alleged to have violated the law, whilst on the other hand, there is appearance that this same Law Enforcement Authorities have taken a more lenient position in respect of members of the former Government who are alleged to have violated the law, especially on 9 May 2022,” the institutions said in a press release. There is also public concern that whilst this enforcement takes place, brazen damage to public property as took place in the Chamber of Parliament during the Constitutional Coup of 2018 have passed without due sanction or enforcement. The other main demand of Direction Sri Lanka is upon the reintroduction of the provisions of the 19th Amendment, for steps to be taken to appoint persons with highest integrity and ability to the Independent Commissions. This is vital in order to ensure the independence of these Commissions. A principal demand of Direction Sri Lanka and the people has been to rescind the 20th Amendment to the Constitution and to reintroduce the provisions of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution with necessary amendments addressing the democratic way of governance. Direction Sri Lanka notes that a new draft of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, bringing most of the positive features of the 19th Amendment has now been approved by the Cabinet. Direction Sri Lanka has some concern with a few provisions of this proposed draft which it will shortly share with the Minister of Justice for due consideration, and impresses that there is need to conclude this process without any further delay."

With the shortage of domestic gas and fuel, the use of electric equipment has increased,” he said. Sampath said if the CAA Chairman and Trade Minister do not act to provide the concessions, the canteen owners will have to take stern action. “Prices of yogurt, ice cream, soft drinks, milk packets and even chicken will be increased, as they must be refrigerated.

After the incident on 10 August, the Immigration and Emigration Department sent a letter of notice stating that her visa has been cancelled and she should leave by 15 August. “We regret to notify you that your visa under MED/002918 has been cancelled, and you are advised to depart the country by 15 August,” the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration said.

The EU- Sri Lanka tweeted that the EU is a partner in challenging times and for the EU its protection of civil and human rights and above all freedom of expression and right to dissent is of utmost importance. “We agree to bring back on track the required joint and inclusive action,” the EU Envoys told the President. On foreign affairs, the EU said they encouraged the President to devote special attention to three key processes such as the GSP plus for Sri Lankan imports, the acquisition of the IMF bailout package for Sri Lanka and also to concentrate on the Human Rights Council. “The EU hopes that concrete steps will be taken by the government to make these processes a success,” the ambassadors said. The EU is Sri Lanka’s second-largest trading partner after China and its second main export destination, absorbing 22.4% of Sri Lankan exports in 2020. Also, the Council of the EU adopted, on 19 November 2020, the EU’s third EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy (2020-2024) which provides for a renewed political roadmap that sets the priorities for positioning the EU as a credible global actor seeking to defend EU values and interests. On August 4, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the EU Commission Josep Borrell Fontelles, who met Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, said that they focused on recent developments in Sri Lanka, mainly on the bilateral relations and cooperation. The EU will continue to support Sri Lanka to work on political, economic and financial stability, he added. Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe said they are already preparing to face the upcoming United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in September and the report was being readied. The report will be ready on the human rights, reconciliation process and the progress of the work done by the institutions such as the Ministry of Judicial, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reform were discussed.

It is also the considered view of Direction Sri Lanka those elections must be held as soon as possible, as it is only through a process of election that the true will of the people could be represented in governance. They said the Constitution guarantees equality and equal protection of the law. “However, we have seen lately that there is effort being taken by Law Enforcement Authorities to apprehend protestors who are alleged to have violated the law, whilst on the other hand, there is appearance that this same Law Enforcement Authorities have taken a more lenient position in respect of members of the former Government who are alleged to have violated the law, especially on 9 May 2022,” the institutions said in a press release. There is also public concern that whilst this enforcement takes place, brazen damage to public property as took place in the Chamber of Parliament during the Constitutional Coup of 2018 have passed without due sanction or enforcement. The other main demand of Direction Sri Lanka is upon the reintroduction of the provisions of the 19th Amendment, for steps to be taken to appoint persons with highest integrity and ability to the Independent Commissions. This is vital in order to ensure the independence of these Commissions. A principal demand of Direction Sri Lanka and the people has been to rescind the 20th Amendment to the Constitution and to reintroduce the provisions of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution with necessary amendments addressing the democratic way of governance. Direction Sri Lanka notes that a new draft of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, bringing most of the positive features of the 19th Amendment has now been approved by the Cabinet. Direction Sri Lanka has some concern with a few provisions of this proposed draft which it will shortly share with the Minister of Justice for due consideration, and impresses that there is need to conclude this process without any further delay."

AICOA Chief Asela Sampath said the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) Chairman and Trade Minister should implement a plan to grant concessions to reduce prices of essential commodities for people in rural and town areas, at least through Sathosa outlets. He added that with the increase in the electricity tariff, the CAA Chairman and subject minister have gone into hiding. “The burden from raising the electricity tariff will be mitigated to some extent if the standard retail price of essential goods provided to people in rural and urban areas is reduced. The canteen system in the country is not running with the use of solar panels. They all use electricity as the main power source to operate electrical equipment such as deep freezers, refrigerators, water heaters, and rice cookers to prepare meals. With the shortage of domestic gas and fuel, the use of electric equipment has increased,” he said. Sampath said if the CAA Chairman and Trade Minister do not act to provide the concessions, the canteen owners will have to take stern action. “Prices of yogurt, ice cream, soft drinks, milk packets and even chicken will be increased, as they must be refrigerated. We can’t turn refrigerators on and off frequently,” he added. By Nabiya Vaffoor"

Fisheries Minister Devananda went on to say that he was committed to resolving the country’s foreign reserve shortage by resolving the grievances of fishermen who bring in foreign income. “It is planned to extend the Kalpitiya Fishery Harbour’s breakwater by 75 metres. The feasibility studies for the proposed project are currently underway and close to completion. I have directed the relevant officials, including Ceylon Fishery Harbour Corporation General Manager Mudalige, to put the development plan into action as soon as possible,” Devananda said. The Minister said, he met with the owners of 23 multi-day fishing trawlers in the Kalpitiya area and that halting shrimp harvesting by the trawlers had a significant impact on national and local economies. Exporting shrimp can generate a significant amount of foreign income. However, according to the Fisheries Act, trawling is prohibited. In this regard, a foreigner has filed a case in court. This problem is difficult to solve. Without waiting for the judgement in this case, a cabinet paper is being prepared, and a Fisheries Act amendment bill will be introduced in Parliament as soon as possible after receiving cabinet approval. He noted that steps will be taken to develop the Udappu anchorage with necessary action to improve the economic and living standards of families depending on fisheries. “Necessary arrangements will be made to provide kerosene to fishermen Udappu and Chilaw areas from a fuel shed in the region”.

Rajapaksa has sought to travel to Thailand today, a third country in the Asian region after fleeing Sri Lanka due to mounting pressure from the massive demonstrators.  Following an extraordinary financial crisis and a lack of fuel and gas that displeased the masses, Rajapaksa was forced to leave his Presidential House at Fort on 9 July when demonstrators stormed into the house. He fled the country on 14 July for the Maldives, as arranged by Mohamed Nasheed, Speaker of the Maldives Parliament, after hiding on board a Sri Lanka Navy ship.

The Opposition Leader requested Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to make a statement clarifying the matter. On Tuesday (9) during the Cabinet Media briefing, Gunawardena said property damage and other incidents related to Parliament cannot be dealt with under the regular law of the country, and the matter could only be addressed within Parliament and that it cannot be even questioned by the Courts. Gunawardena made this claim, when a journalist questioned him on the fairness of cracking down on protesters who occupied State buildings on 9 July, when MPs who damaged Parliament property under the former government are yet to be arrested. In response to Gunawardena’s claim, Premadasa said the Cabinet Spokesman misled the country with regard to the violence and property damage which occurred in the Parliament Chamber during the ‘52-day conspiracy’ in 2018. “Are Parliamentarians exempted from the Penal Code and Offences Against Public Property Act? Gunawardena is sending a wrong message to the country that there is a separate law inside Parliament,” Premadasa said. Gunawardena, replying to Premadasa, said he only stated that MPs have parliamentary privileges and the MPs attending Parliament cannot be arrested, as they are engaged in legislative activities. At this juncture, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella said parliamentary privileges only prevent MPs from being arrested when they are on their way to attend and when they leave Parliament. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, who intervened in the discussion, said all laws in the country are applicable to MPs, and no one is exempted from the country’s criminal laws under the Parliament Powers and Privileges Act.

He, however, insisted that withdrawing from Galle Face does not mean that the protest or ‘Aragalaya’ is over. He said at a media briefing from Galle Face yesterday (10), that protesters leaving the area does not mean the end of the struggle, adding that they hope to continue the protests in towns and regionally. “Galle Face became the focal point of protests for the entire country, and they will continue to fight for system change. The suppression of protesters has increased significantly today, and protests will intensify as a result of such efforts. The Government will be unable to put a stop to such protests,” he said. Speaking further, he highlighted that they believe the Aragalaya has expanded into villages and that they are prepared to summon the public if injustice occurs. Actor Jagath Manuwarna, who also took part in the protest, said if people believe President Ranil Wickremesinghe will take steps to address the country’s problems, they will give it some time. “We will see how things go for a while. How will he deal with the issues? The crowd is small because people believe Wickremesinghe is doing well. This is only a pause, not a complete stop.

Fr. Jeewantha Peiris, yesterday informed Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage that his client will be appearing in Court on 12 August, in connection with the protest incident at Galle Face Green. Counsel Arsecularatne PC made this submission via a motion filed in Court. He stated that after being informed that his client had been named as a suspect in the incident, where it has been alleged that his client had engaged in a protest in violation of an order issued by Court, his client had made a request, to grant him approval to appear in Court. Accordingly Magistrate Gamage stated that necessary measures should be taken, having informed the concerned parties, as the next date for the case has been set for 12 August. The Attorney General on Tuesday (9) objected to the Fundamental Rights Petition filed by Rev. Fr. Jeewantha Peiris on the basis that he is avoiding Court procedure. This was when the FR Petition, filed by Fr. Peiris, seeking an order to prevent his arrest in connection with the alleged unlawful assembly in front of Police Headquarters and damage to public property, during the anti-Government protest, was taken up before Supreme Court Justices S.T.B. Dehideniya, S. Thurairaja, and Yasantha Kodagoda. The Senior State Counsel, making submissions on behalf of the Attorney General, observed that Fr. Peiris has avoided Court procedure, to which Counsel Arsecularatne PC, who appeared on behalf of Fr. Peiris, said no notice of any arrest or case was served to his client. The Senior State Counsel observed that Fr. Peiris was wanted as a suspect in a case, to which Arsecularatne responded if so that surrendering his client will be considered. The Court then ordered to file limited objections and further hearing was fixed for 1 September. It was stated in the Petition, by Fr. Peiris, that the imminent arrest without reasonable grounds would violate his Fundamental Rights. IGP C.D. Wickramaratne, SDIG in charge of the Western Province, Deshabandu Tennakoon, the Attorney General, and others were named as respondents to the Petition. The Colombo Fort Magistrate previously imposed overseas travel bans on six individuals involved in the anti-Government protests including Fr. Jeewantha Peiris.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

Furthermore, according to the present law, the President can appoint the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka without consulting any faction, and the clause was not amended even through the 19th Amendment.

Consultant Community Physician, Dr. Dilini Wijesekara yesterday 9 said, prior to 2019, an average of 2,000 patients with leprosy had been detected per year. In 2019, a total of 1,660 leprosy patients were diagnosed. She lamented that 181 of them had been child cases (10.9 per cent of patients below 14 years). She said, 40 per cent of the total cases had been from the Western Province, while the remaining cases that were detected that year were from the Eastern, Southern, and North Western Provinces.  Last year, the number of cases detected diminished further to 1,026 owing to the Covid-19 outbreak in the country and in addition to the other prevailing issues with regard to the disease which affects the peripheral nervous system (PNS) which contributes to the visible deformities which occur in patients during the advanced stages of the disease, she said.   The Consultant Community Physician said only 398 cases of leprosy had been detected from January till the beginning of the second week of August this year. She said 47 of the cases diagnosed were children, 84 cases from the total were from the Batticaloa District, while the remaining patients were from Gampaha (46), Kalutara (35), Colombo (23), and Kegalle (45). Responding to queries, Dr. Wijesekara said lack of social awareness that leprosy is curable if detected early and stigma were two of the main causes for people with symptoms to avoid seeking medical attention. She said community and health staff were responsible for the misdiagnosis of leprosy.  If a person develops hypopigmented, copper coloured or red coloured patches, they should go to a dermatologist or the Outpatient Department and seek assistance from a qualified doctor. Dr. Wijesekara explained that 60 per cent of patients were infected with “multibacillary” leprosy which was infectious. However, what should be remembered is that only long-term contact with a patient spreads the disease. The infectivity of multibacillary leprosy patients wean off two to three days after commencing treatment, she said ALC Director, Dr. Prasad Ranaweera, when contacted said, leprosy was a neglected tropical disease and that the Campaign hoped to work towards disease elimination by creating wide-scale awareness, encouraging people with symptoms to seek early medical attention. People tend to neglect “pale patches” that develop on their skin, leading to a delay in seeking medical attention. He said the ALC would initiate a social marketing programme titled ‘Leprosy Initiative for Elimination’ (LIFE)Sri Lanka this month to create awareness and encourage early detection.      By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

He said as per Provisions contained in the Penal Code, any attempt either covertly or otherwise, made to overthrow a legally elected Government is a serious punishable offence by the law. He said its severity is such, if convicted, such people, could be handed down even the death sentence or slapped with a minimum of 20 years RI. Taking part during a weekly political talk show, aired on a private television channel on 5 August, the veteran criminal lawyer, observed that all subversive elements attached to the ongoing protest movement in the metropolis, should be weeded out, as per the law, for the sake of this country and its citizens. He said it was imperative the law is enacted in its sternest form by the Police to root out the subversive and extremist political leaders of certain political parties. He opined that such leaders are determined to assume power via the spilt blood of the youth, as they cannot ever seek a genuine mandate from the electorate. Walaliyadda explained that illegal and forced occupation of State-owned institutions, such as the President’s House, Temple Trees, PMs Office and the Presidential Secretariat, by anyone, is a severe offence, as per Provisions contained in the Penal Code. He however, agreed as per the Constitution, freedom of speech, expression of dissent and engaging in peaceful protests or demonstrations were guaranteed. But, he was quick to stress, nobody has the right to coax anyone to overrun State institutions and damage properties, in order to vent their vehement anger and overthrow the Government of the day. The President’s Counsel also cast serious doubt on whether the present-day 225 MPs in the current Parliament, would be able to usher in the so-called system change as desired by the protesters.  (JK)"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He said as per Provisions contained in the Penal Code, any attempt either covertly or otherwise, made to overthrow a legally elected Government is a serious punishable offence by the law. He said its severity is such, if convicted, such people, could be handed down even the death sentence or slapped with a minimum of 20 years RI. Taking part during a weekly political talk show, aired on a private television channel on 5 August, the veteran criminal lawyer, observed that all subversive elements attached to the ongoing protest movement in the metropolis, should be weeded out, as per the law, for the sake of this country and its citizens. He said it was imperative the law is enacted in its sternest form by the Police to root out the subversive and extremist political leaders of certain political parties. He opined that such leaders are determined to assume power via the spilt blood of the youth, as they cannot ever seek a genuine mandate from the electorate. Walaliyadda explained that illegal and forced occupation of State-owned institutions, such as the President’s House, Temple Trees, PMs Office and the Presidential Secretariat, by anyone, is a severe offence, as per Provisions contained in the Penal Code. He however, agreed as per the Constitution, freedom of speech, expression of dissent and engaging in peaceful protests or demonstrations were guaranteed. But, he was quick to stress, nobody has the right to coax anyone to overrun State institutions and damage properties, in order to vent their vehement anger and overthrow the Government of the day. The President’s Counsel also cast serious doubt on whether the present-day 225 MPs in the current Parliament, would be able to usher in the so-called system change as desired by the protesters.  (JK)"

Nonetheless, GoSL’s FVMP debt has been over Rs 3 trillion for a record consecutive 24 market days to Tuesday due to a perennial lack of revenue. GoSL’s at least theoretical MP borrowing costs (BCs), decreased by 0.61 per cent (Rs 781.28 million) to Rs 126,675.53 million on Tuesday, led by buying pressure of riskless and now, high  yielding (T) Bills and T Bonds in secondary market trading by investors, over preference to lend to the private sector, the engine of growth. Liquidity was enhanced by Rs 22,750 million (US$ 63.05 million) on Tuesday led by the settlement of transactions between the GoSL and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). Conversions are based on the administered value of the benchmark ‘spot’ which was Rs 360.80 to the dollar on Friday. Market was short for a record 226 market days to Tuesday, with yesterday’s increase being by 1.57 per cent (Rs 9,418 million) to 607,612 million, thereby virtually causing perpetual rate pressure. GoSL’s highest to the 229th highest FVMP debt has been registered for a record 229 market days to Tuesday. Transactions between CBSL and the GoSL are foreign reserves-neutral. CBSL, which administers open market operations, lacks transparency. GoSL’s FVMP debt is equivalent to the totality of CBSL’s T Bill and T Bond holdings. MP is the exclusive right of CBSL. GoSL’s MPBCs are prorated to the outcome in secondary market trading of T Bills and T Bonds on the reference day. ‘Spot’ trades are settled after two market days from the date of transaction. CBSL, the steward of GoSL debt and its foreign reserves deals in ‘spot.’ The ‘spot’ is administered to minimise GoSL’s foreign debt in rupee terms and lower the cost of ‘essential’ imports, while ‘essential’ imports are met from the country’s foreign reserves and not from the market, to prevent further depreciative pressure on the rupee, as Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/08/10/electricity-tariff-up-by-75-from-today/,Electricity tariff up by 75% from today,Author not found,0,2022-08-09T21:05:00+00:00," The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) approved the new electricity tariff hike of 75 per cent which will be effective from today (9). Accordingly, the PUCSL has rejected the Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB) proposal to increase electricity tariffs by 229 per cent, capping off tariff hikes at 75 per cent. Chairman of the PUCSL Janaka Ratnayake said the PUCSL has imposed a number of conditions on the CEB for the rate hike. These include the opening of a bulk supply transaction account, conducting an independent dispatch audit for 2021, renewing and revising purchase and sales agreements and payment of interest for security deposits obtained from consumers. Furthermore, the PUCSL had requested that no bonuses should be given for CEB staff until finances become stabilised. Commenting on the new tariff revision, Ratnayake said, the PUCSL managed to keep the electricity rates at a stable level for the last nine years. He said with the increase in the cost of electricity generation, the CEB had submitted two proposals to the PUCSL to increase the tariffs by 183 per cent and 229 per cent. “Both these proposals were not approved. I would like to point out that we have taken steps to increase a reasonable tariff rate instead. As per the provisions of the PUCSL Act, we have also sought public inputs before approving the tariffs. The Commission decided to approve a fair electricity tariff, taking all these public and other stakeholder comments into consideration. Although it costs 32 rupees to generate a unit of electricity at present, the entire cost burden is not imposed on electricity consumers to protect the majority of consumers in the domestic sector. The category with consumption less than 30 units will be charged 25 per cent of the cost,” he said. Speaking further, he said they still get 75 per cent of subsidy and the consumers come under the category of above 31 units and below 60 units is charged 40 per cent of the total cost. He added they get a 60 per cent of subsidy and only 50 per cent of the actual cost is charged from the categoryof units above 61 and below 90. “A 50 per cent of subsidy is also given to that category. Accordingly, I must emphasise 75 per cent of the electricity consumers are still being subsidised even with the new tariff revision. Steps have also been taken to encourage electricity consumers to promote renewable electricity generation with the tariff revision decision. During the public consultation on the tariff revision, the users of solarsystems pointed out that charging a monthly fee on their overall consumption is unfair. Accordingly,the PUCSL decided that the fixed charges should be determined on the basis of net consumption after deducting the amount of electricity units generated from their total consumption. With that decision being implemented, the electricity consumers who own solar power systems do not have topay a monthly fixed fee if they generate electricity more than the consumption,” he said. Speaking further, he noted 1,324 people and institutions had submitted comments and suggestions during the public consultation process of the electricity tariff revision, while 46 people participated in giving oral comments. The opinions presented by the public are majorly pointing out that there should be fairness in the electricity cost, the cost should be affordable and the need for electricity conservation. “Considering the facts presented by the public, the new tariff revision was approved in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Act. At the same time, we decided to impose conditions on the CEB to implement the suggestions that arose at the Public Consultation process. The conditions include conducting an independent audit has been specified with specific dates with regard to purchasing electricity. These conditions should be met by February next year. With that, the public can take action on the proposals made regarding the fairness of the electricity cost. Lanka Electricity Private Company (LECO) started paying interest for security deposits of electricity consumers last year. We decided that the Ceylon Electricity Board should also start paying interest on electricity consumer guarantee deposits from October,” he said. Ratnayake noted that the new tariff revision has been prepared to provide relief to the hotel sectorand the industrial sector. The revenue requirement, as filed by CEB, is Rs 505 billion (excluding LECO costs) requiring 82.4 per cent increase in revenue to recover the forecast cost for 2022. When the proposed Tariff revision is applied, the overall revenue increase is forecast at Rs 512 billion (including LECO sales) meaning a 79 per cent increase, he said. BY Thameenah Razeek"

In this backdrop, China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin said it is “completely unjustified” for certain countries to cite so-called “security concerns” to put pressure onSri Lanka. Diplomatic clearance for the Chinese vessel to make acall at the Hambantota Port from 11-17 Augustfor replenishment purposes was conveyed by the Ministry to the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Colombo on 12 July, which the Government approved. Subsequently, in light of the need for further consultations, the Ministry has communicated to the Embassy of China in Colombo to defer the visit of the said vessel to the Hambantota Port, the Foreign Ministry said. The Yuan Wang 5 vessel belongs to China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Strategic Support Force (SSF). Wenbin, at the media briefingin Shanghai on 8 August, urged the relevant parties to see China’s marine scientific research activities in a rational light and stop disrupting normal exchanges and cooperation between China and Sri Lanka. He said they have noted relevant reports and stressed on two points. First, he said Sri Lanka is a transportation hub in the Indian Ocean. Scientific research vessels from various countries including China have made port calls in Sri Lanka for replenishment. “China always exercises freedom of the high seas in accordance with law and fully respects coastal countries’ jurisdiction over scientific research activities in waters under their jurisdiction.” Secondly, he said, Sri Lanka is a sovereign country. “It has the right to develop relations with other countries based on its development interests.To have normal cooperation is the independent choice made by our two countries. It serves the shared interests of both sides and does not target any third party. It is completely unjustified for certain countries to cite the so-called ‘security concerns’ to pressure Sri Lanka.As Sri Lanka grapples with economic and political difficulties, to grossly interfere in Sri Lanka’s normal exchanges and cooperation with other countries is to exploit its vulnerability, which is morally irresponsible and against the basic norms governing international relations.” The postponement of the vessel entering the Southern port of Hambantota comes amid India making a formal submission to Colombo about an impending security threat to India if such a military platform is allowed to enter the Indian Ocean Region and dock for seven days at the Southern port.  On 4 August, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met at the bilateral meeting in Cambodia, where Minister Sabry said he had reassured the Chinese of the enduring friendship and excellent relations between Sri Lanka and China which remain on a solid foundation. Minister Sabry referred to Sri Lanka’s firm commitment to the OneChina policy, which has been a consistent principle in the country’s foreign policy.  By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

Former Western Provincial Council Member and TNAG Chairman Dr. N. Kumaraguruparan publicly urged Sampanthan to assist President Wickremesinghe in carrying out his special mission. He observed that President Wickremesinghe addressed every crucial issue in a pragmatic and extremely well-balanced speech. TNAG said the Tamils forum in Colombo, perhaps some TNA stalwarts, have already alerted the TNA Leader not to accept any Cabinet Portfolio.“We reiterate that unlike the previous Good Governance, it is President Wickremesinghe who gave the new assurance. At a critical hour when there is a call for all leaders to come forward to save the country, a government, economy, and people it is with self-confidence of his acquired calibre and historical international support President Wickremesinghe accepted the challenge. Hence, there is a necessity to support him.” “Sampanthan of the TNA needs to support an Interim Administration.Sampanthan must back the All-Party Government that the President has asked for. “Tamil leaders too cannot lead the people of the North and East towards starvation.

The 55th ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (AMM) was held on 3 August 2022 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.The Meeting was chaired by Cambodia under the theme ‘ASEAN ACT: Addressing Challenges Together.’ “We reaffirmed the need to enhance mutual trust and confidence, exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability, and avoid actions that may further complicate the situation,” said the statement issued on Friday. The group reaffirmed the need to pursue peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with the universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS. China has been unilaterally changing things on the ground in the South China Sea. In the middle of the global coronavirus pandemic, it was busy increasing its presence in the SCS. It approved the establishment of two districts to administer disputed Paracel and the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. Before that, Beijing had issued new names for 25 islands or reefs and 55 undersea entities in the South China Sea in a bid to reaffirm its sovereignty in the region.The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982, is an international agreement that establishes the legal framework for marine and maritime activities. It is also known as Law of the Sea. It divides marine areas into five main zones namely-Internal Waters, Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the High Seas. “We stressed the importance of undertaking confidence building and preventive measures to enhance, among others, trust and confidence amongst parties, and we reaffirmed the importance of upholding international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS,” the statement said. UNCLOS is the only international convention which stipulates a framework for State jurisdiction in maritime spaces and provides a different legal status to different maritime zones. “We emphasised the importance of non-militarisation and self-restraint in the conduct of all activities by claimants and all other states, including those mentioned in the DOC that could further complicate the situation and escalate tensions in the South China Sea,” the ASEAN statement said. ASEAN reaffirmed the importance of maintaining and promoting peace, security, stability, safety, and freedom of navigation in and overflight above the South China Sea and recognised the benefits of having the South China Sea as a sea of peace, stability, and prosperity. It underscored the importance of the full and effective implementation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) in its entirety. “We welcomed ongoing efforts to strengthen cooperation between ASEAN and China, and were encouraged by the progress of the substantive negotiations towards the early conclusion of an effective and substantive Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) consistent with international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS, within a mutually-agreed timeline.” ASEAN welcomed the resumption of physical textual negotiation of the Single Draft COC Negotiating Text through the convening of the 36th JWG-DOC on 25-27 May 2022 in Siem Reap, and looked forward to the early conclusion of an effective and substantive COC that is in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS. “We emphasised the need to maintain and promote an environment conducive to the COC negotiations, and thus welcomed practical measures that could reduce tensions and the risk of accidents, misunderstandings, and miscalculation,” the statement said.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Attorney General gave this undertaking when a writ petition filed by Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) challenging construction of reservoirs and roads in Sinharaja Forest was taken up before the Court of Appeal. State Counsel Navodi de Zoysa appearing for the Attorney General informed court that the authorities would not construct new roads and repair any existing road network within the Sinharaja Forest. CEJ and its then Executive Director (now Senior Consultant) Hemantha Withanage filed this petition in April 2021 naming Conservator General of Forests, Central Environmental Authority, Minister of Environment, Minister of Wildlife and Forest Conservation, Minister of Irrigation and Attorney General as respondents. Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprising Justice Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Justice Dhammika Ganepola fixed the petition for support on 6 September. Meanwhile, the court directed the authorities to submit a report pertaining to intended construction of a reservoir within the state forest lands in the Sinharaja Forest Reserve. This was pertaining to petitioner’s request to submit physical demarcations of Sinharaja. The petitioners stated that over the past 15 years, the promotion of low-country tea cultivation and the opening of new roads have set in motion dramatic changes in the Sinharaja forest reserve and its buffer zone. Settlers have flooded into the area and population pressure has increased. They said high profit margin of tea has improved living standards, but it has also provided a tremendous incentive for the clearing of natural rainforest. The Petitioners further stated that recently it was reported in the media regarding an alleged plan to construct a reservoir covering a landmass of five hectares within the Sinharaja forest. The proposed project would move water from Gin and Nilawala rivers to Giruwapattuwa and will provide water to Tangalle, Beliatte, Weeraketiya, Walasmulla, Dambarella and other areas. The petitioners also stated that construction of reservoirs at Madugate and Kotapola and construction of two tunnels Madugate to Kotapola and Kotapola to Ampanagala and Neluwa–Lankagama road Lankagama–Deniyaya road will negatively affect the biodiversity of the already fragile eco system while violating the existing laws.

The Additional Magistrate made this order after the FCID of the CID reported to Court that it commenced a probe into the sugar scam, following instruction of the Committee on Public Enterprises on 21 June 2022. The Government in October 2020 reduced the levy imposed on 1 kilogramme of both white sugar and brown sugar from Rs 50 to 25 cents, which, according to the recent report issued by the Auditor General, only benefited the trade community and the benefits were not passed on to consumers. According to the Auditor General’s report, even following the tax reduction, Lanka Sathosa had sold sugar bought from private sector importers from time to time and it had resulted in a loss of about Rs 102 million to Lanka Sathosa during the period from 14 October 2020 (from the date of tax reduction) to 8 February 2021 (up to the date of removing the price ceiling). It was observed by the report that even Lanka Sathosa, which is a government institution, had not taken necessary action to purchase sugar at the stock control price imposed by the Government and this loss was an additional charge on the Treasury. Further according to the report, Pyramid Wilmar (Pvt.) Ltd had also increased its sugar imports by 1,222 per cent during the period from October 2020 to February 2021. BY Hansi Nanayakkara"

WFP’s emergency food and nutrition operation aims to assist 3.4 million of the Sri Lankans most at risk of food insecurity and malnutrition amid record food inflation, skyrocketing fuel prices and widespread shortages of essential commodities. “We are deeply concerned about the impact of the current economic and political crisis on the people of Sri Lanka. The food shortages and increasing prices have a particularly adverse effect on children and women. We consider it an urgent priority to address the immediate food and nutrition needs. Norway is now contributing NOK 5 million (approximately Rs 189 million) to the efforts of the World Food Programme in assisting the most vulnerable groups in Sri Lanka,” announced Trine Jøranli Eskedal, Norwegian Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives. “We are grateful to the Norwegian Government for this much-needed contribution to WFP’s efforts to assist 3 million people struggling to meet basic food needs. Acting now helps us to reduce the impact of the crisis on the poorest, most vulnerable Sri Lankans,” said Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, Representative and Country Director for WFP in Sri Lanka. WFP is boosting existing social safety net programmes to assist one million children through the national school meal programme, one million targeted beneficiaries as part of a government programme which provides fortified food to mothers and children, and almost one and a half million people in need of emergency food assistance through food, cash, or vouchers. Nearly 6.3 million people – or 3 in 10 households – are food insecure and in need of assistance. WFP’s recent surveys indicated that 61 per cent of families are resorting to at least one coping mechanism, including eating less, eating less nutritious food, and even skipping meals altogether. The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organisation, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability, and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters, and the impact of climate change."

This situation has arisen because the majority of QR codes are created by bookstores and communications. Consumers claim that people who obtain faulty, printed papers or codes that have been removed from stations present them subtly to fuel stations and obtain fuel. It has also been observed that some people have copied licence plate photos and conveniently pasted them on their vehicles. Then, by photographing them, someone can use their fuel fraudulently. A retired teacher, who obtained a QR code from a shop in Naula town, claims that when he went to get fuel the next day, he received a short message that the quantity of fuel had been obtained for the same number that morning. A lot of information has been reported about many such incidents, and many fuel station owners have stated in their comments that people should take care not to let others have their QR codes. By I.

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The Additional Magistrate made this order after the FCID of the CID reported to Court that it commenced a probe into the sugar scam, following instruction of the Committee on Public Enterprises on 21 June 2022. The Government in October 2020 reduced the levy imposed on 1 kilogramme of both white sugar and brown sugar from Rs 50 to 25 cents, which, according to the recent report issued by the Auditor General, only benefited the trade community and the benefits were not passed on to consumers. According to the Auditor General’s report, even following the tax reduction, Lanka Sathosa had sold sugar bought from private sector importers from time to time and it had resulted in a loss of about Rs 102 million to Lanka Sathosa during the period from 14 October 2020 (from the date of tax reduction) to 8 February 2021 (up to the date of removing the price ceiling). It was observed by the report that even Lanka Sathosa, which is a government institution, had not taken necessary action to purchase sugar at the stock control price imposed by the Government and this loss was an additional charge on the Treasury. Further according to the report, Pyramid Wilmar (Pvt.) Ltd had also increased its sugar imports by 1,222 per cent during the period from October 2020 to February 2021. BY Hansi Nanayakkara"

Surveillance at airports and harbours should be increased. That means even fishing harbours should be under surveillance if cases were not to be missed. There was a risk of the monkeypox reaching Sri Lanka even with the drug smuggling activities that were taking place.  “It’s very much like Covid-19, where suspect cases with fever symptoms should be identified before they enter the country through the entry points,” he observed. The current situation in Sri Lanka   may aid the highly infectious disease -although not a major risk like corona it would spread fast. The public transport service alone, in which the majority of people have to travel due to the fuel situation, was one high risk area as highly congested buses and train carriages with the  presence of even one case of monkeypox could prove a heavy risk, he cautioned.    The GMOA Media Committee member said however that the Health Ministry had taken action to beef monkeypox surveillance at the points of entry to the country.  The Health Ministry issued a circular to the Deputy Directors General of   National Hospital, Colombo and Kandy, Provincial and Regional Directors of Health Services, and the heads of Health Institutions, on ‘Surveillance, notification, investigation and laboratory testing of cases of monkeypox virus.’    Director General Health Services (DGHS), Dr. Asela Gunawardena said that once a suspect case was identified, all health care institutions should report immediately to the Chief Epidemiologist of the Epidemiology Unit. Also the Epidemiology Unit could be contacted for any clarification or assistance.  Dr. Gunawardena further noted that hospital admission of a suspect or probable case of the virus should be decided by the clinician following a thorough evaluation of the patient. Contact tracing should be initiated by the public health authorities with the guidance of the Epidemiology Unit, he noted. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared monkeypox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern which has prompted the Health Ministry to strengthen its surveillance activities to identify, notify and manage any suspected case of the virus in a bid  to “prevent a spread in the country,” the DGHS stated.     By Dilanthi Jayamanne "

Fr. Valence Mendis said. Fr. Mendis queried about the fate of the Bribery Commission.“Before all this, at the very least, the previous 19th Amendment to the Constitution should be reinstated,”he said, adding that everyone should have realised this by now.“People cannot be duped indefinitely by childish stories laced with rhetoric.” He likened Sri Lanka to a ship which had suffered an engine failure.“Everyone is looking for the paddle to help them get ashore. I am not sure if those on board would have to swim,” he said, adding that not everyone knew how to swim. “This country’s political leaders have brought the country to an unimaginable state. It is not something that happened in two or three years, but something that took 50 or 60 years of governance. We are all indebted to other countries,”Bishop Mendis lamented, appealing to the country’s leaders to think about the citizens before thinking about anything else. “Think of the plight they find themselves in today. Fathers and brothers of families are forced to spend hours and days in fuel queues, fishermen struggle without fuel to go to sea to earn a living,farmers are struggling without fuel and fertiliser, while children are starving without food. Think about the plight of helpless mothers! Think of how to redeem the citizens of this country as early as possible.” “Long-term plans are good. But first think about how to raise those people who are dropping dead or fainting on the side of the road due to starvation and stress,”Bishop Mendis urged the leaders of the island.  “Think of ways and means to bring down the cost of essential goods and medicines and submit proposals. This kind of sadness, injustice, and pain has never been seen in our country even during the 30-year war,”lamented the Chilaw Bishop. He said the country’s leaders should first find solutions to these problems before talking about anything else. He urged them to hold all-party conferences and discuss these issues. “Who should be held responsible for this situation,” he queried. “Does this country have no law to probe this, or is the law non-functional? The same thing happened with the Easter Sunday Attacks in 2019. The Presidential Commission report clearly names persons who should be investigated. Why are they not being spoken about?,” he queried.

Accordingly, the minimum bus fare, which was Rs 38, will now be Rs 34, the National Transport Commission (NTC) announced. Addressing a media briefing, at the Department of Government Information, Director General of the NTC Nilan Miranda said the drop in the price of a litre of diesel by Rs 10 last week, led to the decision to revise bus fares. “The bus fare revision is applicable to 350 routes and instances. We reduced the bus fares after considering the recent fuel price revisions and also since buses are now transporting passengers above the seating capacity,” he added. He said the bus fares were increased by 20 percent in November 2020 on the premise that buses can operate only based on the seating capacity of the vehicles, since the regulation is not being followed at present, they decided to reduce the fares by 10 percent. Accordingly, the bus fares of Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), private and inter-provincial buses will be reduced. However, fares of expressway buses will not be amended. Miranda said operators must display the revised fares in their buses from, today (5). Meanwhile, mobile inspectors will be deployed to oversee whether the correct fares are being charged in buses.

The MP said the media reports show concerns about the potential docking of the ‘Yuan Wang 5’ in a Sri Lankan port. According to reports, the vessel would conduct satellite control and research tracking in the northwestern part of the Indian Ocean region. The space-tracking vessel operating a space-ground information exchange especially provided significant data support to Zhongxing-2E satellite’s orbit determination and entry and has now passed sailing Taiwan towards Hambantota in Sri Lanka. The vessel’s visit has raised concerns for India. The position of the SLMC on warships, military or naval craft being allowed into Sri Lankan waters is based on the broad principles of national sovereignty, international peace and security, and non-alignment, he added. “The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress continues to advocate for the vision of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. This vision, which was promoted by Sri Lanka during the Cold War period, in our view is more relevant today than ever before. “We envision and remain committed to working with all progressive sections of the wider Indian Ocean community to ensure that we take all practical and meaningful steps to make the Indian Ocean safe and secure at all times, in which peaceful navigation and economic activities beneficial to littoral states take place, contributing to the stability and prosperity of all states.” He said the Indian Ocean mission and movement are perceived to not manifest the spirit at any times, under any circumstances, and by any party. “In this context, it is also pertinent to note that Sri Lankan leaders have given repeated assurances that nothing inimical to the security of India will be permitted within the territory or territorial waters of Sri Lanka. Therefore, it is now the responsibility of the Government of Sri Lanka to ensure that it takes all meaningful measures necessary to realise these objectives.” By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"

There was also a question as to whether the health service too would be able to bear the strain in such an event. “Health services would also be affected by the coronavirus. Therefore, there is a serious question as to how far the health service would be able to sustain the weight of a disease burden,” he warned. The Union member called for the Health Ministry to create public awareness with regard to the real situation of Covid-19 in the country. He said there had been a question as to whether the citizens had been aware of the coronavirus situation in Sri Lanka during the four waves of the infection experienced during the past two years. “There were large-scale discussions, speculations and accusations regarding data collection, statistics of the number of infected patients, and the daily deaths. If the public had been aware of the real situation in the country, they may have been more careful about maintaining good health practices.” He said the Health Ministry should take action at least now to communicate the true situation with regard to the infection to gain public support in controlling it. Dr. Wijesinghe said measures should also be taken to get the required technical support needed to control and prevent a disease spread. Specialist advice should be sought from those in the related field. Advice should be called from persons in epidemiology, disease control, with regard to the coronavirus infection. “Necessary policy and technical decisions should be taken through a specific consultative process and implemented as soon as possible,” Dr. Wijesinghe said.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/08/04/president-proposes-25-year-economic-policy/,President proposes 25-year economic policy,Author not found,1,2022-08-03T20:55:00+00:00," Stating that his planning is not for his own betterment, but for the young generation of the country, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said if Sri Lanka is built through a solid national economic policy, it would be able to become a developed country by 2048, when the 100th Independence Anniversary will be celebrated. “I am not like other politicians. I have a long-term vision and plan. I clearly know that I would not eat the fruit of the tree that I plant. But tomorrow, our future generations will enjoy the fruit,” he said. Wickremesinghe said this while delivering the Government’s Policy Statement yesterday (3) at the inauguration of the Third Session of the Ninth Parliament. The President again invited parties in Parliament to unite in the formation of an All-Party Government. “After 1977, we failed to modernise and adjust with time. Without focusing on modernisation of the economy, we were engaged in competitive, short-sighted, and destructive narrow politics. We have now minimised power cuts, we are in the process of bringing fertiliser required for cultivation. There is no shortage of gas, and soon everyone would be able to obtain it without queuing. Precautionary measures have been taken to avoid food shortages. Bringing essential drugs and medical equipment to the hospitals have been initiated. Schools have been reopened.” The President thanked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian people for their assistance provided to Sri Lanka at this critical juncture. “Presently, the immediate requirement before us is fuel. While appreciating the international assistance in addressing the fuel shortage, we have to initiate a system for such importation from our own export income and foreign remittances,” he said. Wickremesinghe said a framework which will be the basis for the country’s future journey will be presented through the Interim Budget. Speaking about the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on afour-year programme, he said the discussions will be continued from this month. The finalisation of the debt restructuring plan has commenced in collaboration with Lazard and Clifford Chance, who are international financial and legal experts. We would submit this plan to the IMF, he added. “Our economic legacy is based on foreign trade. From the ancient times, Sri Lanka was known worldwide as a major economic hub located on the Maritime Silk Road (MSR). Our ultimate goal is to re-establish that past legacy to create a strong and developed green economy.” “As a result of the economic crisis we are facing today, the income disparity in society is widening. The middle class is shrinking. On the other hand, businesses and industries are facing serious challenges, exacerbated by the loss of employment. The amount of remittances sent by migrant workers to Sri Lanka has dropped, for several reasons. This situation is gradually changing, and we are taking measures to encourage remittances to Sri Lanka through the banking system. Tourists mostly come from the month of August. Necessary initiatives are being taken to attract more tourists to Sri Lanka,” he said. Wickremesinghe said he is taking measures to establish a Social Justice Commission. “Enormous loss was caused to our country due to opposing foreign investments. People are also aware of the losses caused to the country due to corruption and fraud,” the President said. When we tried to develop the oil tank complex in Trincomalee together with India, it was stated that Sri Lanka would be a sell-out to India and this development project was halted. If at that time we were allowed to develop the oil tank complex, today people would not have to spend many days in queues for fuel. Even when the ‘Suvasariya’ ambulance service was initiated, a similar objection was raised. Some doctors held media briefings stating that “if the patient comes to the hospital by the ‘Suvasariya’ ambulance service, deaths will occur.” When Japan offered to establish the Light Rail Transit (LRT) and develop the Container Terminal in the port, it was opposed by giving a number of baseless reasons. Therefore, our country lost more than USD 3 billion in investments. Regrettably, the traditional friendship between Japan and Sri Lanka has been adversely affected.” The Government is presently preparing a National Economic Policy for the next 25 years which lays the foundation for a social market economic system, securing development for the poor and underprivileged groups and encouraging small and medium entrepreneurs. Our aim is to create a surplus in the primary budget by the year 2025. Our effort is to raise the economic growth rate to a stable stage, in order to establish a solid economic foundation by the year 2026. At present, public debt is 140 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Our plan is to bring this down to less than 100 per cent by the year 2032. If we build the country and the economy through the national economic policy, we would be able to become a fully developed country by the year 2048, when we celebrate the 100th anniversary of independence. The struggle that started all over Colombo expecting system change was later centralised in Galle Face. This was expanded to several major cities in the island. This struggle was conducted on a non-violent basis and creative manner. These activists did not commit any act of violence. Therefore, families joined the struggle to express their protests. Parents were not afraid to even bring children to the protest sties. Protesters once digitally illuminated the walls of the Presidential Secretariat, without any harm. Although, later this non-violence was suppressed and violence emerged, with certain politicised groups that became stakeholders. By indulging in violence, the protests turned towards terrorism. I do not allow violence and terrorism. However, I will protect non-violence and democracy. Peaceful struggle is a fundamental right. I accept those rights, he added. Wickremesinghe rejected that he is engaged in a witch-hunt against the protesters. “That is not true. I have no grudge towards peaceful protesters. I will establish an office to protect the peaceful protesters and support them,” he said, and added that the law will be applied equally to the people who attacked the peaceful protesters on 9 May and those who are engaging in violence and terrorism under the guise of the struggle. “I kindly request the people not to stay in unauthorised places anymore, and therefore, request the peaceful strugglers to vacate the unauthorised places and assist to maintain law and order,” he said. “I consider that the creation of a new Constitution with new attitudes in order to provide space for youth is one of the main priority tasks. At present, the President has the full right to appoint the members of the Election Commission, Public Service Commission, Police Commission, Judicial Service Commission, etc. I directly say that it is not a favourable condition for democracy. We should change that condition. Presently, it has inherited more power to the President than a previous king of Sri Lanka. It should be changed immediately. As I mentioned earlier, measures are being taken to establish the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committees immediately.” Ever since I entered politics, I wanted to create a society with a Sri Lankan identity without these divisions, the President said, adding that although many criticised his attempts in the past to achieve that, he is happy to see that people, especially the youth have accepted that they want to continue his policies. It is also essential to provide a political solution to the issues faced by the Tamil community for a long time. They are suffering with many social and economic issues due to the hardships of war. There are many land issues that need to be resolved. We have to think anew about the development tasks in the North, he said. “Similarly, women, who are the majority of the population, still face issues of harassment, violence, and other discrimination and inadequacy. We have to take necessary measures to change this situation.” I am taking measures to establish a People’s Assembly to decide which social and political reforms should be implemented, he said.  By Gagani Weerakoon and Methmalie Dissanayake"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Amaraweera also said scholars, farmers’ representatives, farmers’ organisations, and several other stakeholders have also submitted their ideas and suggestions. Amaraweera further said although a ban on glyphosate is in place at present, some have smuggled it from India and sold it at an inflated price of Rs 12,500 for four litres, adding thereby that experts on the subject of agriculture and several other are presently being consulted to lift the ban. He said following receiving the recommendations, a Cabinet Paper will be submitted if a decision to lift the ban is arrived at. By Faadhila Thassim"

He said there was no mention about any of the roles, responsibilities, or the time period regarding the All-Party Government in the Policy Statement presented by the President yesterday in Parliament. “We proposed an All-Party Government where every party can contribute. However, it did not work. We will not become stakeholders to an All-Party Government of ‘Ranil Rajapaksa.’ We will not back such a government,” he said. However, if the President can present a short-term programme for the present crisis, we can move forward by giving our proposals for that, Dissanayake added.

He said striving to aspire to the highest political office in the land against the well-established and entrenched VIP family circle, had placed his own life at risk. But, the MP pointed out he had still attempted to rid the Nation of its myriad of issues, because of his genuine desire to usher in a new political culture, though his efforts ultimately proved to be in vain. The MP said this during a weekly political talk show aired on a private television station on 1 August. “During the past 74-year period since independence, Sri Lanka has had only four politicians or people, who have strived hard to tackle this particular well ensconced VIP family circle,” he opined. “They are namely Vijaya Kumaratunga, Rohana Wijeweera, R. Premadasa, and V. Prabhakaran. But, see what plight they faced in the end. All four lost their lives basically on the road. See what sort of predicament those in this VIP family circle have faced. They’ve always led majestic lives and they have not suffered a pitiful plight as faced by those four that I have named. That is the political travesty of this country. Hence, by the same token, I too decided to follow in their footsteps by coming forward to contest the secret ballot in the House to elect the new President. It is beyond me to say right now what my future political plight would be. Let time be the judge of that.” The MP explained those in the political grapevine are well aware of the cash that has been exchanged between rival groups of MPs, on the eve of the secret ballot in Parliament. He said on the eve of the vote, he had 117 confirmed votes, which had shrunk by 35 on the day of the ballot, which alone underscores the fact that money had been thrown about faster than those at the IMF could cope with. The MP, known for his forthright views, said his private mobile phone continues to be tapped to this day, by powerful elements in the Government. But, he emphasised he will under no circumstance, deviate from his long-held belief of dismantling the well-established formidable VIP family circle here, for the future betterment of the people and the country. Alahapperuma, a long-time ally of the Rajapaksa clan, could not be directly drawn on whether he had severed his links with the former First Family or not. But, he expressed deep remorse over his party’s failure to fulfil the aspirations placed on the SLPP Government by 6.9 million people, who had voted for former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa at the 2019 Presidential Election.

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

Addressing the media at the Parliament complex, after the ceremonial opening of the third session of the ninth Parliament, yesterday (3), he added that the Policy Statement was positive, but the President should walk the talk. “We think positively about the content of the speech.

It is proposed to establish a committee comprising Party Leaders, a People’s Council and an Oversight Committee to implement the said action plan,” he said.

It had been stressed that the need of the hour is an independent Central Bank. But its relevance or impact on surviving the current economic crisis was not spelt out. It was very correctly hinted that the independence may be for the survival of the Central Bank and its officers who spend time in air-conditioned rooms away from the crisis, only, as there cannot be any benefits beyond, as the entity – the Central Bank, should have a living economy first. Central Bank- Just another harmless entity? The Central Bank of Ceylon that was established by the Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949, was definitely an essential establishment that had a role to play. It was well equipped and logically well-staffed and it was an institution that continued the traditions that started at the University of Ceylon that provided scholars who were destined to man positions which were noted as the most essential seats of knowledge. Most of the outstanding students of economics ended up in the Central Bank and their vigour and commitment continued their influence. Although it was not the best that happened in the political history of Sri Lanka, the signs that started after 1953 about the necessity to have more futuristic aspirations prompted the scholars of the Central Bank  to be more enthusiastic. The year 1956 marked a drastic change in ‘national sentiments’ had unhealthy aspirations when it came to political aims but became more meaningful towards the national economy. The necessity to have a kind of a guided plan was a correct approach, towards the country achieving economic strength became well understood. The Central Bank became the ‘nerve centre’. The real changes started after 1970 with the feeble efforts to return to pre-1956 status. The 1971 Insurrection became the climax of the near aimless wandering. Central Bank- Becoming a vitally important entity Now when we look back, it gives only some kind of pain that cannot be defined. It is a pain linked to regrets which would remind us of failures, except for the brief spell that would make us feel that the Central Bank was under the best and the right kind of authority that materialised as the able leadership of Dr. N.M. Perera  and Prof. H.A. De S. Gunasekera who became directly involved. They interpreted the Central Bank’s role well and influenced the commercial banks, ministries departments that included Sri Lanka Customs. The sincere ‘go-getters’ like Dr. Colvin R. De Silva, Peter Keuneman, T.B. Subasinghe  and all the socialist administrators like Doric De Souza became exemplary and effective. One of the best things that could have happened, happened then. It is refreshing to note that, the small measures taken became very effective. Import Substitution and Export Promotion became the key words and the Central Bank spelt out the measures. One such example was the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme (FEECS) which encouraged foreign exchange savings by way of a system that called for a Duty Guarantee / Duty Rebate system that supported exporters. According to that system, all export oriented imports could be cleared under a bank guarantee which was called Duty Guarantee and that got settled with the Duty Rebate that was awarded after the relevant export was effected. Attached to that, there was another incentive and that was the CRA = Convertible Rupee Account-which allowed an exporter three per cent of the export earnings, made available for the exporter to import for personal use. Both those schemes promoted Foreign Exchange earnings while encouraging its conservation. The point I wish to raise here is the fact that the Central Bank was one of the most important wheels on the machine and the role of that wheel was the control and coordination. All the exporters knew what they were expected to do. That kind of an environment prevented misusing foreign exchange. An export cycle passed through imports, clearance of cargo using Duty Guarantees and then when the export was effected, the Duty Rebate was processed and the obligation came to an end. The exporters were busy competing to become the best. The coordination did not end there as the Central Bank was keeping all the commercial banks under its supervision, and aspects such as Duty Guarantees. It was a time when the Central Bank acted in the expected manner and the effect was very positive as the reserves started growing. It was a case of simple logic-producing resources to pay for essentials. It is this process that takes place, in the economy of any country. As no nation has been gifted with all the resources, it is unavoidable that it is that surplus that has to create enough revenues into a one convertible strength to solve that problem.  Why did the Central Bank become so important? In the same manner that no one shall be ‘self-sufficient’ it is necessary that some surpluses are created in whatever possible and that is exactly what a simple farmer would do. He will use his surplus by converting into money and uses that to buy his family’s other needs. A country or a nation is made up of such families and it is those individual surpluses converted, which becomes that country’s revenue and that revenue should be enough to what is needed. The organised plan for creating surpluses shall become the plans for all the activities in an economy. We name them as industries having agriculture as the most basic with mining coming next and so on. The human labour component is named as ‘services’. In this kind of a ‘kindergarten explanation’ the activities of a nation can be described and we can call that collective picture as the economy of a country. A government of a country plans for the national combination of needs. A farmer will think about his family’s needs and a village blacksmith will think about the total revenue needs and he is sane enough to understand that he cannot make that good by doing what work that comes to him only and therefore find time to create some additional support. Families and individuals will think at their personal levels, and logically, it shall be the Government making the plans. As the individuals will be committed to monitor, whose responsibility shall it be to monitor on a government’s behalf? That was why it becomes necessary that there should be some well-connected authority to monitor the economic performances of a Nation. In different countries that have different names for such entities but by their functions they are the same.  Here, we have the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The misconception that Central Bank is doing just a ‘guard duty’ is just hilarious as the position taken as,  “Our job is managing Monetary Policy to ensure the stability”, is simply an irresponsible statement, some ex-Central Bankers gloating by stating that “…..how cleverly and vigorously they conducted tough negotiations to beg and borrow an additional Dollar to augment the Foreign Exchange Reserves” is definitely not a feat to brag about. Beginning of the End It started with the regime change in 1977, with the Central Bank getting away from its position of responsibility and accountability. The forces of ‘Open Economy’ encroached the recovering economy of Sri Lanka. We were an economy trying to stabilise the National Resources, nut became exposed to all the imaginable as well as the unimaginable destructive forces that acted mercilessly. The new class of businessmen gave a false sense of confidence, and the shortcuts strengthened such feelings, and slowly, the Central Bank was reduced to a glorified record keeping agency, where even the veracity of the records could be based on guesswork, duly certified as authentic as those came from the actually existing sources. Although it happened to the contrary, the Central Banks cannot escape from the responsibility for the negative developments, as such establishments are responsible collectively. Sri Lanka witnessed the economy being driven from once a developing economy down towards an environment where free trading took over the cautious operations, evolving into a begging and a debt-driven trading economy. All the Governors had talked of debt restructuring, as it was always the case. In order to get the grip of the issue the Central Bank should have been in the middle planning national targets and following up debt sustainability do that everything was disciplined. But what happened was just the opposite and the experts could explain just how those things had happened. The open economy that came after 1977 closed all possible avenues for a self-sustaining economic environment to embrace a system where it became a game for importers to be smart and become speculators to make a ‘fast buck’, caring a damn for the economic independence to end up as a new tradition and a set of traders who always made money in every transaction they did without caring about sustainability. The simplification of import procedures gave the finishing touches to the coffin for the Sri Lankan economy and it simply happened unaware as the planners did not bother. A sizeable chunk was for uncontrolled imports of motor vehicles and almost all types of flashy cars, where foreign exchange reserves ended up can be understood by visiting used car parts yards in Sri Lanka. It is valuable foreign exchange appearing as non-moving stocks, offered as security collaterals to the Banks and Banks have not supported their best clients. It is this loose system of controls by the Central Banks that has allowed things to happen like that. Then the so-called experts on monetary policies hold post-mortems. It is evident that the senior functionaries of the Central Bank had been reduced to ineffective officials as the Central Bank has now become just a rubber stamp only. The agony of Sri Lanka is not something that fell from the sky as what we are going through now is a result of the total indifference shown towards the signs which indicated a very grave end. In the meantime, those who enjoyed being top officials just acted only to survive while the problem related to IMF was getting more and more complicated. Those responsible officials acted only as a post box, by keeping matters updated only to show what was happening around. Beyond that it was not their responsibility, and it is the possible outcome as finding solutions was not their concern. This makes one wonder why nothing remedial could happen in spite of the fact that the Central Bank was officially present in the provinces too. If the history of the Central Bank’s activities is analysed, it shall be proved that it had been reduced only to an incidental presence and nothing beyond, just a namesake. Prof. W.D. Lakshman wished to promote a debt-free country but could not continue and the circumstances led to his resignation, not to mention the court cases he may have to face. Although things were kept away from common knowledge, it is now known that Prof. Lakshman was doing his best to hold the exchange rate stable when the par value of the Dollar or the Rupee value of the Dollar was lower. It is said that he had come under severe criticism, some had argued it would promote diverting Dollar earnings from official sources to the black market. So, the die-hard supporters wanted the Rupee to be floating. His successor let the Rupee float and now it is around Rs 360 to a Dollar. But did black market disappear? Dollars did not come through official sources. What such theoreticians do not have the simple knowledge to understand how negatively that will affect the Value Adding Industry and its effect on the imported foods where even rice, which is the staple food, is also affected. Cannot they understand simple economics that the Sri Lankan cost of production will rise and retard growth?  The effect of the Covid-19 pandemic hit the economy so mercilessly, economic growth became non-existent. It was the initiative of the Central Bank that mitigated the effect on the economy.  The Central Bank took  necessary steps to ease the burden on the general public during that disruption of global scale, while preserving its legal mandate to maintain economic, price and financial systems stable as much as possible. Realisation Mistakes are the best teachers. We have made our mistakes and now there should not be any difficulties in understanding where we had gone wrong. Let us understand what the IMF wants and that is where our planning should start. Divide the amount into four blocks and take it as four periods of six months each and have a financial target for each block of six months. First six months – agricultural awakening- targets for import substitution. Even if the results are not realised, the signs of achievements shall be visible. With a sound distribution system the people shall be at least better fed. Second six months – consolidation of agricultural targets for import substitution, can be supported by minor exports to some selected markets from where, some of the most essential imports can be initiated. That way, the local markets shall be well supplied. The sound distribution system already introduced shall ease the needs related problems. Third six months – consolidation of agricultural targets for export and import substitution, can be supported by regular exports to some selected markets from where, some of the most essential imports can be initiated on a barter system. That way, the local markets shall be well supplied and the market prices shall be regulated. The prices can start coming down. Fourth six months – consolidation of programmed agricultural production mainly for export and import substitution, supported by regular exports of high quality agricultural produce to some selected markets from where, some of the most essential imports can be initiated on a barter system. That way, the local markets shall be well supplied and the market prices shall be regulated. The prices can start coming down. That way, Sri Lanka’s Recovery can become something realistic and achievable. By Ananda Ariyaratne"

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture.

According to the Ministry of Defence, the Chinese research vessel, Yuan Wang 5, was granted permission under the ‘freedom of navigation’ principle in the Indian Ocean. The Indian Administration is alarmed as such a vessel arrives at Hambantota Port with the permission of the Sri Lankan Government. Vessel assessment will not take place, as approval comes from the top, Ceylon Today learns. Also, the Indian Government is carefully monitoring the vessel’s movement in the Indian Ocean, a spokesperson for the Indian Government said last week. The Defence Ministry said the vessel has high capabilities of surveillance and sea wave research and the vessel is presently in Philippine waters. The ship is sailing from China directly to Hambantota Port before returning to China. Following its research in the North West of the Indian Ocean, it would return to Hambantota Port for replenishment, the Defence Ministry added. The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have officially granted approval for the high-tech surveillance vessel to be anchored at the Chinese-run Hambantota Port from 11 to 17 August. Harbour Master of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Captain Nirmal de Silva told Ceylon Today, “We have not been approached by any agent so far and what I learn is that the vessel would be here for replenishment during a research operation in the North West Indian Ocean during the months of August and September.” He said he would be informed in due course, as there is still time until 11 August, but has so far not been apprised about it.  “Research in international waters falls outside my purview. It’s up to them to decide which port to go to and obtain the clearance,” the Harbour Master said. By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan"
https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/08/03/first-capitol-rioter-to-face-trial-gets-7-years/,First Capitol rioter to face trial gets 7 years,Author not found,0,2022-08-02T21:00:00+00:00,"A federal judge Monday (01) sentenced Guy Wesley Reffitt, the first defendant to go on trial in the US Justice Department’s sprawling criminal inquiry into the 6 January attack, to more than seven years in prison, the longest sentence to date in a case stemming from the Capitol riot. After a six-hour hearing, Judge Dabney Friedrich handed down a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. She noted that was still significantly longer than any given so far to any of the more than 800 people arrested in connection with the riot, many of whom have struck plea bargains. Prosecutors had asked that Reffitt be given 15 years after adding a sentencing enhancement used in cases of domestic terrorism. But Friedrich rejected those terms, sentencing him to seven years and three months in prison with three years of probation, and ordering him to pay $2,000 in restitution and receive mental health treatment. A jury found Reffitt guilty on five felony charges in March, including obstructing Congress’ certification of the 2020 presidential election, carrying a .40-caliber pistol during the riot, and two counts of civil disorder. Unlike others who breached the building, Reffitt did not go inside. The sentencing capped a trial that was seen as an important test for the Justice Department, which is only beginning the marathon process of trying what could be scores of rioters. In particular, prosecutors and defense lawyers had been watching to see how the obstruction charge, a rarely used count central to many of the cases yet to reach trial, would hold up in court. But Friedrich described Reffitt’s case as unusual on account of threats of violence he made against his children when he discovered he might be swept up in the federal investigation following the riot. In March, Reffitt’s son, Jackson Reffitt, took the stand to testify that his father had become radicalised in the months leading up to the attack, and had threatened both him and his sister in an attempt to dissuade them from speaking to authorities, telling them that “traitors get shot.” Before Monday, the longest sentence in a case related to the attack on the Capitol was just more than five years, given last year to a man who had pleaded guilty to assaulting an officer with a fire extinguisher. But because Reffitt did not plead guilty like hundreds of others arrested in connection with the attack and went to trial, Friedrich said, the sentencing guidelines for his case were two years more than if he had reached a plea deal. The sentence comes as a parallel investigation being carried out by the House Jan. 6 committee has been gaining momentum. As courts slowly process the hundreds of cases related to the riot, speculation has grown as to how the Justice Department will respond to the committee’s findings about former President Donald Trump and those in his inner circle who helped instigate it, and whether the committee will formally recommend criminal charges.

The President said, there are 8 million doses of Covid vaccines in the country. “We can use them until the end of October. We might not be able to use them all. So, we would have to donate the rest of the doses to another country. Therefore, I urge every citizens to obtain the vaccine soon,” he said. “We should implement the methods through which the virus was brought under control in 2021,” A senior official for the Health Ministry said, yesterday (2), quoting Health Minister Rambukwella. He noted that the successful Covid vaccination programme implemented last year largely helped in curbing the virus spread of the Omicron Covid variant this year. The spokesperson said President Ranil Wickremesinghe had called for the health service to make Covid control a focal point. All attention should be given to prevent another spread of the corona in the island. “The Minister had also called for awareness programmes to be carried out for those who were going to see the Kandy ‘Esala Perahera’ this year. Also, the Minister instructed however that this awareness should be carried out in a manner which did not hinder the tourism industry,” he said. Rambukwella also called for the officials to formulate a programme in collaboration with the Education Ministry authorities in order to prevent Covid and dengue spreading amongst schoolchildren.  Meanwhile, the President also said the attention has been drawn with regard to monkeypox as well. “We have taken the first step to prevent the disease entering the country for now. Plans are being prepared to provide treatments if monkeypox cases are reported in Sri Lanka,” he said. BY Dilanthi Jayamanne"

https://ceylontoday.lk/2022/08/03/al-qaeda-leader-killed-in-taliban-stronghold-aymen-al-zawahiri-in-life-and-death/,Al Qaeda leader killed in Taliban stronghold: Aymen al Zawahiri in life and death,Author not found,0,2022-08-02T20:50:00+00:00," Within the community of Jihadists, Aymen al Zawahiri was the most influential terrorist leader when the US killed the al Qaeda leader on 31 July 2022. The fact that the incumbent leader of one of the world’s deadliest terrorist groups was living in Afghanistan at the time of his death demonstrated that the Taliban remained a state sponsor of terrorism. Both the Islamic State and al Qaeda are considered the world’s two most dangerous terrorist groups. More than any other group, al Qaeda influenced and shaped the contemporary Jihad movement including the Islamic State, the group that dominated the Iraqi-Syrian theatre and staged attacks worldwide. Before and after the return of the Taliban to Kabul on 15 August 2021, it’s leadership pledged that the Taliban will not offer safe haven to al Qaeda or any other groups. On 11 September 2001, when al Qaeda staged the world’s deadliest terrorist attack and killed 2,977 people on American soil, the Taliban too was the host of al Qaeda. Unless the Taliban, the ruling regime of Afghanistan is held accountable for hosting al Qaeda and it’s leadership, Afghanistan will remain a safe haven for the jihadist fraternity. When Zawahiri was killed, there was a bounty of USD 25 million on his head. Hailing from an influential family in Egypt, Zawahiri guided and directed threat groups worldwide. Wage global Jihad Until his death, Osama bin Laden was the symbolic leader of the contemporary Jihad groups, but it was Zawahiri that influenced him to wage global Jihad. As an ideologue and a theoretician, Zawahiri instigated and inspired not only al Qaeda but a dozen other groups including the Islamic State founder leader Abu Musab al Zarqawi, that later fell out with the al Qaeda leadership. Before moving to the Pakistan-Afghanistan theatre during the anti-Soviet multi-national mujahideen campaign in the 1980s, Zawahiri was the head of the Islamic Jihad, a terrorist group in Egypt. In Pakistan, where Zawahiri doubled up as a medical doctor, he rivalled with another ideologue and a theoretician, Abdullah Azzam. After Azzam was assassinated in 1988, Zawahiri served as both the physician and ideologue of Osama bin Laden. Zawahiri’s contribution to both the ideological and the operational formation of the contemporary wave of terrorism and violence is unmatched. In addition to radicalising the founder head of al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, he gave an ideology of continuous war and argued that the entire world was the theatre of war.  Zawahiri was also the mastermind of al Qaeda’s failed anthrax programme. In death as in life, the writings and speeches of Zawahiri will continue to influence the global community of jihadists and other threat entities.  References: The author of ‘Inside al Qaeda: Inside the Global Terrorist Network@ (Columbia University Press)’, Rohan Gunaratna is the editor of the ‘Handbook of Terrorism in the Middle East’ (World Scientific, Singapore 2022) By Rohan Gunaratna"

President of the Public Health Inspectors’ Union of Sri Lanka (PHIUSL), Upul Rohana said, there were difficulties in testing suspected Covid-19 cases due to a shortage of antigen kits in Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas. There is a build-up of Covid-19 cases in several countries including India, Vietnam, and Europe. But at present, Sri Lanka is unable to test suspected cases that have been detected in all parts of the country due to the lack of antigen testing kits. “We have not seen the last of the Coronavirus. Sri Lanka is quite likely to see an outbreak of Covid-19 cases within the next two weeks,” he lamented. “The situation would worsen as control work is severely compromised by the fuel and economic crises facing the country. Immunity has been compromised, those suffering from comorbidities and the elderly are highly vulnerable,” the PHIUSL President said. “The health service would be in a dilemma with the economic crisis leading to drug shortages and fuel issues to provide even proper ambulance services for patients with severe symptoms of the viral infection,” he said. The public could assist by adhering to strict health guidelines while queuing for gas and fuel and while using crowded public transport services, Rohana said. He also urged the public to take the booster doses of the Covid vaccine as early as possible in a bid to control and prevent another wave.  By Dilanthi Jayamanne"

Wickramaratne to transfer SSP Romesh Liyanage attached to the STF out of Colombo until the conclusion of Police investigations into the assault on the media personnel of a private television channel on 9 July. HRCSL said the Police Special Investigation Unit (SIU) is presently investigating the incident and as this has to be independent and impartial, such transfer is essential. It was stated that investigations into the incident revealed that SSP Liyanage was the Unit Commander deployed for security at and near the private residence of President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the said day, with over 140 STF personnel under his Command. “It is also not in doubt that the media personnel posed no threat to the Police on that day and the assault on the media was unjustified and intentional after being identified as media personnel by the STF and Police,” HRCSL observed, adding that these officers were under the direct command of SSP Liyanage. SSP Liyanage denied being present at the time of the assault and denied any knowledge of the assault on the media personnel when he was shown a video which was submitted as footage of the particular event, HRCSL said, adding that there is a serious doubt regarding the credibility of the evidence given by SSP Liyanage to the HRCSL under oath. “He is unequivocally responsible for the attack on the media personnel on this day. This is a gross violation of the people’s fundamental rights and, importantly, of the rights of the free media, which is an integral part of every democracy. This irresponsible behaviour from the high ranks of Law enforcement officials is severe, detrimental, and dangerous for the safety of a just society,” a statement issued by HRCSL said. “The Officer handling the disciplinary inquiry informed that the perpetrators are yet to be identified, and identifying them in the present uniform is not an easy task and one of the major setbacks is the identity of the assailant for the Police investigation, therefore, the HRCSL recommends to the IGP that the camouflage uniform in the present description is not the proper uniform for civil operations,” the statement read, noting that the IGP must take cognisance of the uniform presently worn by the STF for civilian operations and take appropriate action to have a proper uniform, especially for civic duty. HRCSL further summoned the Commandant of the Special Task Force (STF), DIG Waruna Jayasundera, SSP Liyanage, and SSP D.S.

NCE in a statement noted that there has to be system to funnel export remittances to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) so it can make allocations for imports through the banking system and that the NCE is committed to support authorities engender change in rebuilding the economy through exports.  The NCE stated that the recent statement by the CBSL alleging exporters of not remitting full export proceeds has raised concerns. “The Statement by the CBSL clearly accused exporters for not remitting export proceeds earned overseas, denying the country much needed foreign currency, during this unprecedented economic meltdown. Under the Repatriation of Export Proceeds into Sri Lanka Rules No. 05 of 2021, published by a gazette notice, the CBSL enforced exporters to remit foreign exchange earnings and convert to Sri Lankan rupees, except for allowed payments,” they said. The statement further noted that in this regard, the figures provided by CBSL ought to be thoroughly investigated and action taken as per prevailing laws and regulations.  They said it is the task by CBSL to monitor repatriation and conversion of export proceeds to the country with the support of a robust system and to penalise those who do not conform to such formalities. “Exporters have registered export invoices with CBSL through CUSDEC.  As per ruling by CBSL, they have to remit the full export proceedings to Sri Lanka within 180 days, resulting a penalty if the stipulated days have been exceeded. However, if such delays were due to genuine reasons of not accepting goods on time, CBSL has recalled the penalties imposed. Yet, the CBSL should have a mechanism to check the time difference between filing the custom declaration and remittance of export proceeds, making a note that exporters are permitted to 180 days’ credit. In a practical world, export proceedings of the previous month will be affected anytime between one to 25 weeks,” it said.  In this case, the NCE requests CBSL to provide source verification of figures provided, noting that when Sri Lanka Customs reflects export figures each month, it should be matched against the approved credit period for repatriation of export proceeds. Adding further, the NCE stated that CBSL being the apex body of managing the fiscal condition of the country, ought to play a massive role in stabilising the country’s economy. Simply by highlighting long years of malpractice by exporters of not remitting forex earnings, is only showcasing the ineffective governance of this highest state authority. “We are surprised to hear that even a year ago as stated by CBSL, Sri Lanka Customs has reported USD 985 Million worth exports during the eight months from January to August 2021. During July/August that year, exporters have repatriated an average of USD 640 million a month,” a senior NCE official stated. According to the Chamber, they have discussed this matter with their members and has emphasised the importance of following the rules of CBSL related to Forex remittance especially during this crisis and that Sri Lankan exporters are duty bound to do so. "

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S.

He said, the Cabinet approved the draft 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. Accordingly, the amendment will be tabled in Parliament soon. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution, he said, gave the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition the authority to appoint three Members of Parliament to the Constitutional Council. However, with the new amendment, the Speaker will oversee such appointments, and the three MPs will represent the main ruling party, the main opposition party, and minor parties in Parliament. According to Rajapakshe, the new amendment is more progressive than the 19th Constitutional Amendment. According to the current law, the President can appoint the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka without consulting any faction, and the clause was not amended even through the 19th Amendment, according to Dr. Rajapakshe. However, he noted that with the passage of the 22nd Constitutional Amendment, the President will be required to consult with the Constitutional Council before appointing the Central Bank Governor. “The President was able to hold three Ministries following the 19th Amendment, but the provision was removed following the last election. However, the new Constitutional Amendment includes a provision requiring the President to hold the Defence Ministry portfolio. At the moment, the general public has only seven days to challenge any Bill in the Supreme Court for violating the Constitution. Following the enhancement of the 22nd Constitutional Amendment, the public will have 14 days to challenge any bill in the Supreme Court,” he said. He also said the government intends to introduce a separate anti-corruption bill.

I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, it’s how fast we can get to it,” Wickremesinghe said.
