The Court also instructed the convict to pay a sum of three million rupees as compensation to the mother of the victim, Fathima Ayesha of Atulugama and warned that failure to pay the compensation would result in a further six and a half years of imprisonment. The Court sentenced the convict, having considered the indictments filed against him by the Attorney General. The convict was identified as Farook Ganeshanathan who had been a friend of the victim’s father. Deputy Solicitor General Janaka Bandara along with Senior State Counsel Lakshman Perera, who prosecuted, stated that the actions resorted to by the accused had further underscored the viciousness of the present day society. They therefore urged the Court to impose the severest possible penalties and fines on the accused so as to deter others from committing similar offences. The lawyers said that they hoped the High Court would not let off the accused lightly as he is a known to be hardcore criminal. Taking the submissions of the DSG and the Senior State Counsel into perusal, Judge Kumara slapped the aforementioned punishments and fines on the convict. The Bandaragama Police and the Panadura Division Special Crimes Unit, probing the incident, had uncovered that the convict had coaxed the victim to go with him to a nearby shrub jungle with the intention of raping her after she had gone to a boutique, situated close to her house, on 27 May two years ago. The Police had uncovered that though the convict had attempted to rape the deceased he had been prevented from doing so due to loud screaming on the part of the victim and afterwards the convict had submerged the victim in a nearby muddy paddy field causing her death. During the probe the Police had also gathered information that the convict, who had been a close friend of her father, had been known to her family having visited them often and therefore she had willingly gone with him on the ill-fated day. After the Police had identified the accused, the Attorney General had filed indictments against him, before the High Court, in a short span of time."

Initially, officials from the agriculture, irrigation and Mahaweli sectors, aired their views on planning for the upcoming season. Subsequently, the emcee of the event invited Minister Amaraweera to speak. However, just as he was about to commence his speech, representatives from farmer unions stood up and protested against the Minister. They expressed their frustration, stating that they had not travelled from far-flung areas to listen to the Minister’s views. The farmers’ union representatives demanded to be allowed to air their grievances before the Minister’s speech. Minister Amaraweera consented to stay back and listen to the farmers’ grievances, explaining that he had intended to speak first to break the ice. The farmer union representatives questioned why a national agriculture policy was not in place, expressing concerns that farmers were being controlled by businessmen due to this shortfall.  Minister Amaraweera explained that during his tenure as the subject Minister, six years ago, he had initiated a national agriculture policy, which was examined by a committee led by Prof. Gamini Seneviratne. He noted that the policy proposal suggested incorporating sectors such as fisheries, irrigation and livestock, which would take some time to compile. The farmer representatives insisted that the views of farmers should be included in the final draft of the policy. Minister Amaraweera suggested that the farmers’ suggestions could be submitted to Parliament as future amendments. The farmer union representatives alleged that they were not receiving reasonable prices for their harvests during the ongoing Maha Season. They also complained about the skyrocketing prices of agricultural equipment and pesticides, demanding government intervention and relief. They questioned how officials and traders could decide the price of their harvest after they had worked hard in the fields. Additionally, they requested the presence of officials responsible for deciding the prices of paddy at the meeting. Furthermore, they highlighted damages caused to their crops by wild animals and sought both short and long-term relief measures. Minister Wanniarachchi expressed her disapproval of the farmer union representatives making baseless allegations against Minister Amaraweera, emphasising his efforts to revive the agrarian industry, even within the Cabinet. She noted that Minister Amaraweera had worked diligently to obtain the maximum price for paddy on numerous occasions."

To address this, the Cabinet approved the proposal to engage with experts in the field further and incorporate their proposed amendments into the draft bill for the Online Safety Act."

All of them were appointed to the board by former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella.  In his letter of resignation addressed to the Minister of Health, Gamage noted that his intention to step down from his position in the NMRA was effective 13 February.  In his letter, Gamage stressed that he had endeavoured to work for the betterment of the Authority in his capacity as a lawyer. While serving as a Director, he said he had done his maximum to make appropriate decisions to overcome some of the failures in the Authority. They included completing and submitting annual reports which had not been provided from 2016 to 2022. Completing all work related to the Corporate Plan of the NMRA and establishing audit committees and conducting audit committee meetings as the former administrations of NMRA had failed to do so.   The former NMRA Director said he had also been instrumental in the recruitment and induction of pharmacists which had not been done for the past eight years.  Gamage’s loyalties and ethics were questioned in December last year when he spoke in defence of former Health Minister Rambukwella, who was accused of being involved in the procurement of a large quantity of low-quality medicinal drugs including the Human Immunoglobulin IV scandal.       "

Routine surgeries and clinical services were also disrupted as a result of the strike. State service hospital administrations had requested for assistance from the Armed forces. Thereby they were deployed to run daily activities of the hospitals affected by the strike. Security Forces maintained the services of Health Assistants in the National Hospitals Colombo and Kandy, National Eye Hospital, Colombo, Teaching Hospitals  Kalubowila, Karapitiya, Mahamodara, Peradeniya, Anuradhapura and Kurunegala and the services at,  Matale, Polonnaruwa, Medirigiriya, Higurakgoda, Batticaloa, Dehiattakandiya , Hambantota, Debarawewa, Ratnapura, Balangoda, Aheliyagoda, Nawalapitiya, Badulla, Elpitiya, Homagama and Kegalle. About 900 troops of the Sri Lanka Army were put on duty at hospitals. Media Committee Member of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA warned the trade union leaders, who are up in arms, to refrain from verbally attacking medical practitioners and as a result creating disharmony between health service employees. “We would have to resort to trade union action if these warring trade union leaders do not stop their spiteful verbal attacks targeting doctors.” He said his outfit would decide on a course of action when the Central Committee of the GMOA meets during the course of the week.   “It is not legally or constitutionally possible to give a Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) increase of Rs 35,000 to non-medical health service employees as the particular allowance is exclusively for the medical fraternity. Instead these trade unions should agitate and demand for allowances relevant to their profession,” he said.  Convenor of the Health Service Trade Union Alliance  (HSTUA) Chanaka Dharmawickrema said that although only one of the three nurses’ unions, namely the Government Nursing Officers’ Association (GNOA) had  joined the strike nearly 20,000 nurses (50% of the total number)  had supported the cause.  The All Ceylon Nurses Union (ACNU) is scheduled to stage a protest today (14) demanding for much needed economic justice by increasing allowances and paying them the ‘Sleepless, Transport and Risk’ Allowance (STR) and awarding the proper title for Nursing Sisters who had completed a Post Graduate Course."

Additionally, he noted that a national media policy has been drafted and is presently being considered by the Cabinet for approval. State Minister Bandara was speaking at a news conference held at the President’s Media Centre yesterday (13). The State Minister also said: “In tackling today’s prominent challenge of financial management, we directed our attention towards addressing revenue and expenditure issues. Specifically, we concentrated on the 16 institutions falling under the Ministry, a significant portion of which relied on Treasury allocations. As a result, initiatives were undertaken to enhance the self-sufficiency of these entities, enabling them to operate independently. Particularly, in our efforts to enhance Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation and the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, we engaged in discussions with their management, leading to crucial decisions that have garnered positive responses. Further, Independent Television Network and the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (Lakehouse) have undergone significant transformations. We anticipate turning these institutions into profitable entities by next year.” Moreover, the Postal Department’s revenue projection saw a notable increase from Rs 9,268 million in 2022 to Rs 13,616 million in 2023. Through improved services and enhanced management practices without imposing additional burdens on the public, we managed to reduce the department’s losses from Rs 7,173 million in 2021 to Rs 6,832 million in 2022, and further down to Rs 3,222 million in 2023. We are confident that by 31 December 2024, the Postal Department will operate as a self-sustaining, profit-making institution independent of Treasury funds. Additionally, Cabinet has approved a special project programme worth Rs 10 billion, establishing a joint venture between the private and public sectors. This initiative aims to expedite international goods exchange processes. Further, plans are underway to launch a courier service for goods exchange in the Western Province this year, utilising 200 three-wheelers and 50 motorcycles, the State Minister added.  (SRM)"

Responsibility for overseeing the electoral process lies with the Election Commission, and the government will maintain communication with the Commission as and when necessary, the PMD added.  However, the PDM did not divulge any information about holding the indefinitely postponed local government elections and Provincial Council elections.  The PMD’s statement came amidst the allegations by several parties, including the main Opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) that there is an attempt to postpone the Presidential Election by bringing proposals to abolish the Executive Presidency.  The tenure of the President, elected in November 2019, ends in November 2024. As per the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the term of five years for an elected President does not change even if a President steps down during the period and another person takes over. Therefore, the election must be held one month before the conclusion of the incumbent President’s term. The Election Commission of Sri Lanka is responsible for holding the Presidential Election during the stipulated period as per the law."

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/14/ports-ministry-says-harins-statement-not-true/,Ports Ministry says Harin’s statement ‘NOT TRUE’,By Sulochana Ramiah Mohan,0,2024-02-13T20:36:00+00:00,"The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation has categorically stated that there is no truth to the claims made by Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando, during the Mumbai tourism roadshow, that an Indian investor might take control of the three main airports in Sri Lanka, including the BIA. The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He was also selected as the best Grama Seva Officer of the Galle District Promotion Awards Festival 2023. Speaking on his achievement he stated “I assumed my post in this Division on 1 January, 2023. The Karandeniya Divisional Secretariat is mostly made up of low-income groups. At the time I came here this place had gone to rack and ruin. However, since taking over duties I managed to set up an office within  two-months. I even held a lantern competition to mark last year’s Poson Festival. The biggest achievement is I was able to establish a small food bank within my office premises. This food bank consists of essential items for the public and if certain families are in need of such items, it could cater to their needs via this food bank.  Not only that, I have also created a medicinal and vegetable bank as well to look into the needs of these low-income families. Besides all this I have also been operating a children’s society and a relief society to cater to these people in this Secretariat”.

Officials pointed out that awareness programmes have commenced at provincial level and in the western and north-western provinces.  They further pointed out that although people were concerned about various directions based on various occult sciences, they were not concerned about the direction of the sun when building a house. They also said this situation raised concerns in the installation of solar panels. The committee pointed out the need to inform the public about this situation and encourage the people to install solar panels. Further, attention was paid to encourage the use of LED light bulbs to reduce electricity consumption. The officials pointed out that with the intervention of Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority, it was possible to reduce the price of LED bulbs and popularise them among the people. It was pointed out that by considering the reduction in electricity bills by the use of LED bulbs, the amount spent even by giving LED bulbs for free could be earned in two months. The Committee was of the view that attention must be paid in this regard. In addition, the Annual Report of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority for 2020 was also approved.

He said that it is proof of the government’s commitment towards the development of the people. The Prime Minister underlined FinTech connectivity will further strengthen cross-border transactions and connections. “India’s UPI or United Payments Interface comes in a new role today – Uniting Partners with India,” he stressed.   Referring to the Vision Document that was adopted during the last visit of the Sri Lankan President, Modi highlighted the strengthening financial connectivity as its key component.

People of Indian origin living in Sri Lanka and Mauritius and students studying there will also get special benefits from it,” the Prime Minister added. He also said the launch symbolises the success of Global South cooperation. “Our relations are not just about transactions, it is a historical relation,” PM Modi emphasised highlighting the strength of people-to-people relations between the three nations.  Drawing attention to India supporting its neighbouring friends in the last ten years, the Prime Minister said that India stands with its friends in every hour of crisis, be it natural disasters, health-related issues, economic or support on the international stage. “India has been the first responder and will continue to be so,” Modi said highlighting the special attention towards the concerns of the Global South even during India’s G20 presidency.  "

The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

President MCPA, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa yesterday (12) noted that the Health Ministry’s responsibility for the stock of imported pharmaceuticals should not be underestimated.  A large stock of medicinal drug imported through foreign suppliers, following accurate procurement procedures by the SPC, were lying in container terminals in Kelaniya, Welisara and Wattala. The Medicines were imported by the SPC in keeping with the procurement requests of the Health Ministry. Therefore, the Corporation is responsible for supplying the drugs from the moment they arrive in Sri Lanka to the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) while the latter should not forget its accountability for absorbing those medicines to the country’s health system as soon as possible.  Dr. Sanjeewa observed that the MSD should take urgent steps to reveal as to why the medicines were languishing in container terminals for about four months instead of being absorbed into the State health service. Also, a separate probe should be carried out to find if malpractices had occurred during the procurement process of those drugs. Also, relevant officials should be brought before the law if such malpractices had occurred, he said.   The MCPA President Further noted that the MSD was currently sans a permanent DDG to spear head it while the appointment of the Director of Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children (LRH) as its ‘Acting DDG’ was not a feasible solution to the issue.    Dr. Sanjeewa said that Health Minister, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana should take urgent steps to remove all health officials who served under former Health Minister, Keheliya Rambukwella and appoint a new one in order to rebuild public trust in the state health system. Steps should be taken to remove officials appointed by the former Health Minister including the incumbent Director General of Health Services."

Prior to 2015 the cosmetics were regulated under the Cosmetics, Devices and Drugs Act, No.27 (CDD Act). However, with the National Medicines Regulatory Act No.5 of 2015 being enacted in 2015, the CDD Act was abolished.  He noted however, that the NMRA had identified the urgent necessity to regulate the cosmetic products entering the local market. These products did not even fall into the borderline category. Hence, the Authority took measures to utilise the provisions given in the CDD Act.  Without even a proper place to register the cosmetics coming into the country, one cannot just utilise provisions of an act which has been abolished, he noted.  The GMOA Media Committee Member noted that the number of complaints reaching his outfit’s members, while serving in their respective hospitals and the number of cases coming to government hospitals with side effects – mostly from amongst the young, were increasing.  A sizable number of the products were harmful whitening creams and cosmetics which are not registered with any particular authority and had harmful effects which could cause allergies and even death to users.   Dr. Wijesinghe said that the situation was such that there were allegedly cosmetologists who allegedly specialise in the field of cosmetics when even the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) did not offer such specialised programmes. Some of them possess health background while there are none – health personnel who also practice as ‘Cosmetologists. These are quacks, he said.   "

The Judge stated that the prosecution, was continuing to lead the evidence against the defendants, in a roundabout way, rather than getting to the point straightway and that he has no other option, but to reveal it, unfortunately. Accordingly Judge Patabendige, advised the prosecution to examine the case files well and lead the evidence, afterwards. He also stated that it was also the duty of the Prosecution, to justify to Court, if the second defendant (Private Secretary), had paid an additional sum for fuel and if how much and for how long. The Judge stated this, having suspended the hearing of evidence and deferred further hearing of the trial to 17 March.

Responding to a query, Herath explained, “The main focus of our discussions centred on regional security, particularly in South Asia. We deliberated on various geopolitical threats that could potentially undermine regional stability. We assured our Indian counterparts that we are committed to safeguarding regional security while upholding our nation’s sovereignty. It’s imperative to note that our national security measures inherently contribute to regional security.” Regarding diplomatic relations with China, Herath clarified that India did not impose any restrictions or directives on maintaining ties with China. He emphasised that such matters are not pertinent to the NPP’s stance. When asked if the discussions with India would impact the NPP’s relations with China, Herath underscored that the party has a history of engaging with both India and China. He reaffirmed the NPP’s consistent stance on maintaining connections with various countries while safeguarding the national interest. For instance, he highlighted the NPP’s opposition to the previous government’s decision to lease the Hambantota Port to China, emphasising that their political stance remains unwavering regardless of discussions held with India or China. Herath said the trip was not an impromptu one but had in response to an invitation received last December. However, due to their tight, they had postponed it until February, ultimately reducing the visit from the initially planned ten days to five. He explained that India had initially extended a ten-day invitation, but the NPP opted to curtail it due to their prior commitments and internal party activities. He highlighted that this wasn’t the NPP’s maiden diplomatic invitation, citing a previous visit by NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and a delegation to China, albeit with less publicity compared to the latest India visit. Herath speculated that the significance accorded to the Indian visit stems from the party’s prior stances on Indian affairs. “There has been much speculation surrounding this visit. However, it’s important to emphasise that we, as a political faction, possess a comprehensive understanding of the present geopolitics. Therefore, we do not pay heed to such speculations. Our visit to India is aimed at serving the interests of the public. The geopolitical landscape has evolved significantly since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Today, there exist various influential factions such as the United States, China, India, the European Union, and Latin America, among others. In the 1980s, Sri Lanka experienced direct interference from India. Many are aware of the attempted Indian military intervention and the Indo-Lanka Agreement. We vehemently opposed such efforts to safeguard our sovereignty. However, the political landscape has undergone significant change since then. Presently, our country faces economic challenges, and it is imperative that we rebuild both economically and politically with a clear vision.” Responding to queries regarding any assurances or support from India for future elections, Herath categorically stated that no such discussions had taken place, emphasising that countries endorse democratically elected governments rather than political parties vying for power. Regarding the NPP’s stance on Indian investors like Adani and Amul, Herath said their protest centered around the selection of investors through unsolicited proposals. He reiterated that an NPP administration would welcome investors from any nation but stressed the importance of transparent investment processes and adherence to due tender procedures. Reflecting on the visit’s outcomes, Herath deemed it successful and hinted at implementing several lessons learnt from the trip should an NPP government come to power."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

He also exuded confidence about his chances of securing re-election in the upcoming Presidential Polls.  The interview, conducted during Wickremesinghe’s participation at the 7th Indian Ocean Conference in Perth, Australia, also saw him address growing concerns regarding China’s expanding influence in the region. Wickremesinghe expressed optimism about facing the electoral challenge, highlighting his commitment to addressing the nation’s ongoing economic and political turmoil. However, his most significant remarks came on the topic of China’s presence in the Indian Ocean. Recognising the importance of Sri Lanka’s relationship with India, Wickremesinghe offered strong assurances that his nation wouldn’t tolerate any activities detrimental to India’s security.  He emphasised, “We’ve kept Indian security in mind and we will not allow anything to happen that will be harmful to Indian security.” Further clarifying Sri Lanka’s recent decision to deny entry to Chinese vessels, Wickremesinghe explained that the move was based on the Government’s strategic focus on building its own hydrographic capabilities. He stressed that the decision wasn’t specifically targeted at China and that visits by naval vessels would still be permitted. This explanation aims to ease tensions and maintain cordial relations with both India and China, key players in the regional geopolitical landscape.  Following are excerpts of the interview: WION: And moving forward to the domestic aspects of your country. Elections (are) happening this year. Wickremesinghe: Yes, both presidential and parliamentary. WION: And, how optimistic are you that hopefully you will (be) back. Wickremesinghe: For me to be back, I must contest. WION: And do you plan to sir? Wickremesinghe: I have come here to put the economy (right). My first duty is to focus on that. We (need to) get out of bankruptcy. WION: And do you think you’ve done a good job? I mean, what’s your view about the economy in terms of your tenure because you ultimately were the face of the crisis in terms of the emergence of Sri Lanka (back to normalcy)? Wickremesinghe: Well, I’m quite satisfied. I feel we will be able to do this. WION: You will be able to do this. Another thing is the implementation of the 13th Amendment, something that India has also been talking about. What’s the way forward? Wickremesinghe: (We will) hold the Provincial Council Election next year. As I announced in my speech, when I opened Parliament, we want to give each province its own economy. So, like in India, economies will compete with each other, which is to benefit, or to be very, very competitive economies. And those provinces should handle their economic and social development within the National Policy Framework. In this respect, we said we are prepared to give the concurrent powers, most of it, or whatever is required, whatever they want, to the provincial councils, so that we are moving on. There has been a request by some of the groups for minority groups (in) our Senate. So, as far as we are concerned, we will not oppose it, but it’s a matter for all parties to agree to, not merely the Government, and there are so many parties in Parliament at present.  (MD)"

The decision, as conveyed by the President’s Media Division (PMD), aims to ease the financial burden on underprivileged parents and prioritise the welfare of children, recognising their significance for the nation’s future. Acknowledging the significant expenses involved in pre and post-tests and treatments for liver transplant surgeries in children under 16 years old at the North Colombo General Hospital (Ragama Teaching Hospital), President Wickremesinghe has approved Rs 1 million from the President’s Fund for each liver transplant surgery meeting specified criteria. This financial support will take effect from 1 January 2024, intending to relieve families undergoing these critical medical procedures from financial stress, according to the PMD. President Wickremesinghe’s directive underscores the government’s dedication to providing essential medical care for children in need, particularly those facing life-threatening conditions requiring specialized surgeries. By utilising the President’s Fund to facilitate these surgeries, the Gaims to ensure that financial constraints do not hinder access to crucial healthcare services for young patients, thus safeguarding their health and future well-being. It has been observed through medical assessments that over 200 children in Sri Lanka are in need of cochlear implant surgery, essential for their auditory development. While such surgeries are promptly conducted at birth upon identification of the need in developed countries, in Sri Lanka, not all eligible children undergo this procedure due to financial constraints. Medical experts stress the importance of performing such operations within two years from birth for optimal brain development. However, the estimated cost, exceeding Rs. 5 million, poses a significant barrier. Presently, this surgery is only available at a few government hospitals, resulting in waiting lists for affected children. The cochlear implant surgery is performed at the Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital, with the implant device valued at approximately Rs. 3-4 million. While the Ministry of Health provides the device to the hospital free of charge, patients are required to cover the surgery costs, amounting to Rs 600,000. Recognising the financial burden, the Ministry of Health has procured the necessary cochlear implant devices. Additionally, the surgery costs, totaling Rs 600,000, will be covered by the President’s Fund. Consequently, the government will bear the expenses associated with these surgeries, conducted at the Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital. The decision to provide financial aid from the President’s Fund for cochlear implant surgeries for these children is not only a societal benefit but also eases the strain on the healthcare system. Despite the substantial financial investment required, it must be understood that supporting these surgeries for young children is an investment in the nation’s future. As a result, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has authorised financial assistance from the President’s Fund, effective 1 January 2024, with a maximum amount of Rs 600,000 for cochlear implant surgeries conducted on children at the Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital."

The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts.

He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai.

Stalin expressed concerns about the increase in attacks on members of the State’s fishing community in the region and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and resolve the issue at the earliest, Indian media reported.  In his letter to Prime Minister Modi, Chief Minister Stalin stated, “I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the alarming increase in incidents of apprehension of Tamil fishermen and their boats by the Sri Lankan authorities. This issue severely impacts the right to livelihood of these fishermen, as the communities have utilised these fishing waters for generations.” CM Stalin urged Prime Minister Modi to renew the Joint Action Group to resolve fishermen’s issues. He also highlighted a ‘significant increase’ in the number of fishermen being arrested. “The traditional fishing waters that Tamil fishermen have relied upon for generations are getting increasingly restricted, making it difficult to sustain their livelihood impacting the economic stability of these communities. This also threatens the cultural and social fabric of the region that revolves around the fishing industry. During 2023, the Sri Lankan Navy arrested 243 fishermen and seized 37 boats. However, in the past 28 days alone, 88 fishermen and 12 boats were apprehended in six incidents,” CM Stalin wrote. He mentioned that a legislation recently passed in Sri Lanka allows the country to nationalise the seized boats, which could drive members of the State’s fishing community into penury. “I had previously addressed you regarding the amendment made to the Fisheries Act by the Government of Sri Lanka in 2018, which enables the Sri Lankan Government to nationalise foreign fishing vessels. Due to this action of Sri Lanka, the seized fishing boats of our fishermen that are in good condition cannot be salvaged and brought back to Tamil Nadu. Many fishermen have invested their life savings in acquiring and maintaining their boats, which are vital for their trade,” he wrote while urging the Sri Lankan government to make necessary amendments to the law. CM Stalin also requested Prime Minister Modi to ensure that “all-out diplomatic efforts should be made to secure the release of 77 fishermen and their 151 boats from Sri Lanka”. "

This day was designated by the United Nations General Assembly on 12 June 2023. The resolution, titled ‘International Arabian Leopard Day’, was proposed by Saudi Arabia and supported by over 30 countries. Its objective is to raise awareness about the endangered status of the Arabian leopard, among other big cat species like lions, tigers, jaguars and cheetahs. The resolution emphasises the importance of wildlife preservation and biodiversity conservation. The event featured a stroll along Galle Face Beach, showcasing Colombo’s tourist attractions. Several senior ministers, government officials, heads of Arab countries’ missions accredited to Sri Lanka, prominent media personalities, embassy staff and their families participated in the event. The Arabian leopard (Panthera pardus nimr) is a critically endangered leopard subspecies that inhabits the Arabian Peninsula. It is one of the smallest leopard subspecies, with an average weight of 30-40 kg for males and 25-35 kg for females. Its fur is pale and buff-colored with rosettes that are small and closely spaced. The Arabian leopard has a very limited distribution, being found only in a few isolated pockets of habitat in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Yemen and the United Arab Emirates. Estimates suggest there may be fewer than 200 Arabian leopards left in the wild. Threats to the species include urbanisation, farming, overgrazing by livestock, poaching, and the illegal wildlife trade. Conservation efforts focus on habitat protection, restoration of natural prey populations, and public education programmes to reduce human-leopard conflict. The Arabian leopard is legally protected across its range, but greater enforcement of laws and active management of surviving populations are needed to ensure the species’ survival."

The analysis, featured on PublicFinance.lk, a platform for economic insights in Sri Lanka, was conducted by Verité Research. It examined the electricity charges for households consuming 100, 200 or 300 units at the beginning of 2024, focusing solely on supplier rates and excluding government taxes like the Social Security Levy in Sri Lanka. Comparatively, the second-highest household electricity costs in the region are found in Pakistan, although they remain considerably lower than those of Sri Lanka. For instance, households consuming 100 units face charges that are 50 per cent higher in Sri Lanka than in Pakistan, while those consuming 300 units are confronted with rates that are 97 per cent higher in Sri Lanka. The surge in Sri Lanka’s electricity charges follows a commitment made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, wherein the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) pledged to recoup its full costs through a combination of consumer charges and subsidies from the Treasury. Despite a slated tariff reduction this month (February 2024) is expected to decrease electricity charges by four per cent or less, the impact is deemed inconsequential. Consequently, Sri Lankan households are poised to persist as the region’s highest payers for electricity by a significant margin."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture.

https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/02/09/book-industry-makes-clarion-call-for-vat-exemption/,Book Industry Makes Clarion Call for VAT Exemption,Author not found,0,2024-02-08T20:32:00+00:00,"The latest salvo against the government’s imposition of value-added tax (VAT) on hitherto exempted sectors came on 2 February, from Sri Lanka’s book industry, which called for an immediate reversal of the decision to tax the sale of books at 18 per cent. Associations representing local publishers, printers, booksellers, importers, writers and academics came together to voice their opposition to the unavoidable hike in the prices of books consequent to the imposition of VAT, pointing to the pernicious long-term effects it would have on socio-economic development by making access to knowledge unaffordable to many. “We acknowledge that economic challenges spanning multiple government terms have led to a situation where the broader population has been required to shoulder the financial implications of the gradual national recovery,” the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Book Publishers’ Association (SLBPA), Dinesh Kulatunga told the media at a news conference. “But, is it fair that this short-term requirement to boost government revenue should have the longer-term destructive consequence of retarding the education, culture, intellectual progress and personal development of generations of Sri Lankans, and negatively impact the development of the knowledge economy?” he queried. Speakers representing different stakeholder groups in the book industry also charged that with the indiscriminate extension of VAT to a highly sensitive and vulnerable sector like books, Sri Lanka was also in violation of the UNESCO Florence Agreement of 1950, to which the country was an early signatory and continues to be a Contracting State. The UNESCO Florence Agreement is a treaty that binds Contracting States to not impose customs duties and taxes on certain educational, scientific and cultural materials that are imported. “With the imposition of VAT on books, Sri Lanka attains the dubious distinction of becoming one of a very few countries that impose a tax on a vital source of knowledge and information,” the President of the Sri Lanka Book Publishers’ Association, Samantha Indeewara said. “What this means is that while the rest of the world is trying to make knowledge more accessible and inclusive at the grassroots level, Sri Lanka is trying to use this industry to raise government revenue, heedless of the serious ramifications.” “It is a textbook case of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.” “According to the International Book Publishers Association, books are not a commodity like any other, but are strategic assets that activate the knowledge economy, facilitate upward social mobility as well as personal growth, and bring widespread medium and long term social, cultural and economic benefits.” It was also pointed out that the industry already contributes upwards of Rs 1 billion to the government’s tax revenue via the VAT paid by importers that supply 90 per cent of the raw materials used in the production of school textbooks and other books. The imposition of VAT on books therefore, results in an anomaly of double taxation for publishers, further aggravating a difficult situation. The government’s decision to impose 18 per cent VAT on books has already generated concern internationally, with the International Publishers Association (IPA) and the European and International Booksellers Federation (EIBF) writing to President Ranil Wickremesinghe to voice their objections. “Our member associations are united and have made efforts to engage with your office to explain the catastrophic consequences that such a tariff will have on the country’s book sector,” the two organisations said on 15 December 2023. “We stand in solidarity with Sri Lankan publishers and booksellers, and urge you to reconsider this measure for the benefit of the Sri Lankan literary landscape.” Among the Sri Lankan organisations and personalities that attended the news conference to call for the restoration of the VAT exemption on books were the Sri Lanka Book Publishers’ Association (SLBPA), the Sri Lanka Book Importers and Exporters Association, the Sri Lanka Writers Association and several leading writers, academics, educationists and author-publishers."

However, due to some practical issues that arose during the implementation of that step, it took time to settle the deal. In particular, the Sri Lankan Government even had to pay a compensation of USD 6.9 million on the charge of damaging the reputation of the Chinese company that supplied the relevant organic fertilisers. Although it was decided to get other fertiliser and agricultural equipment to meet this amount, it was difficult to get another product suitable for agricultural needs because the same organic fertiliser is produced by the company concerned. The Cabinet of Ministers decided on 13 September 2022 to request the Minister of Foreign Affairs to come to a friendly agreement between China and Sri Lanka after discussing with all the relevant parties and submit the most appropriate proposals to the Cabinet to resolve this issue. On 7 February, a discussion was held at the Ministry of Agriculture under the patronage of Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera to find a solution to the problematic situation caused by this organic fertiliser transaction. A group of officials including Janaka Dharmakeerthi, Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries participated in that event. On the same day, the Ministry of Agriculture decided to take some more steps to resolve this issue. Thus, he decided to discuss this matter with the delegation including Ma Youxiang, Vice Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, which will participate in the 37th Session of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific (APRC) to be held in Sri Lanka from 19-22 February. It was decided to discuss the resolution of the issues that arose during the implementation of the Court settlement between the Chinese Organic Fertiliser Company and the two State fertiliser companies in a manner that does not damage the friendly relations between the two countries as well as for the benefit of Sri Lankan farmers. The Minister of Agriculture instructed the Secretary of the Ministry to take steps to invite the relevant officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Sabry, PC, to this discussion. Further, the Minister informed the officials that he and other officials are expected to discuss this issue with the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the Chinese Government, who is due in the country shortly."

A senior spokesman for the Health Ministry, yesterday (8) said, the programme is aimed at providing the necessary primary care treatment, before referring patients, who are in serious condition, for emergency treatment to hospitals with more facilities, by utilising modern technology.  The Health Ministry would implement the new programme as a project in the primary care hospitals. The hot line 070 500 0450 was introduced in this connection. An awareness programme was conducted for district health service authorities of the District General Hospital Horana and health staff, including specialists, doctors and nurses.  The spokesman said, the Project named ‘Safe City’ was led by Specialist Dr. Isuru Gayan, at the District General Hospital Horana. It would enable Primary Health Care Hospitals to access any Consultant Specialist serving in a tertiary-care hospital, in any part of the island, using hi tech video technology in order to seek advice and even obtain a prognosis on the patient so that necessary treatment and care could be provided during the first hour (Golden Hour) when his or her life is in danger. Basic treatment services and necessary medicines could be provided to reduce the risk on the patient’s life as a result.  What needs to be noted is that the specialist doctor would be able to examine the patient through video technology – through visual media, whereas formerly it was done only through audio facilities.  The Ministry of Health is working to implement this new programme as a project in the primary hospital service, and an emergency number related to this service (070 500 0 450) has also been introduced. The district health service authorities of the Kalutara District, the hospital authority and the health staff including specialists, doctors and nurses were informed about the project named ‘Safe City’ and about the ‘Telemedicine’ project. It was led by Dr. Isuru Gayan, emergency treatment specialist at Horana District General Hospital.

The event attracted over 100 small businesses and allied stakeholders, including the Eastern Province Tourism Council, the Chamber of Tourism and Industry, Trincomalee District Hotel Association, Batticaloa Hotelier District Association, Pasikudah Homestay District Association, Eastern Province Tour Guides Association, and the Batticaloa and Trincomalee Chambers of Commerce.  The expo was the fourth in a series of similar events conducted across the country and followed previous events held in Colombo, Galle, and Kandy. Participants learned about digital marketing, travel trends, and how to incorporate sustainability into their daily operations. They also had access to mentoring sessions with industry trailblazers and received toolkits focused on product development, marketing, promotions, and sustainability. Sri Lanka’s diverse tourism offerings hold immense potential for small businesses to cater to the demands of both international and domestic travellers. To establish a thriving tourism sector, it is vital to empower small business owners to innovate, refine their products, and deliver sustainable guest experiences aligned with traveller expectations.  Tourism is critical to Sri Lanka’s economy as it exits the pandemic and deals with its internal economic crisis.  Pre-pandemic tourism represented 12 per cent of the country’s GDP, generating USD 4.3 billion in revenue in 2018 and providing employment for three million people.  Sri Lanka is currently experiencing an encouraging resurgence in tourist arrivals and welcomed 1.5 million tourists in 2023 – double the figure of 720,000 recorded for the whole of 2022. Already popular as a tourism destination for its natural beauty and cultural heritage, in June 2023, Sri Lanka repositioned its tourism offering with the launch of 12 new niche tourism categories – from adventure tourism and cultural experiences to hosted/curated experiences and wellness and healing – offering differentiated experiences for travellers seeking an immersive holiday.  Niche tourism allows a destination to provide more inclusive opportunities for women, minority communities, and other disadvantaged groups by creating opportunities for them to participate in their own unique way.  USAID launched the tourism activity under the Indo Pacific Opportunity Project (IPOP) in July 2022 to support economic reforms and promote foreign direct investment in Sri Lanka.  The two-year project is assisting SLTDA to streamline and implement new policies and procedures to enable fast-tracking and attraction of foreign direct investment in the tourism sector. The learning expo is yet another positive step taken by IPOP to boost Sri Lanka’s tourism industry and its economic recovery."

We all have to respect each other. Everyone! The heart of the document is welcome.” Last year, the 87-year-old Pontiff authorised priests to offer informal blessings of couples in ‘irregular’ unions in a landmark document issued on 18  December 2023. It is the first time the Vatican has allowed for such blessings, having previously forbidden any such move. But, the decision has sparked contrasting reactions inside the church. While those in Western churches have largely welcomed the decision, a body representing bishops in Africa said they would not be offering blessings because they “do not consider it appropriate for Africa,” adding that it “would cause confusion and would be in direct contradiction to the cultural ethos of African communities.” The Pope has described the criticism of blessings in Africa as a ‘special case’ influenced by culture, while the African bishops, despite the disagreement, have maintained their loyalty to the Pope. Criticism has also been voiced among a vocal section of conservatives inside the church, many of them in the United States and parts of Europe, and which Pope Francis has previously said “belong to small ideological groups.” The Vatican has insisted that the blessings for same-sex couples are not of the ‘union’ but, for the people who request them. (CNN) “I don’t bless a ‘same-sex marriage,’ I bless two people who love each other and I also ask them to pray for me,” he told priest Don Vincenzo Vitale, who conducted the interview. “Always in confession, when these situations come, homosexual people, remarried people, I always pray and bless.

The Head of State presented the Government policy statement to the House after ceremonially opening the Fifth Session of the Ninth Parliament on Wednesday (7) morning. “Although we may compete in elections separately, let us collaborate in nation-building endeavours to embrace a shared vision and common purpose for our country. Let us initiate change within ourselves, fostering unity and enlightenment.  Together, let us create a new political ethos, dedicated not to personal ambitions but to the collective aspirations of our nation,” he said. President Wickremesinghe, also insisted that the Government aims to alleviate the tax burden on the people as the economy continues to stabilise with the implementation of economic reforms and was hopeful that it will provide room for a potential revision of the Value Added Tax (VAT) percentage, which was increased from 15 per cent to 18 per cent with effect from the outset of 2024. Acknowledging that the VAT hike poses a burden for many people, the President said the Government is systematically addressing this issue. The President said there has been a substantial increase in tax registration, with the number of registered taxpayers soaring from 437,547 in 2022 to 1,000,029 by the end of 2023, recording an increase of 130 per cent. “As the tax network expands, the burden on individuals and organisations will diminish.” He promised to take measures to increase the benefits provided to the people as the Government’s revenue increases. Speaking further on the economic reforms undertaken by the Government to ride out the crisis, Wickremesinghe emphasised that the country is now experiencing tangible growth, which is evident in the current social discourse. “Not long ago, conversations centred around the challenges posed by power cuts, demanding uninterrupted electricity. Today, the discourse has shifted to electricity bills. Previously, concerns were raised about the exorbitant black-market price of petrol, with talk of spending days in fuel queues. Now, the focus is on new oil companies investing in Sri Lanka. Issues related to the scarcity of vegetables have transformed into discussions about the prices of carrots. The prior scarcity of paper for book printing is now replaced by discussions about VAT.” Further, the President expressed optimism about achieving economic growth of 2 per cent to 3 per cent this year, with efforts underway to increase it to 5 per cent by 2025, based on predictions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Stating that his decision-making was driven by the country’s growth and not political gain, the President expressed confidence that, in time, these tough measures would be acknowledged and appreciated by the people. Wickremesinghe said this journey to economic recovery progressed methodically: “In the 2022 Interim Budget, I highlighted the country’s critical situation at that time, aiming to avert an economic collapse. Through the 2023 Budget, several proposals were presented to guide the economy towards stability, showcasing a step-by-step approach to our overarching goals. The 2024 Budget proposals mark the initial stride in essential reforms aimed at propelling economic development.” Despite challenges and occasional reluctance, the President opined that the economic reforms and policies the Government has instituted have set the country on the trajectory towards a stable economy, earning recognition from international financial institutions for our targeted approach. Wickremesinghe also announced plans to implement a debt restructuring strategy within the first half of 2024, which he views as the foundational framework for restoring the economy to normalcy and alleviating debt pressures. “By September 2023, our total debt burden was USD 91 billion. It will take a considerable period to settle this debt.” He stressed the need to source the funds locally to pay off the country’s debt. “It is imperative that we generate this income; otherwise, we risk falling into the debt trap once again.” As a result of debt restructuring, Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would be able to reduce the annual payment. Nevertheless, even under such a situation the country will still have to pay around USD 3 billion per year, he said, adding that we need to create a balance between income and expenditure. “Our Budget deficit is at an acute stage. This year government revenue stood at Rs 4,127 billion and expenditure was Rs 6,978 billion. Out of this, Rs 2,651 billion is for debt repayment. This, clearly, indicates our debt burden.” Emphasising the importance of breaking free from the “shackles of a debt-driven mentality,” the President said Sri Lanka needs to focus on building a robust, independent economy while eliminating the debt economy. “Rapidly increasing export income and foreign investment are crucial components of this transformative journey. […] Central to this process is the eradication of corruption and social modernisation.” Speaking on educational and health reforms, the Head of State said the Government aims to modernise these sectors, ensuring the protection of vulnerable sections and fostering economic growth. As the country’s future heavily relies on new technological knowledge, Wickremesinghe revealed that in pursuit of this goal, the Government is formulating a policy to offer university education to every high school graduate and establishing Science and Technology universities. “We are laying the groundwork to nurture a new generation equipped with contemporary knowledge and technology.” The President extended an invitation to the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to collaborate with him in the nation-building endeavours. “In the interest of the nation’s welfare and the prosperity of our youth, the majority of the Podujana Peramuna have set aside past animosities and reached a consensus. Likewise, longstanding political allies have aligned with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, including those whom I, personally, introduced to the political arena. If the Podujana Peramuna can unite for the greater good, why can’t the Samagi Jana Balawegaya follow suit?” Wickremesinghe said the people should initiate change within themselves, fostering unity and enlightenment."

However, several SJB MPs including Sarath Fonseka, Rajitha Senaratne, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Kumara Welgama, Ishak Rahuman, Vadivel Suresh, Faizal Cassim, and A.H.M. Fowzie remained in the Chamber.  Meanwhile, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella holding a press conference at the Parliament Complex said the SJB will not support the Government as the Government as well as the President had acted arbitrarily in the recent past. The President keeps appealing to the Opposition to join hands with the Government but  the Government has shown no genuine concern for the Opposition, MP Kiriella recalled the recent State  attack on  a peaceful protest organised by the SJB. “We continued to support the Government. We supported it to pass several Acts such as the 21st Amendment. However, the Government has acted arbitrarily in the recent past,” he said. Kiriella added that the Government had also passed the Online Safety Bill without adhering to Supreme Court recommendations where 11 of the recommendations had not been adhered to when enacting the Bill. He said the decentralised budget allocation for MPs had not been given to Opposition MPs this time so as to corner them. The SJB leader said it was not a sudden decision for SJB MPs to walk out of the Chamber at the time President was making the policy statement but that it was a pre-planned decision. Responding to a question whether the SJB would take action against several MPs who remained in the House despite the party decision, Kiriella said no action will be taken against them as they had a right to do so.  “We are a democratic party. They can take their own decision,” he said."

Rukshan, yesterday (7), noted that the increase in the bread price as a result of the increase in its weight had also increased the cost consumers had to pay for their morning meal of bread and curry.  “The person who enjoys eating half a loaf of bread with curries was forced to consume three-quarter of it. Bakeries put more yeast than flour when baking bread so that the loaf expands,” he said. The price of a loaf of bread earlier was Rs 130, then Rs 140 as the weight of a loaf of bread at that time was 330 grams. But with the increase in weight from 330 grams to 450 grams bakery owners also took steps to increase the price of bread – “so much so that currently there is no price control on bread,” he lamented. Rukshan said the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) had taken a praiseworthy step on Friday (2) by issuing a special gazette regulating the weight of bread this week. “A loaf of bread should be 450 grams. Consumers can thus get value for their money,” he said. He noted that Trade Minister Nalin Fernando and his Ministry were responsible for controlling the alleged ‘egg mafia,’ by importing eggs and making it possible for the public to purchase eggs at a lower cost. “Most customers who patronise eateries and restaurants prefer eating bread. Eateries and restaurants have only a Rs 10 profit from bread.”  “Including a coconut sambal, eatery and restaurant owners could provide several curries if the cost of a loaf of bread was made affordable once more,” he added. “There is a tendency for people to consume bread over rice. The majority of them eat bread for breakfast and dinner. Therefore, a price control should be introduced for bread as well. If the cost of bread is increased as a result of the gazette which increased its weight, people would have no choice but to skip at least two meals to cope with the inflation in bread price,” he further said. The ACROA Chairman said at present the price of a loaf of bread had increased to Rs 160. "

The three-day protest in early January was organised by the CEB Trade Union Alliance demanding the Government to reduce the increase in electricity bills and to repeal the proposed Sri Lanka Electricity Bill which the trade unions claim is a move by Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara to split the CEB into 12 sections and privatise the institution.  CEB United Trade Union Alliance Convener Ranjan Jayalal told media that the islandwide protest held yesterday was a warning to Minister Wijesekara and the Government, which he claims has been alarmed following the three-day protest in January, that if the 62 employees are not reinstated, and the trade union leaders who have been transferred following the protest, if electricity tariffs are not reduced and the proposed Electricity Bill is not repealed the CEB trade unions will take trade union action that could possibly cripple the Government. He further added that given the opening of the Fifth Session of the Ninth Parliament of Sri Lanka scheduled for yesterday, the CEB trade union alliance wanted to bring attention to these concerns, so that MPs would prioritise addressing these in the new parliament session. Dilan Roshan, an employee at the CEB Distribution Division 3 headquarters who participated in yesterday’s protest on the Sri Jayewardenepura Mawatha told Ceylon Today that yesterday’s protest was held during the lunch break so as to not inconvenience the public. “We are not in the streets asking for incentives and bonuses for ourselves. Our office came out on the street because we felt that we have a responsibility to be seen by all MPs who would drive down this road to attend Parliament.

There were instances in the recent past, where MPs came to Parliament even from hospital beds with health staff carrying bottles of saline when their presence and vote was crucial. However, Rambukwella has declined the offer to be present in Parliament when the Fifth Session of the Ninth Parliament was ceremonially opened by President Ranil Wickremesinghe last morning. On Tuesday (6), the former health minister had tendered his resignation to President Ranil Wickremesinghe who in turn had accepted it. Later, a Gazette Notification was published, confirming the resignation of Rambukwella as Environment Minister. MP Rambukwella was arrested on 2 February after he arrived at the CID to record a statement on the substandard human immunoglobulin procurement scandal. He was reportedly interrogated for nearly 10 hours before being arrested."

He said according to the discussions that have taken place so far, it is doubtful whether ‘Suraksha’ Student Insurance benefits can be provided in 2024.   Meanwhile, a senior official from the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) told Ceylon Today that ‘Suraksha’ Student Insurance benefits have been provided until 2022 and the Ministry of Education has not informed to provide any provision for the years 2023 and 2024.  He mentioned that until 31 January 2023, ‘Suraksha’ Student Insurance benefits have been provided to schoolchildren and no payment has been made in the last year and the New Year.   He said as a result of a policy decision taken by the Government, the ‘Suraksha’ Student Insurance Scheme, which was started in 2017, was halted, but the President mentioned that provision has been made for it in this year’s Budget.  However, according to Education Ministry sources, the Government has not taken a final decision regarding the provision of the ‘Suraksha’ Student Insurance Scheme in 2024.   They said several discussions were held at the President’s Office and no instructions have been received so far to provide ‘Suraksha’ Student Insurance benefits.    Ceylon Today attempted to contact the Secretary of the Ministry of Education on 180 occasions to inquire about the provision of ‘Suraksha’ Student Insurance benefits this year to no avail."

The Tourism Minister, speaking at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM), India’s leading and only travel show focused on outbound travel, said, “I will break the news that Indian companies are taking our three airports which is going to be a phenomenal decision to really help us. The fuel tanks are taken by the Indian companies, the solar power projects are also taken by the Indians.” Further, the Minister of Tourism also told a Hindu Businessline journalist and the Hindustan Times, Pune News and many other Indian media outlets that were present at the roadshow that discussions are underway between the two sides, potentially involving management contracts. The newspaper quoted Minister Fernando as stating that the Adani Group is in negotiations with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including the BIA. He mentioned plans to collaborate with the Adani Group for airport management, as reported by Businessline on the sidelines of the OTM show in Mumbai. Sources informed Ceylon Today that Minister Fernando has been requested to provide clarification on the matter, as the Sri Lankan Government has no plans to allocate shares to any foreign investors for the BIA or the Ratmalana International Airport. The only finalised agreement concerns the sale of the Mattala Airport to a Russo-Indian joint venture. According to the Aviation Ministry, the statement made by Minister Fernando during the Mumbai roadshow regarding the transfer of the three airports to an Indian investor was misleading information. The Government has clarified that there are no such plans in place for such a transfer. Additionally, the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit has stated that they have no knowledge of the developments regarding the airport proposals. Ceylon Today has previously reported that the Mattala Airport will be managed by Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company (AR), in collaboration with an Indian firm, as a joint venture. Sources indicate that the Indian company involved in this venture is likely to be the Adani Group. Secretary of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, however, told Ceylon Today that discussions have led to an agreement to transfer the operations of MRIA to a private joint venture and it is being finalised, but the Secretary did not disclose the names of the investors. "

The President reiterated Sri Lanka’s commitment to supporting regional efforts in climate change mitigation and adaptation. He highlighted initiatives such as the establishment of an international climate change university, aimed at providing postgraduate education and training to officials from various countries. Additionally, the President proposed the creation of a tropical belt as a carbon sink as discussed during COP28 in Dubai, emphasising the importance of private sector investment in sustainable development projects within this region. Regarding mitigation efforts, the President outlined Sri Lanka’s plans to enhance its meteorological organisations despite recent challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and economic crises. He underscored the necessity of a comprehensive Hydromet regional network to effectively address climate change-related challenges, particularly in South Asia, where the adverse effects are mostly felt. The Forum, scheduled to run until 8 February, aims to facilitate discussions and collaborations on hydrology and meteorology-related initiatives in South Asia. SAHF initiated in 2018, connects National Meteorological and Hydrological Service providers (NMHSs) from the region to promote data and knowledge exchange, addressing technical challenges and enhancing collaboration.  Reflecting on the urgent need for action, the President drew attention to the economic repercussions of climate change, citing potential GDP losses of up to 2 per cent in low-income countries. He recounted Sri Lanka’s recent experiences with unexpected rainfall and highlighted the broader regional impacts, including those stemming from the melting of the Himalayas. President Wickremesinghe underscored the necessity of establishing a regional network to facilitate collective action. In addition to this, the Sri Lankan Government is actively promoting two key initiatives. Firstly, plans are underway to establish an international climate change university, designed to offer postgraduate programmes akin to those provided by institutions like the East-West Center in Hawaii. Discussions are ongoing with various countries and institutions to ensure its establishment as a stakeholder university, aimed at fostering comprehensive engagement. This endeavour is expected to play a vital role in addressing climate challenges not only in Sri Lanka but also across the region and in Africa. Secondly, President Wickremesinghe outlined a significant proposal presented at the Dubai COP28, emphasising the concept of utilising the tropical belt as a carbon sink. Highlighting the potential of the tropical belt, with its diverse ecosystems including marshes and forests, to absorb carbon emissions, he underscored its suitability as a prime region for carbon sequestration. The President stressed the importance of facilitating private sector investment in these countries to support such initiatives, emphasising that leveraging private investments is crucial for achieving sustainable development goals. He emphasised that while traditional sources of aid may not suffice, attracting private-sector investments could yield substantial benefits for all parties involved. Moreover, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the collaborative efforts within the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) to explore opportunities across the region. To advance this proposal, he announced plans to establish a panel of experts to conduct in-depth studies. Further, the President discussed potential funding mechanisms, suggesting the establishment of a loss and damage fund to address residual challenges. While acknowledging the challenges of securing funding solely for loss and damage, he proposed exploring alternative avenues, including debt relief for countries willing to invest in climate mitigation efforts within the tropical belt. These measures, he asserted, are essential for realising the potential of the tropical belt as a key contributor to global carbon reduction efforts. President Wickremesinghe concluded by expressing hope that the discussions at the Forum would lead to innovative solutions and initiatives to tackle climate change in the region. He encouraged participants to contribute their ideas and expertise to ongoing projects aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation. Co-Chair of the South Asia Hydromet Forum (SAHF) and Director of the National Centre for Hydrology and Meteorology in Bhutan, Karma Dupchu, along with esteemed guests including Director of the South Asia Region at the World Bank (WB), Dina Umali-Deininger and High Commissioner of the United Kingdom, Andrew Patrick, convened at the Forum. Also in attendance were Director for Regional Integration in South Asia at the World Bank, Cecile Fruman, and Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Celeste Saulo, among other distinguished participants from the region."
