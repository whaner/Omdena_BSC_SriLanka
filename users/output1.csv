How PrEP works Who needs PrEP? ,"PrEP is a pill that protects you from HIV. It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period. Currently, NSACP is providing PrEP to selected higher-risk members of men who have sex with men and transgender-women communities. Your eligibility for PrEP will be carefully assessed by our doctors. Some examples of important criteria: You will be offered the following tests free of charge The National STD/AIDS Control Programme (NSACP) of the Ministry of Health is the main government organization which coordinate the national response to sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka.

Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period. Currently, NSACP is providing PrEP to selected higher-risk members of men who have sex with men and transgender-women communities. Your eligibility for PrEP will be carefully assessed by our doctors.

This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

They also include negative consequences or conditions, such as: To promote sexual health, it is essential to have access to accurate information and resources. We offer educational resources, such as videos, brochures, and posters, which are available for download and use in health promotion activities. In addition, the National STD/AIDS Control Programme provides training for healthcare providers and community-based organizations to increase awareness of sexual and reproductive health and improve access to sexual health services. We believe that everyone has the right to sexual health and access to sexual health services without stigma or discrimination. Visit us to preserve your sexual health rights and for free access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services available in Sri Lanka, while safeguarding your privacy and confidentiality. Gender-Based Violence (GBV) During the clinical assessments at sexual health clinics, we identify females who currently experience intimate partner violence (IPV) and domestic violence. Those females will be provided with extensive counselling apart from empowerment with knowledge (on sexual and reproductive health, human rights, HIV and STI symptoms, modes of transmission/ and prevention, facilities available in the government and private sector, and contraceptive methods), skills, and confidence to tackle them. Depending on the extent of the physical and mental insult, females will be referred to relevant specialties such as psychiatry, gynaecology, surgery, etc. for further management. Hence, healthcare workers at NSACP will be a part of the multidisciplinary team that manages and cares for GBV victims. Furthermore, the victims will be referred to legal and social services whenever necessary. Sexual Dysfunction Sexual health clinics are conducted every Monday (except for public holidays) at NSACP by qualified doctors. There, people will be educated on various aspects of sexual and reproductive health. There are various causes leading to sexual dysfunction among males and females. They will be assessed according to their history as well as by clinical examination, and necessary investigations will be arranged accordingly.  The National STD/AIDS Control Programme (NSACP) of the Ministry of Health is the main government organization which coordinate the national response to sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka.

The Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV programme was launched in the year 2002. In 2013 this programme was improved as an EMTCT programme and measures were taken to scale up testing services among pregnant women throughout the country aiming at reaching >95% testing of pregnant women for HIV by the end of 2016. Most of the provinces of the country have already initiated the programme. Sri Lanka has satisfactory MCH services with more than 99% of the antenatal population receiving antenatal care and delivering in health care institutions. The term “validation” is used to attest that a country has successfully met the criteria for EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis at a specific point in time. “Validation of EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis” implies that countries will also need to maintain ongoing, routine, effective programme interventions and quality surveillance systems to monitor EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period.

This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

In 2013 this programme was improved as EMTCT programme and measures were taken to scale up testing services among pregnant women throughout the country aiming at reaching >95% testing of pregnant women for HIV by end 2016. Most of the provinces of the country have already initiated the programme. Sri Lanka has satisfactory MCH services with more than 99% of the antenatal population receiving antenatal care and delivering in health care institutions. The term “validation” is used to attest that a country has successfully met criteria for EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis at a specific point in time. “Validation of EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis” implies that countries will also need to maintain ongoing, routine, effective programme interventions and quality surveillance systems to monitor EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis.

This page provides you with information, resources, and guidance on how to maintain and promote your sexual health. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships and the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences free of coercion, discrimination, and violence. There is a broad range of sexual health-related issues, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual expression, relationships, and pleasure. They also include negative consequences or conditions, such as: To promote sexual health, it is essential to have access to accurate information and resources. We offer educational resources, such as videos, brochures, and posters, which are available for download and use in health promotion activities. In addition, the National STD/AIDS Control Programme provides training for healthcare providers and community-based organizations to increase awareness of sexual and reproductive health and improve access to sexual health services. We believe that everyone has the right to sexual health and access to sexual health services without stigma or discrimination. Visit us to preserve your sexual health rights and for free access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services available in Sri Lanka, while safeguarding your privacy and confidentiality. Gender-Based Violence (GBV) During the clinical assessments at sexual health clinics, we identify females who currently experience intimate partner violence (IPV) and domestic violence. Those females will be provided with extensive counselling apart from empowerment with knowledge (on sexual and reproductive health, human rights, HIV and STI symptoms, modes of transmission/ and prevention, facilities available in the government and private sector, and contraceptive methods), skills, and confidence to tackle them. Depending on the extent of the physical and mental insult, females will be referred to relevant specialties such as psychiatry, gynaecology, surgery, etc. for further management. Hence, healthcare workers at NSACP will be a part of the multidisciplinary team that manages and cares for GBV victims. Furthermore, the victims will be referred to legal and social services whenever necessary. Sexual Dysfunction Sexual health clinics are conducted every Monday (except for public holidays) at NSACP by qualified doctors. There, people will be educated on various aspects of sexual and reproductive health. There are various causes leading to sexual dysfunction among males and females. They will be assessed according to their history as well as by clinical examination, and necessary investigations will be arranged accordingly.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network.

It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period. Currently, NSACP is providing PrEP to selected higher-risk members of men who have sex with men and transgender-women communities. Your eligibility for PrEP will be carefully assessed by our doctors.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period. Currently, NSACP is providing PrEP to selected higher-risk members of men who have sex with men and transgender-women communities. Your eligibility for PrEP will be carefully assessed by our doctors.

This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

Visit us to preserve your sexual health rights and for free access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services available in Sri Lanka, while safeguarding your privacy and confidentiality. Gender-Based Violence (GBV) During the clinical assessments at sexual health clinics, we identify females who currently experience intimate partner violence (IPV) and domestic violence. Those females will be provided with extensive counselling apart from empowerment with knowledge (on sexual and reproductive health, human rights, HIV and STI symptoms, modes of transmission/ and prevention, facilities available in the government and private sector, and contraceptive methods), skills, and confidence to tackle them. Depending on the extent of the physical and mental insult, females will be referred to relevant specialties such as psychiatry, gynaecology, surgery, etc. for further management. Hence, healthcare workers at NSACP will be a part of the multidisciplinary team that manages and cares for GBV victims. Furthermore, the victims will be referred to legal and social services whenever necessary. Sexual Dysfunction Sexual health clinics are conducted every Monday (except for public holidays) at NSACP by qualified doctors.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

Prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV programme was launched in the year 2002. In 2013 this programme was improved as EMTCT programme and measures were taken to scale up testing services among pregnant women throughout the country aiming at reaching >95% testing of pregnant women for HIV by end 2016. Most of the provinces of the country have already initiated the programme. Sri Lanka has satisfactory MCH services with more than 99% of the antenatal population receiving antenatal care and delivering in health care institutions. The term “validation” is used to attest that a country has successfully met criteria for EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis at a specific point in time. “Validation of EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis” implies that countries will also need to maintain ongoing, routine, effective programme interventions and quality surveillance systems to monitor EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis.

This page provides you with information, resources, and guidance on how to maintain and promote your sexual health. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships and the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences free of coercion, discrimination, and violence. There is a broad range of sexual health-related issues, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual expression, relationships, and pleasure. They also include negative consequences or conditions, such as: To promote sexual health, it is essential to have access to accurate information and resources. We offer educational resources, such as videos, brochures, and posters, which are available for download and use in health promotion activities. In addition, the National STD/AIDS Control Programme provides training for healthcare providers and community-based organizations to increase awareness of sexual and reproductive health and improve access to sexual health services. We believe that everyone has the right to sexual health and access to sexual health services without stigma or discrimination. Visit us to preserve your sexual health rights and for free access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services available in Sri Lanka, while safeguarding your privacy and confidentiality. Gender-Based Violence (GBV) During the clinical assessments at sexual health clinics, we identify females who currently experience intimate partner violence (IPV) and domestic violence. Those females will be provided with extensive counselling apart from empowerment with knowledge (on sexual and reproductive health, human rights, HIV and STI symptoms, modes of transmission/ and prevention, facilities available in the government and private sector, and contraceptive methods), skills, and confidence to tackle them. Depending on the extent of the physical and mental insult, females will be referred to relevant specialties such as psychiatry, gynaecology, surgery, etc. for further management. Hence, healthcare workers at NSACP will be a part of the multidisciplinary team that manages and cares for GBV victims. Furthermore, the victims will be referred to legal and social services whenever necessary. Sexual Dysfunction Sexual health clinics are conducted every Monday (except for public holidays) at NSACP by qualified doctors. There, people will be educated on various aspects of sexual and reproductive health. There are various causes leading to sexual dysfunction among males and females. They will be assessed according to their history as well as by clinical examination, and necessary investigations will be arranged accordingly.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs.

Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network.

Prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV programme was launched in the year 2002. In 2013 this programme was improved as EMTCT programme and measures were taken to scale up testing services among pregnant women throughout the country aiming at reaching >95% testing of pregnant women for HIV by end 2016. Most of the provinces of the country have already initiated the programme. Sri Lanka has satisfactory MCH services with more than 99% of the antenatal population receiving antenatal care and delivering in health care institutions. The term “validation” is used to attest that a country has successfully met criteria for EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis at a specific point in time. “Validation of EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis” implies that countries will also need to maintain ongoing, routine, effective programme interventions and quality surveillance systems to monitor EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis. Global indicators for validation for the elimination of MTCT of HIV and syphilis.

It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period. Currently, NSACP is providing PrEP to selected higher-risk members of men who have sex with men and transgender-women communities. Your eligibility for PrEP will be carefully assessed by our doctors.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period. Currently, NSACP is providing PrEP to selected higher-risk members of men who have sex with men and transgender-women communities. Your eligibility for PrEP will be carefully assessed by our doctors.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

With the implementation of the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission program island wide service provision and testing of pregnant mothers are integrated into the maternal and child health care package through the local medical officer of health. The elimination of MTCT of HIV and syphilis will help to improve a broad range of maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes and also directly contribute to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), specifically MDGs 4 and 5, which aim to reduce child mortality and improve maternal health, and MDG 6, which aims to reduce the spread of HIV, malaria, and other diseases. The Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV programme was launched in the year 2002. In 2013 this programme was improved as an EMTCT programme and measures were taken to scale up testing services among pregnant women throughout the country aiming at reaching >95% testing of pregnant women for HIV by the end of 2016. Most of the provinces of the country have already initiated the programme. Sri Lanka has satisfactory MCH services with more than 99% of the antenatal population receiving antenatal care and delivering in health care institutions. The term “validation” is used to attest that a country has successfully met the criteria for EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis at a specific point in time. “Validation of EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis” implies that countries will also need to maintain ongoing, routine, effective programme interventions and quality surveillance systems to monitor EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

Prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV programme was launched in the year 2002. In 2013 this programme was improved as EMTCT programme and measures were taken to scale up testing services among pregnant women throughout the country aiming at reaching >95% testing of pregnant women for HIV by end 2016. Most of the provinces of the country have already initiated the programme. Sri Lanka has satisfactory MCH services with more than 99% of the antenatal population receiving antenatal care and delivering in health care institutions. The term “validation” is used to attest that a country has successfully met criteria for EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis at a specific point in time. “Validation of EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis” implies that countries will also need to maintain ongoing, routine, effective programme interventions and quality surveillance systems to monitor EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis.

This page provides you with information, resources, and guidance on how to maintain and promote your sexual health. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships and the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences free of coercion, discrimination, and violence. There is a broad range of sexual health-related issues, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual expression, relationships, and pleasure. They also include negative consequences or conditions, such as: To promote sexual health, it is essential to have access to accurate information and resources. We offer educational resources, such as videos, brochures, and posters, which are available for download and use in health promotion activities. In addition, the National STD/AIDS Control Programme provides training for healthcare providers and community-based organizations to increase awareness of sexual and reproductive health and improve access to sexual health services. We believe that everyone has the right to sexual health and access to sexual health services without stigma or discrimination. Visit us to preserve your sexual health rights and for free access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services available in Sri Lanka, while safeguarding your privacy and confidentiality. Gender-Based Violence (GBV) During the clinical assessments at sexual health clinics, we identify females who currently experience intimate partner violence (IPV) and domestic violence. Those females will be provided with extensive counselling apart from empowerment with knowledge (on sexual and reproductive health, human rights, HIV and STI symptoms, modes of transmission/ and prevention, facilities available in the government and private sector, and contraceptive methods), skills, and confidence to tackle them. Depending on the extent of the physical and mental insult, females will be referred to relevant specialties such as psychiatry, gynaecology, surgery, etc. for further management. Hence, healthcare workers at NSACP will be a part of the multidisciplinary team that manages and cares for GBV victims. Furthermore, the victims will be referred to legal and social services whenever necessary. Sexual Dysfunction Sexual health clinics are conducted every Monday (except for public holidays) at NSACP by qualified doctors. There, people will be educated on various aspects of sexual and reproductive health. There are various causes leading to sexual dysfunction among males and females. They will be assessed according to their history as well as by clinical examination, and necessary investigations will be arranged accordingly.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period.

This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network.

It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period. Currently, NSACP is providing PrEP to selected higher-risk members of men who have sex with men and transgender-women communities. Your eligibility for PrEP will be carefully assessed by our doctors. Some examples of important criteria: You will be offered the following tests free of charge The National STD/AIDS Control Programme (NSACP) of the Ministry of Health is the main government organization which coordinate the national response to sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

Prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV programme was launched in the year 2002. In 2013 this programme was improved as EMTCT programme and measures were taken to scale up testing services among pregnant women throughout the country aiming at reaching >95% testing of pregnant women for HIV by end 2016. Most of the provinces of the country have already initiated the programme. Sri Lanka has satisfactory MCH services with more than 99% of the antenatal population receiving antenatal care and delivering in health care institutions. The term “validation” is used to attest that a country has successfully met criteria for EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis at a specific point in time. “Validation of EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis” implies that countries will also need to maintain ongoing, routine, effective programme interventions and quality surveillance systems to monitor EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

Prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV programme was launched in the year 2002. In 2013 this programme was improved as EMTCT programme and measures were taken to scale up testing services among pregnant women throughout the country aiming at reaching >95% testing of pregnant women for HIV by end 2016. Most of the provinces of the country have already initiated the programme. Sri Lanka has satisfactory MCH services with more than 99% of the antenatal population receiving antenatal care and delivering in health care institutions. The term “validation” is used to attest that a country has successfully met criteria for EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis at a specific point in time. “Validation of EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis” implies that countries will also need to maintain ongoing, routine, effective programme interventions and quality surveillance systems to monitor EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis. Global indicators for validation for the elimination of MTCT of HIV and syphilis. Impact indicators: Process indicators: According to the available statistics Sri Lanka has already achieved the impact indicators and ready for application for the WHO validation certificate.

Those females will be provided with extensive counselling apart from empowerment with knowledge (on sexual and reproductive health, human rights, HIV and STI symptoms, modes of transmission/ and prevention, facilities available in the government and private sector, and contraceptive methods), skills, and confidence to tackle them. Depending on the extent of the physical and mental insult, females will be referred to relevant specialties such as psychiatry, gynaecology, surgery, etc. for further management. Hence, healthcare workers at NSACP will be a part of the multidisciplinary team that manages and cares for GBV victims. Furthermore, the victims will be referred to legal and social services whenever necessary. Sexual Dysfunction Sexual health clinics are conducted every Monday (except for public holidays) at NSACP by qualified doctors. There, people will be educated on various aspects of sexual and reproductive health. There are various causes leading to sexual dysfunction among males and females. They will be assessed according to their history as well as by clinical examination, and necessary investigations will be arranged accordingly.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period. Currently, NSACP is providing PrEP to selected higher-risk members of men who have sex with men and transgender-women communities. Your eligibility for PrEP will be carefully assessed by our doctors.

This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you.

It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period. Currently, NSACP is providing PrEP to selected higher-risk members of men who have sex with men and transgender-women communities. Your eligibility for PrEP will be carefully assessed by our doctors.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

The Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV programme was launched in the year 2002. In 2013 this programme was improved as an EMTCT programme and measures were taken to scale up testing services among pregnant women throughout the country aiming at reaching >95% testing of pregnant women for HIV by the end of 2016. Most of the provinces of the country have already initiated the programme. Sri Lanka has satisfactory MCH services with more than 99% of the antenatal population receiving antenatal care and delivering in health care institutions. The term “validation” is used to attest that a country has successfully met the criteria for EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis at a specific point in time. “Validation of EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis” implies that countries will also need to maintain ongoing, routine, effective programme interventions and quality surveillance systems to monitor EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis.

It is a course of tablets that you take before and after sex. These tablets can be taken daily (daily regimen) or as required (event-driven). PrEP with a combination of two anti-HIV (antiretroviral) drugs (Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine) are highly effective in preventing HIV infection if taken correctly. If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection. This can be prevented if these medicines that stop HIV reproduction are present in the body at this time. In the case of PrEP, medicines are present before sex and continue throughout the risk period. Currently, NSACP is providing PrEP to selected higher-risk members of men who have sex with men and transgender-women communities. Your eligibility for PrEP will be carefully assessed by our doctors. Some examples of important criteria: You will be offered the following tests free of charge The National STD/AIDS Control Programme (NSACP) of the Ministry of Health is the main government organization which coordinate the national response to sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

Prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV programme was launched in the year 2002. In 2013 this programme was improved as EMTCT programme and measures were taken to scale up testing services among pregnant women throughout the country aiming at reaching >95% testing of pregnant women for HIV by end 2016. Most of the provinces of the country have already initiated the programme. Sri Lanka has satisfactory MCH services with more than 99% of the antenatal population receiving antenatal care and delivering in health care institutions. The term “validation” is used to attest that a country has successfully met criteria for EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis at a specific point in time. “Validation of EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis” implies that countries will also need to maintain ongoing, routine, effective programme interventions and quality surveillance systems to monitor EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.

If HIV gets inside the cells of the body due to unprotected sex, etc., it takes about 72 hours to spread to the whole body and establish an infection.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:condom-promotion&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=264,,"Welcome to the Condoms and Lubricants page of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka. This page provides information on condoms and lubricants to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Condoms Condoms are widely used barrier methods of contraception (prevent unplanned pregnancies) and common, simple modes of HIV and STD prevention. It is important to use a separate condom every time you have sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Studies suggest that condoms are 90-95% effective in STI and HIV prevention when used correctly and consistently. Also, consistent condom users are 10-20 times less likely to become infected with HIV than inconsistent or non-users of condoms. Condoms are made up of several materials,Latex rubber, Polyurethane etc.When using a condom, it is important to check the date of expiry, open the package carefully, and make sure there are no tears or holes. Islandwide HIV and STD clinics provide male and female condoms made up of latex rubber, free of charge. Occasionally, latex can cause allergic reactions in very few numbers of individuals. Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that reduce the friction, pain, genital trauma and condom breakage during sexual intercourse (especially in anal sex). There are various types of lubricants as: Certain lubricants contain additives that give specific desired properties, such as colours, flavours, and fragrances. It is important to apply the lubricant on the outside of the condom, and avoid using oil-based products, such as lotions, creams or petroleum jelly, as they can weaken the condom and cause it to break. NSACP provides access to free condoms and lubricants through the island wide STD clinics and community-based organizations/NGOs. We also offer educational resources on how to use condoms and lubricants correctly, including videos, brochures, and posters. Let’s work together to promote safe and healthy sex for all.

Prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV programme was launched in the year 2002. In 2013 this programme was improved as EMTCT programme and measures were taken to scale up testing services among pregnant women throughout the country aiming at reaching >95% testing of pregnant women for HIV by end 2016. Most of the provinces of the country have already initiated the programme. Sri Lanka has satisfactory MCH services with more than 99% of the antenatal population receiving antenatal care and delivering in health care institutions. The term “validation” is used to attest that a country has successfully met criteria for EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis at a specific point in time. “Validation of EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis” implies that countries will also need to maintain ongoing, routine, effective programme interventions and quality surveillance systems to monitor EMTCT of HIV and/or syphilis. Global indicators for validation for the elimination of MTCT of HIV and syphilis. Impact indicators: Process indicators: According to the available statistics Sri Lanka has already achieved the impact indicators and ready for application for the WHO validation certificate.

Those females will be provided with extensive counselling apart from empowerment with knowledge (on sexual and reproductive health, human rights, HIV and STI symptoms, modes of transmission/ and prevention, facilities available in the government and private sector, and contraceptive methods), skills, and confidence to tackle them. Depending on the extent of the physical and mental insult, females will be referred to relevant specialties such as psychiatry, gynaecology, surgery, etc. for further management. Hence, healthcare workers at NSACP will be a part of the multidisciplinary team that manages and cares for GBV victims. Furthermore, the victims will be referred to legal and social services whenever necessary. Sexual Dysfunction Sexual health clinics are conducted every Monday (except for public holidays) at NSACP by qualified doctors. There, people will be educated on various aspects of sexual and reproductive health. There are various causes leading to sexual dysfunction among males and females. They will be assessed according to their history as well as by clinical examination, and necessary investigations will be arranged accordingly.

https://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126:q-a-forum&catid=2&lang=en&Itemid=295,," Questions related to sexually transmitted infections The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly there will be few, or no symptoms and you might not know you have an STI. If there is risky sexual exposure, go to an STD clinic and get yourself tested. The symptoms of STIs in males are, The symptoms depend on the STI you have. Mostly, there will be few, or no symptoms, and they might not know that they have an STI. The symptoms of STIs in females are, Yes, treatment is available for STIs, Some STIs can be completely cured. Some can be controlled to relieve symptoms. STIs caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but STIs caused by viruses may not be cured, although they can be managed. HIV-related questions For further info Without any medication, about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years of becoming infected. This time varies greatly from person to person and depends on many factors. There are host-specific and virus-related factors that influence the progression of HIV infection. Anti-retroviral treatment has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. The only way to find out whether you are infected with HIV or not is to get an HIV test done. There is no test to identify HIV just after infection. There is a time lag between HIV entering the body and when a test can detect the virus or the antibodies developed in the body against the virus. It is called the ""window period."" So, if you test too soon, there is a possibility that you may get a falsely negative result. The window period varies according to the test that you are being tested with. The combined antigen-antibody test, which is used in our clinics for screening, can pick up the viral antigen (P24) in 2 to 6 weeks after infection. But the window period from finger prick rapid detection or oraquick (Saliva) test may take a little longer.  Almost every HIV-positive individual has detectable antibodies at 3 months. There are only three ways in which HIV can be transmitted from one person to another. Important to note, HIV is present in blood and semen, which means that this is a possible transmission route. There may be an increased risk if there is ejaculation, bleeding gums or sores anywhere in the mouth or around the lips (or genitals), or inflammation caused by common throat infections or sexually transmitted infections. Other STIs like syphilis, herpes, and gonorrhoea can be transmitted through oral sex. HIV is not transmitted by kissing, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Your unbroken skin is a good barrier even if the other person has the virus. No one has become infected by such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. Open-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. True. There is no barrier to getting married if you have an STI or HIV. But you must take all the precautions to prevent your marital partner from acquiring the illness from you. If it is HIV, you should come to regular clinic visits, keep your viral load undetectable, and always use condoms. We encourage the divulgence of your status to your partner, which helps in a healthy and responsible relationship. Using condoms correctly and consistently can prevent HIV transmission from an infected person to a partner. If you are already infected, taking HIV medicines as prescribed by your doctor is of utmost importance since the transmission risk is zero if your viral load is undetectable. (U=U Undetectable=Untransmittable). If there is a difficulty in using condoms consistently, there is another method of HIV prevention called Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) where people who don’t have HIV take HIV medication to reduce their risk of getting HIV. PrEP is also available in STD clinics, and you can discuss with the doctor your suitability. Masturbation is a healthy form of sexual gratification. It does not have a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection or any chance of pregnancy. It can help you reduce stress, improve your mood, and relax. But some people don't masturbate. Those people are also considered normal. But it will be problematic if you get addicted to masturbation and addicted to pornography, which would affect your day-to-day activities and lead to low sexual sensations during sexual intercourse. The size of the penis varies among different individuals. A micro penis is an abnormality that is diagnosed medically when the size of the erect penis is less than 3 inches, but it is only present in less than 1% of the population. The size of the penis does not affect the sexual satisfaction of the male or his partner, and there are no approved medications to increase the size of the penis. For further info It is a method of HIV prevention to be taken before possible exposure to HIV infection. It can be taken daily or event-driven basis. This is available from the STD clinic network. For further info A range of services including counselling, testing, and Post Exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for you. Please visit the nearest STD clinic or call the PEP hotline for further information.

History records that the first VD clinics were set up in 1886, in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Even before that the Vagrance ordinance No 4 of 1841, the Contagious Disease Ordinance No 17 of 1867 and the Brothels Ordinance No5 of 1889 were passed in view of controlling venereal diseases. In 1878, Lock Wards were established in Colombo and Kandy to treat women. In 1920, late Sir Winston Churchill visited Ceylon and following this visit control measures were established in a more organized manner and the Ceylon National Council for the control of VD was established. In 1921, a clinic was opened in the Colombo Port for the benefit of sailors. In 1928, Ceylon was a signatory to the Brussels agreement to provide treatment for sailors. Since 1952, measures to control venereal diseases in Ceylon were the responsibility of the Anti VD Campaign. Control of venereal diseases were in existence for a nearly hundred years and in 1949, at the request of the Government of Ceylon, the World Health Organization made available to us the services of a venereal disease consultant, Professor George Leiby. Thereafter under the leadership of Dr S M Laird a venereal disease control team arrived in July 1951 to plan a coordinated programme for Sri Lanka and the Anti Venereal Disease Campaign was established in 1952. Apart from strengthening clinic services, the WHO team recommended certain strategies. Since 1952, routine prenatal and pre employment blood screening was introduced. In 1953, another routine examination that of blood testing of all admissions to the Eye Hospital Colombo was commenced. These strategies have helped in controlling venereal diseases in Ceylon.
